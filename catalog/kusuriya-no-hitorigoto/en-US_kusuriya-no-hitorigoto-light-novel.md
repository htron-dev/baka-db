## Sinopse

There is a certain large country in the central plains of the mainland. In the imperial court of its emperor, there is a girl. Her name is Maomao, a pharmacist from the prostitution quarter, currently working as a maidservant in the inner palace. The girl, surely not considered a beauty, is keeping a low-profile waiting for her contract to end. She was confident that she would not be made a "chosen/mistress" of the emperor, but during the time in the court, she learns about the short lives of his children. Maomao, hearing that the two surviving children are critically ill, begins to investigate the cause—

Set in the middle ages of the East, the "food taster" girl continues to solve difficult cases in the imperial court one after another.
