## Sinopse

Everyday after school, the four members of the broadcasting club uses the broadcasting room as a place to isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Third years in high school, each of them have their own problems, from light to heavy, but when they're here, they're only surrounded only by their friend and it simply feel nice and relaxing to spend time in there.

The story follows each of the four girls as they're forced one after another to face their own problem and to deal with the reaction of their friends, and the final inevitable loss of that "secret garden" as the graduation ceremony comes closer.
