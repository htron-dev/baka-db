## Sinopse

Condemned by her fiancé, second prince Edward Tone Tasmeria, and his lover Yuri Neuer, Iris Lana Armelia recalls visions of her past life in the midst of her downfall: that of an ordinary office lady at a tax agency. Her current life, coincidentally, greatly resembled an otome game she once played. But this knowledge comes too late to be of any help, and Iris is forced home in shame, expelled from school and her engagement ruined.

Though she is put under house arrest, Iris is able to convince her father to make her acting lord of their fiefdom. Now, utilizing knowledge and skills from her memories of modern-day Japan, she sets out to bring prosperity to her people. However, Iris comes to realize that, while similar, this world is also distinctly different from the game. The factions of the first prince and the second prince compete for power, and the Armelia Fiefdom, an economic hub under the leadership of Iris, must take a side as well.
