## Sinopse

On his way back from work on Christmas night, Yamada (26) discovers a drunk and crying high school boy and takes him home. That boy was mulling over being in love with someone of the same sex. A straight adult and a gay high-schooler. It is a piece that sets gender aside as their hearts grow ever closer.
