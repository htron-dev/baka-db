## Sinopse

The first story is like 'Highlander Immortals Gone Yaoi' but not exactly, because there can be more than one and cutting off the head will NOT stop them! Will anything?! There sure is lots of penetration going on, and these boys aren't shy about doing it with swords either. (That double-meaning is not a joke.)

The second story is about ninja-boy training. Those boys train hard. Long and hard.

The third, fourth and fifth chapter is a story called Birds of Wing Abreast. It starts when a woman takes a small child and leaves her... husband? Taiki is now a heart-broken cute young med student. A man notices him, which was predictable! The man is a tattoo artist who seems to have psychic visions, which was unpredictable? Can you predict what happens? Fine, but can you predict EVERYTHING that happens?
