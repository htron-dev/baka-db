    "sinopse": "Chitose Morishige is a 12-year-old seventh-grader with no friend in the world. Her father, Professor Morishige, builds a robot companion for his daughter to ease her loneliness.\n\nThe only problem is that Ichika Robata, the android, is built much too lifelike that Chitose believes she's a normal human girl who either ran away or was kidnapped by her father. Ichika attempts repeatedly to prove that she's a real robot, with hilariously disastrous results.",
