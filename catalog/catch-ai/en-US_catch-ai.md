## Sinopse

Campus comedies weren't always the leading plot of shoujo manga. The old shoujo manga used to focus on personal accomplishments, or becoming somebody. "Catch, Love" is about a girl who picks up a camera someday and realizes that she wants to be a photographer, like her father once was. She starts working for a magazine, meeting some celebrities and taking photos of them. But those old ladies chastise the girl because she falls short to emulating the great photographer, her father. She aims to perfect her skills and win compliments from those who loved her father's work... And of course, she receives a lot of support from her friends and the love of her life. A lonely heroine can't make a good story! (Source: Esthétique)
