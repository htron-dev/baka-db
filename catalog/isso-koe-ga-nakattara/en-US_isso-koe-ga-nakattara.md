## Sinopse

Rokuse, a janitor who struggles with stuttering, meets Takashina. Takashina is a man who is able to skillfully present himself in front of large crowds of people, which earns him the admiration of Rokuse. While Rokuse nurses a growing love for Takashina, he stutters out a "Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-That's o-o-okay!" to Takashina's offer. What will you do with a top-notch employee and a stuttering janitor? Their story is bound to be rife with communication hurdles.
