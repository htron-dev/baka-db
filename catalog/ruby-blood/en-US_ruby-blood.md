## Sinopse

Meet little Lulu - a vampire girl in whose right eye flashes crimson sparks, and the giant Gau.

There are three places in the human world that made them who they are now - “the school,” “the church” and “the hospital.” What happened to Lulu when she was still human and how did she become what she is now?
