## Sinopse

"When his sharp fangs touched the nape of my neck, I felt shocking senses arouse inside of me."

The destined meeting between Yoo Da-in, a guy often mistaken as a girl because of his beauty and Seo Kang-hoo, a handsome hunk that even guys would fall for. Yoo Da-in is b.i.t.t.e.n. by Seo Kang-hoo, causing his heart to stop.
