## Sinopse

In the multiverse called the data world, everything corresponding to the real world is stored. Within it, the data from relics of human culture gained self-awareness, and a secret group of spirits established an alliance: The Country of Rare Treasure.
The restorers, while investigating their own origins, lead the secret spirits against the forgotten viruses that will devour everything.
