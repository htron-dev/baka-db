## Sinopse

After losing his life as a soccer player to an accident, Shougo Hinata works at a patisserie run by his benefactor and long-time crush, Akira Hanagiri. Unable to convey his feelings, he thinks that being by the side of calm and gentle Akira is enough—until one day, he witnesses Akira fighting on the streets in the middle of the night like a completely different person. After his true character is revealed, Akira attempts to avoid Shougo. "I want to know the things I don't know about you!" "I don’t want things to remain the same!" With these revelations, Shougo pushes Akira down...?! "What should I do, Akira-san? I want to make love to you no matter what." A story about a determined love, featuring a hot-blooded, pure-hearted young man and an ex-gangster patissier.
