## Sinopse

Sugiyama is madly in love with Akihisa, though he's never confessed to the hot-tempered megane who thinks he's a pervert. When he finally works up the courage he confesses to the wrong twin! Hedonistic Akinori has no problem being his brother's substitute, but will it be enough for Sugiyama?
