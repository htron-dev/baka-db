## Sinopse

Yuu, who grew up in Akita, loves his step-cousin Hatahiko! Yuu, who moves to Tokyo for university, has a coincidental and fateful (?) reunion with Hatahiko. When strange things happen, Yuu temporarily starts the "life living together" of his dreams. However, to Yuu who's on cloud nine cohabitating with his first love, Hatahiko, while smiling, says, "I'm not interested in younger people." A handsome salaryman who's a bit of a bully X a coddled university student's pure love life together.
