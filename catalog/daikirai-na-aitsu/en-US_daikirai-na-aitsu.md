## Sinopse

Chihiro Kouzuki is a stage actor and works part-time as a housekeeper to earn more money. His uncle called him about taking on a housekeeping job for Aoki, an elite businessman who lives in an expensive condo. Chihiro accepts, not realizing how demanding Aoki can be about how he wants his condo tidied up.

He is so demanding that Chihiro is starting to lose his patience with him...
