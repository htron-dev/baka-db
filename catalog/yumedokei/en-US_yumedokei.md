## Sinopse

Mutsumi is beginning her new life in Sutsuji Gadai, New Town. Unfortunately, as her mother's popularity as manga artist compels her to change cities every year, Mutsumi has experienced a lot of "new life"s, and not very much living.

A new elementary school means a new class, new students... how will Mutsumi deal with all of this, and her father's attempts to get custody?
