    "sinopse": "A heated battle is once again revving up at Basara Academy between baseball star Masamune Date and soccer ace Yukimura Sanada. What's more, ever since student council chairman Hideyoshi Toyotomi received a suspension, leaving the seat up for grabs, a host of class \"warlords\" have become embroiled in a quest for supreme power. Amid Ieyasu Tokugawa's appeals to bonds of kinship and Mitsunari Ishida's fervor to defeat him, who will wrest ultimate control of the domain in \"troubled\" times?\n\n(Source: TBS Global Business)",
