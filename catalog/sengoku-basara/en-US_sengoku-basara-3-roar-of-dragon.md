## Sinopse

A manga based on the Sengoku Basara 3 action video game. The main characters, Date Masamune and Sanada Yukimura are two warlords who are both attempting to conquer all of the land. Almost greater than their desire to conquer, though, is their desire to fight each other in single combat.
