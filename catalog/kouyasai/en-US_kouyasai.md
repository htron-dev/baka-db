## Sinopse

Journeying through the 18 islands and gathering the scattered tales is my job as a storyteller.

During every Winter solstice we gather around the island master's keep, sharing our tales until dawn, this is known as Koyasai, the yearly festival for story tellers!

Let me share a dark, hidden tale with you, a story about the dreadful monster... This year, near the abandoned island master's keep, the Koyasai that only belongs to the two of us is about to begin!
