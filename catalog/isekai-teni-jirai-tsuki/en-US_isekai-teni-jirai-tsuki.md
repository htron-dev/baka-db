## Sinopse

In a world without cheats, a cultivation chronicle of wisdom and schemes. Among the students that were sent to another world were three childhood friends: Nao, Toya, and Haruka, who act to find equilibrium and create for themselves a peaceful place of living in the severe environment of a medieval-styled world. Whether it be mutual cooperation in monster subjugation or collection quests, there are no thoughts to become a hero.
