## Sinopse

We struggle to live because we have hope. We try our best to be happy because there is someone whom we should protect. We believe in tomorrow and walk forward because there is a person in the far off distance. An older brother and younger sister who spend their days waiting for their beloved mother. A checkered fate suddenly visits the older brother, who is thinking of his sister. In the middle of a downpour of rain, the "story" begins.
