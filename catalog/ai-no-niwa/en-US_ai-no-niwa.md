After being sexually assaulted by his classmates, Kiyo has stayed home from school for several days. While taking a walk, by chance he stumbles upon the residence of Takami, a novelist. Feeling safe in the man's presence, he comes to spend his summer there. Even while thinking it strange how carefully he is being treated and how oddly affectionate Takami is, Kiyo can’t help but falling for Takami more and more. Then one day, he finds out that Takami writes erotic novels, and his feelings toward the man start to change...
