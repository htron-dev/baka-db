## Sinopse

A polite and lethargic boy was reincarnated in another world as a vampire bishoujo. In this world of swords and magic, this protagonist who was reborn replete with all kinds of cheat powers was searching for one thing――!

"Three meals a day, snacks and an afternoon nap, I guess."

And thus begins the fantasy comedy of a vampire looking for the ideal moocher lifestyle…?
