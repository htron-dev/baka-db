    "sinopse": "Jinzo Hatta was picked up from the side of the road by Shizuichiro Yanagi, who runs a small kendo dojo. Living with Master Yanagi, who seems stubborn and has an unexpectedly childish side, Jinzo finds himself being physically drawn to him. The budding love becomes uncontrollable and so one night Jinzo secretly kisses Yanagi while he is sleeping.\n\nOne day, a big request came to Yanagi to teach swordsmanship at a samurai's residence. Yangi is reluctant and has conflicting feelings, as Jinzo wishes to please him and help him progress in his career but does not know that that is not of great importance to him. Then one night, as the two conversed, Yanagi became drunk and lustfully propositioned Jinzo to lie with him and let natural instincts guide them. The next morning, Yanagi, who has a backache, makes an unexpected proposal to Jinzo!?\n\n(Source: Houbunsha, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Ashimoto ni Koi ga Aru",
