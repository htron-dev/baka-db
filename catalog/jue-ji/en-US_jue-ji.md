## Sinopse

The Odin Mainland is separated into four countries, in each lives a group of soul masters protecting their county with their soul powers. The most powerful seven of them are known as Noble Lords. The story begins in the water origin, the Aslan Empire.

Qi Ling has been a busboy in an inn since young and subconsciously tamed a legendary soul beast, Ice Fang in a battle between soul masters. Yin Chen (Kris Wu) came on orders of the Silver Priest to take him in as his disciple. With his help, Qi Ling heads to the Grave of the Souls to seek his soul weapon, yet as he couldn’t sit still like how his lord instructed him; he enters the Grave of the Souls with Tianshu You Hua and Guishan Lian Quan. Qi Ling thus become embroiled in the upcoming storm; a battle of soul powers between the lords.

At the very same time, another conspiracy that has long been in the works within the Aslan Empire is gradually revealing itself. While searching for Qi Ling, Yin Chen found out that his master, the former 1st lord Gilgamesh may still be living, and thus risked his everything to began the search of his previous master. At the same time, the killing lords You Ming and Thalia received the silver priest's orders to kill Guishan Lian Quan and her brother, Guishen Feng Hun. A battle between the lords and disciples, in a fight for truth and honor, thus ensues.
