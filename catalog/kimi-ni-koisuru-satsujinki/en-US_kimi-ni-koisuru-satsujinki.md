## Sinopse

Suzuki Ryuto is an introverted, timid college student. Every day he puts on a fame smile, trying his best to blend into a group of outgoing students even despite cruel teasing over his virginity. One day he comes to a drinking party where he meets a beautiful girl, Kokoa. Per her request, he pretends to be her boyfriend to ward off the stalker who has been harassing the gilt. That tender love was the beginning of a great tragedy...
