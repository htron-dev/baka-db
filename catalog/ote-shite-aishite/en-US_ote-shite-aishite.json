    "sinopse": "Office worker Momose keeps his being an otaku a secret and tries to lead his daily life as inconspicuously as possible. As his new colleague Sadamura is introduced to him one day, he is in for the shock of a lifetime: Sadamura had been the boy who protected him from being bullied by other children, but wanted Momose to be his \"dog\" that did everything for him in exchange! Just as Momose is racking his brain on how to deal with this unwelcome reunion, both of them are put in the same group for a project!\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)",
