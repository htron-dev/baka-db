## Sinopse

Reiji Sawa, a famous model, has insomnia due to heartbreak and seeks different partners to sleep with. To avoid any bad rumors about his habit, his company has sent a new model, Towa, to be his bed/sleeping partner. They were ordered to live together, so Reiji reluctantly agreed to the arrangement. Upon arriving at the house, Towa suddenly "forces" himself onto Reiji...?!
