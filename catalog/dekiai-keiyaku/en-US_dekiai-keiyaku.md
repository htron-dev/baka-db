## Sinopse

Masato, who has a mysterious skill (?!) of making men fall in love with him, ends up getting fired from his modeling job because of that very skill. When he's at his wit's end, he gets a job from Kuramoto, the capable heir of an apparel maker. However, one of the conditions is to be his lover by contract?! Drastic love between a super darling heir and a complicated model!
