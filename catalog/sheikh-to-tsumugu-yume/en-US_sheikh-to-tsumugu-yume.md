This story takes place on a small heart shaped island known as Litole Land. The kind-hearted True, who devotes her life to caring for war orphans, has met and fallen in love with Sheik Falfarhk, prince of the desert, who has visited Litole Land under disguise. The Sheik proposes to True suddenly, and it seems the proposition is for a political marriage in order to protect the countries' resources. "If only you were not a prince and wanted me just for love." What will happen to these lovers from such different worlds?!
