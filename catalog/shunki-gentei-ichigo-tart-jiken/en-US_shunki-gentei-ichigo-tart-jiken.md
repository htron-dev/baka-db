## Sinopse

Kobato Jougorou is a boy who wants to improve his habit of deductive reasoning and over-analyzing everything; Asanai Yuki is a girl who is avoided by others because of her strange tendencies. Both of them desire nothing more than to have a simple and peaceful high school life. This is a story about two people who are aiming and working together to be inconspicuous citizens.
