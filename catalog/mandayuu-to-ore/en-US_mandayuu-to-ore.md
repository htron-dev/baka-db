## Sinopse

1. Mandayuu and Me : Kyohei is a serious, responsible office worker while his friend, Mandayuu, is anything but. A talented, high-strung, and perpetually horny hentai artist, Mandayuu is always getting Kyohei mixed up in his hare-brained exploits.

Whether it's posing for Mandayuu's comics or getting trampled by rabid fans at an anime convention, life with Mandayuu around is many things, but it's certainly never boring!

2. Mandayuu and Me - The Comic Bastard

3-5) Take That ! My Love - Kyouhei's Love Trance (3 chapters)

6. Mandayuu and Me - New Year's Eve

7. Tell Me the Price of Love (Kissa Kisara e Youkoso)

(from B-U)
