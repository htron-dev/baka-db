## Sinopse

Minami is a young actor who has been cast as the main character of a superhero TV program. Although he takes the job half-heartedly, thinking of it as a mere children's show, he's soon taken by the talent of his costar, Sawada. One day, Minami stumbles upon Sawada kissing a man! Deeply confused, he's unable to hide his growing attraction for him... A hero's love is always filled with trials!
