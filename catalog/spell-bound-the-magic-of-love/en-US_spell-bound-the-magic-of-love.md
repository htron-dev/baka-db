## Sinopse

Ami is your typical Japanese teenager; hip, stylish and more into music, fashion and boys than school and her part-time job. She'd rather spend her afternoon skating, jamming and shopping than studying. But unlike most other teens, Ami also has a secret life. She's a practicing witch! Once given a powerful magic book, Ami has secretly been training in the mystic arts of magic. However, her intentions are not always the most noble as at times she likes to test her spells (and sense of humor) on her friends and cause a little mischief at their expense. However, Ami has yet to master the all important spell of love and win the heart of Hiro, her childhood friend and secret object of affection. But unbeknownst to Ami, Hiro has fallen for the charms of Nicole, the beautiful blonde foreigner who has been hanging around their local haunts recently. What is her interest in Hiro and how will all this affect Ami?

(Synopsis: Fanboy Entertainment press release.)
