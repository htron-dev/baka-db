## Sinopse

Rakko Umi e Kaeru!
Among the world's most powerful otters is Rakko 9-gou, the abandoned and forgotten "Lost Number" who seeks vengeance on the human race. Rakko 11-gou attempts to foil the plans of his adversary, but his "Olivine Tholeiite" attack has no effect on Rakko 11-gou's tail of carbon nanotubes! Can Rie and Naho make it in time to save Rakko 11-gou?

Reversi PV
This is the vigorous theme song that begins each episode of Reversi, a gripping anime about Schwarz, a demon of darkness; and Weiss, a demon of light.
