Rakko 11-gou attempts to foil the plans of his adversary, but his \"Olivine Tholeiite\" attack has no effect on Rakko 11-gou's tail of carbon nanotubes! Can Rie and Naho make it in time to save Rakko 11-gou?\n\nReversi PV\nThis is the vigorous theme song that begins each episode of Reversi, a gripping anime about Schwarz, a demon of darkness; and Weiss, a demon of light.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
