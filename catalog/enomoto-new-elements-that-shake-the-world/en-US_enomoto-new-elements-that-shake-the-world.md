## Sinopse

Enomoto: New Elements that Shake the World is a manga written and drawn by Shunji Enomoto. It appeared in Kodansha's Weekly Morning from 1997 to 2003 and has been gathered into nine book collections. It is filled with extreme scatological and sexual humor on a gargantuan scale. The series centers on the exploits of the shameless and irresponsible salaryman Gosuke Maeda, his equally unhinged preadolescent son Michiro, and various depraved co-workers, including the obsessive voyeur and exhibitionist Tamura and the unsmiling closet dominatrix Kuzuhara.
