## Sinopse

"Eternal life means... that I will not be given for all eternity. I don't want anything anymore. I only want one thing, a story with an end."

An organisation has been targeting this one soul for nearly eight hundred years. This soul exists in a lizard who has been cursed with immortality. By implanting its soul into a dead body, Tokage will rise again.

While many desire eternal life, this soul does not want to continue to suffer. With an organisation aimed at protecting spiritual order, how does Tokage plan to escape its perpetual burden?
