## Sinopse

He was my lover in High school, my beautiful, malicious Shinobu-sempai. He was also the one who took away everything, whether it was my first kiss, or my first time. Then, after the graduation ceremony, he completely disappeared. Four years have passed since then, and right when I thought I’d already forgotten all memories about him, he suddenly appeared in front of my eyes, more beautiful and charming than ever… Now, even though he’s willing to open his body for everyone, the only thing he gives me is his cruel words. But no matter what, I still want to be by his side… So I started working a part-time job at the bar where he’s working… (Source: M-U)

This volume includes the three-part title story as well as the three shorter stories "Let's Forget", "Freedom From Constraint", and "Stirring Technique".
