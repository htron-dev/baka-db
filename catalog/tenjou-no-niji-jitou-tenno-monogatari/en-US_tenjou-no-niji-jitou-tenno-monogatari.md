## Sinopse

Prince Naka-no-Ooe showed his interest in the talent and beauty of Nukata. He then offered Prince Ooama his daughter for marriage, in exchange for Nukata. Prince Ooama was in agony as he was devoted to his brother but in the mean time, he loved Nukata. In the end, he chose to let go of Nukata as a gesture of loyalty to his brother, however heartbroken. This was the beginning of the long and epic series of Tenjou no Niji, in which Uno-Sarara-no-Himemiko, Prince Ooama's then young bride, would become his ally in succeeding the throne and later made herself Jitou Tenno (Empress Jitou).
