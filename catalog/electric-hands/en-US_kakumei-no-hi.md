## Sinopse

Meet Megumi! She's petite, adorable, and a total eye-catcher. In fact, she reminds almost everyone at school of the very elite (and very missing) boy student Kei Yoshikawa. Whispers and wild rumors begin to run riot from the hallways to the exclusive school rooftop...and the most powerful clique on campus has their sights set on sweet Megumi, too. Can her good friend Makoto shield her from a showdown and help her "skirt" the issue? Are some secrets just too big to keep?
