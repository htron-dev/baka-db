He thought they had all disappeared but at the beginning of Juniour High he has another one, and it shows him having sex with another man!\n\nTamura refuses to become gay and swears to prevent it. When he sees Seiwa, he realizes that this is the other man in his (now frequent) dreams!\n\nSo Tamura treats Seiwa quite badly in hopes that he will leave him alone, however, Seiwa has other plans. What will happen between these two?\n\nThere are several side stories in the anthology Aruji no Oose no Mama ni.\n\n(Source: Cidsa's Scanlations)",
