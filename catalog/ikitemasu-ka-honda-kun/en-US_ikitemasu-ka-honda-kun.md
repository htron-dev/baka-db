## Sinopse

The manga centers on air-headed girl Arisu, who one day receives a confession of love from Honda. However, the world has been taken over by zombies, so it may not be the right time for romance. Arisu tries to live happily in a zombie-filled world, while Honda holds some secrets of his own. Together, the two try to survive in this new world.
