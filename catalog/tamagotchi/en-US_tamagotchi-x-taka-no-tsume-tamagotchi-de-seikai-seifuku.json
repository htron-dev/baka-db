The episode was on the DVD bundled with the October 2012 issue of the shoujo manga magazine Ciao.\n\nThe episode features the Eagle Talon cast attempting to recruit girls into their organization by understanding the successful marketing of Tamagotchi!, specifically the newest season Tamagotchi! Yume Kira Dream (the character goods featured were real items people could purchase). They try to make cute character goods of themselves but fail miserably since Eagle Talon is full of un-cute men.",
