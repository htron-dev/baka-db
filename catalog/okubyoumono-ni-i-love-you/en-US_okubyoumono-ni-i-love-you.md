## Sinopse

Due to his scary face, Shougo has been alone since entering university. But unexpected events lead him to become close with Hina, from the same university. Shougo, elated at the fact he's become friends with the cool and kind Hina, finds out that Hina breaks out into hives when people treat him with affection—a "love allergy"?!
