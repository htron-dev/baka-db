Our heroine, the daughter of an earl, signed herself away in a marriage contract to an aloof duke, Cersis, in order to save her family from a lifetime of poverty. All of a sudden, Viola's life is turned upside down when she moves into the Fisaris family's manor and is left to negotiate her new life as a \"show wife\" in a world she had only ever caught glimpses of before. How will she shake things up at the Fisaris estate?\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",
