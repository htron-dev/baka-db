## Sinopse

Tattoo artist Hyakkei received an unusual request— His childhood friend, Kaoru, next in line to succeed his yakuza clan, asks him to tattoo a dragon on his back. Kaoru, who hasn’t changed since that time many years ago, is still as strong-willed. With skin of pure white, he warmly shook Hyakkei’s heart. The memory of their summer as 18 year-olds reawaken at their reunion. Tattooist x Yakuza pure love story!
