## Sinopse

Yamanouchi Kouya is a famous author's daughter, who is a shy young girl just starting middle school. She is named class representative along with Kannatsuki Yuuya, a boy she met on her way to school who frightens her a little bit. They are trying to work together, but he always seems mad at her and she is painfully shy. The thing is, Yuuya knows something that Kouya doesn't know yet—that her famous father is going to marry his mother!
