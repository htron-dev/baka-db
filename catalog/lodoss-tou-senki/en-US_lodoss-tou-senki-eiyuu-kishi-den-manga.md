## Sinopse

Five years ago, a band of six adventurers defeated the conquering armies of Marmo, the dark island, and saved the accursed island, Lodoss. Since that day, the survivors have been honored as heroes, and their deeds have become legends. But the evil never perished...it retreated, waited and schemed. Now, the Black Knight of Marmo has returned to threaten the accursed island once more. Old heroes must heed the call to defend their homeland and new heroes are forged as the battle for Lodoss begins anew...
