## Sinopse

"I probably fell in love a long time ago."

Seven years ago, Atsushi locked his childhood friend, Kouichi, in a warehouse. After that, Kouichi developed a fear of dark places. Atsushi, who is tormented every day with the knowledge of his crime, is pushed down by Kouichi one day, who says, "If you're sorry, let's do it."

When you're forcing your love on someone, is it because you're yearning for the other person's heart?
