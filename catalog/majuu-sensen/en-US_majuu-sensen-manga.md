A secret society of scientists seek to create advanced humanoid lifeforms through the hybrid of man and beast for their almighty Lord Yeshu and the new world that is nigh.

From Ken Ishikawa, creator of Getter Robo and Kyomu Senki, is a tale of biblic myth, violent patricide and monstrous demonbeasts. This is Majuu Sensen, the Demonbeast Warfront!
