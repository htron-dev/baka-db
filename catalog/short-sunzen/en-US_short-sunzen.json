    "sinopse": "Satsuki Kurokawa is a rather rough and tumble high school senior who acts more like a gang member than a young lady. Along with her best friend, Aya Sendo, she attends Tama High, a school feared more for its ability to produce top fighters and delinquents than its ability to churn out graduates. Though they're often misunderstood as never-do-well's by the outside world, the biggest misunderstanding is between the two of them. You see, Aya is totally head over heels in love with Satsuki, and she has no clue! Will Aya ever be able to confess his love?\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
