## Sinopse

Vere Tolladine, a successful businessman, needed help. He'd been taking care of his late brother's wife and her children and couldn't keep doing it alone. So Fabienne became his live-in nanny. Vere is unfailingly kind to everyone... except Fabienne! She can't understand why Vere treats her differently, but she can't stop thinking about him. Fabienne has conflicting feelings about Vere that become even more complicated when she realizes that Vere is in love with his sister-in-law...
