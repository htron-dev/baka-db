## Sinopse

When his senpai breaks a leg, Serizawa agrees to sub for him at the design firm. He doesn't expect to see Ikuta, a face from his past. Though Ikuta seems as gentle and kind as ever, he doesn't remember Serizawa. But outside of work Ikuta's personality is strikingly different. Is it really the same person, or did Serizawa never know the real Ikuta?
