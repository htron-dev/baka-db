## Sinopse

Katsura, a second year in his high school's archery club, has a hard time controlling his nerves. His "secret weapon" is his brother's best friend and childhood buddy, Sou! One hug from Sou and Katsura's nerves are soothed to a peaceful calm. But he can't keep Sou around him forever. As he wonders how he'll survive without Sou's hugs, his friend Kouichi suddenly asks if he can be the one to save him, and kisses him! What now?!
