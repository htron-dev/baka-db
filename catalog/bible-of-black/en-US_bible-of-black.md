## Sinopse

The world's most infamous villains are being murdered one after another, in what is called the "Judge's Incident." A mark is left at each and every crime scene. And then, the balance tips to one side, little by little. What is the reason behind the continuing paranormal occurrences, and what is the true nature of Shouya, the boy connected to each incident?
