## Sinopse

Though she's a tomboy with a hangup over her tiny chest, Iori has a crush on Sota Seto, who is the pastry chef at the cafe where she works. Iori was sure that he wasn't interested in her until one day, he suddenly professes his love for her and goes on to kiss her. She sees him unclothed for the first time—and my, he's huge!! She never would have expected the graceful man's lips to be caressing her all over. It's terribly embarrassing, but she discovers that his you-know-what isn't gross at all...
