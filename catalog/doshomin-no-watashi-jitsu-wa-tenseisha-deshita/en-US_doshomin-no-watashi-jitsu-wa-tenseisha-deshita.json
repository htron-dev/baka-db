    "sinopse": "I, Fiara, was born to a commoner father and a mother of noble status. From a young age, I was treated as a maid, while my mother only doted on my younger sister. No matter how hard I worked, I was not allowed to advance in my studies either.\n\n\"If so, I should just leave such a family...!!\"\n\nAfter running away from home, on my way to the royal capital, I met a magic user, Zack, who changed my entire life.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
