## Sinopse

I, Fiara, was born to a commoner father and a mother of noble status. From a young age, I was treated as a maid, while my mother only doted on my younger sister. No matter how hard I worked, I was not allowed to advance in my studies either.

"If so, I should just leave such a family...!!"

After running away from home, on my way to the royal capital, I met a magic user, Zack, who changed my entire life.
