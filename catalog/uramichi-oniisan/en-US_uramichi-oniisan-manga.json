    "sinopse": "Uramichi Omota is a 31-year-old man who works as a gymnastics instructor for \"Together with Mama,\" an educational show for kids. In front of his young audience, he has to display a happy-go-lucky and energetic demeanor. Outside of his job and sometimes even in front of the cameras, he cannot help but slip back into his true personality, which is the opposite of his TV counterpart. In truth, he is miserable and fed-up with his current lifestyle.\n\nUramichi Oniisan is a dark comedy that reveals the not-so-bright reality of adulthood using its characters as unfortunate examples.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
