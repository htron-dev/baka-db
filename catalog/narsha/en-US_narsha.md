The year is 387 in Gogeuryuh, city of Yodong where there is much conflict between two nations. Lately Hoo yun soldiers (the enemy nation) have been harassing the citizens in the outskirts of Gogeuryuh. A faithful young Prince of Gogeuryuh, Prince Dam Duk, is outraged and therefore saves his people by wielding his sword, but by doing so he loses his title of prince, and becomes a wanted fugitive of his nation!
