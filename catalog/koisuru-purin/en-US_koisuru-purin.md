## Sinopse

My name is Rina Uchida, a thirteen-year-old girl. As my parents live overseas due to my father's transfer, I stay with our distant relative Yoshikawa family. In the family are twin brothers, Naoya and Yuuya. Naoya is unfriendly but Yuuya who is my type is very nice. However, there is weird creature Bucket Purin in the family...!?
