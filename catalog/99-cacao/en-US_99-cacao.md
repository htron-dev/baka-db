Sayu, a newbie when it comes to love, fell in love with the number one cold-hearted prince in school, Kanna...?!

This is a compilation of three chapters of the popular series "99% Cacao" and "Yellow-eyed Fish," based on the original work by Satou Takako.

Chocolate and tests are best when sweet! Also, if possible, love, too...
