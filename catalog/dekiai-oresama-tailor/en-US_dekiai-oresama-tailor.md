## Sinopse

Girls are greedy when it's about love and being smart-dressed! Kurisu Maiko wanted to become a designer. But she failed at the entrance exam.
But a high school student, the genius Shigamiya Iou recognizes Maiko's abilities and bought her pattern. Then, he tried his best to let her become the next best designer of their generation. But there's also a second genius who met Maiko, Tachibanaou Hato.

Will the three of them succeed in both love and dreams...?
