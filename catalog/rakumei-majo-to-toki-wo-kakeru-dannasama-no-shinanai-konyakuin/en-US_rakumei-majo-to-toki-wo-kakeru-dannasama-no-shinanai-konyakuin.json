    "sinopse": "Michela August is an aspiring young witch who should have had a promising future, save for one fact—every one of her attempts at magic leads to a catastrophic explosion. Time and again, she fails to complete even the simplest of spells, yet she refuses to give up on her dream.\n\nOne day, she is saved from one of her own misfired spells by a young man named Eusius. He claims to be from the future and comes with shocking news: Michela will die at the young age of 18. The Michela of his time was unwilling to give up on becoming a witch, leading to an accident that left her bereft of magic itself. Then, her body deteriorated until she finally died. Carrying with him a skull and the sole desire to prevent Michela's fate, Eusius leapt through time, betting everything on the chance to save her, his wife.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
