## Sinopse

A very amusing story about a 23 year old OL named Rumiko. Her parents have been pressuring her into letting them set up an omiai, or a meeting for an arranged marriage for her. They have several possible candidates she could choose from. Rumiko is not interested. She has her sights set on a guy at her work. However, when her romantic dreams with her coworker do not turn out as she planned, she agrees to meet whoever her parents choose for the omiai. They introduce her to Kenya OOTSUKI. He is handsome and friendly, but their meeting doesn't go very well, and Rumiko refuses to marry him. Imagine her surprise at work when she is introduced to her new co-worker- Kenya! He has been hired at her company and is a successful employee. Rumiko and Kenya are thrown together more often, and a relationship starts to grow. But will a relationship based on an arranged meeting last? There is a random one-shot story about phone sex at the end of the volume. :D
