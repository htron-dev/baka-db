## Sinopse

Shiho, Cocoa and Himeka are three sisters who live together with their protective older brother. As their parents are off traveling the world, the brother has taken on the parental role as well as taking point in the bakery that all the siblings operate. As a result, the brother has developed a sister complex, becoming, at times, overbearing to Shiho, Cocoa and Himeka. This is a comedic story about their little weird family.
