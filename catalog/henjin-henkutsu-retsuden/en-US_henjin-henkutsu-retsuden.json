    "sinopse": "This title explores the lives of several famous eccentrics and bizarre personages. From exceedingly violent baseball great Ty Cobb; to the mystery Lady Winchester who believed non-stop and nonsensical building of her house would protect her from vengeful spirits; the healthy but deadly infectious Typhoid Mary; bizarre and fickle 70's promoter Kou Yoshio; and the misunderstood, neurotic electricity great Nikola Tesla.
