## Sinopse

Akira has just ran away from home; Lying face-down on the floor, out in the pouring rain. By chance, a guy walked by and accidentally stepped on Akira's hand. The guy took Akira to his apartment, and they end up sleeping with each other. But after dropping akira off, he announces he wants nothing to do with Akira. What will akira do after this? Also to add, Akira's over-worrying friend Takumi who also likes Akira, and a teacher who'd threatened to do something to Akira's friend if akira doesn't give him what he wants...
(from B-U)
