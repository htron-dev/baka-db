## Sinopse

Ogawa Tomoo, a high school boy, can not figure out why his classmate, Oomori Yuka, likes him so much. Unlike him, she's friendly, upbeat, excels at sports and is one of the most popular students in the school. Tomoo doesn’t understand why someone so attractive would be interested in someone like himself. He decides to push Yuka away for her own good but her persistence eventually pays off and he can not help but be attracted to her.
