## Sinopse

17-year-old Ringo Kinoshita falls in love at first sight with student teacher Shachi Kaiya but where are the rose colored days of his first love? Unrequited love is bad enough but it seems like Kaiya-sensei can't stand him at all. With a prank gone wrong and a series of misunderstandings just how will these two come together or will they just be driven further apart?
