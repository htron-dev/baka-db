## Sinopse

To find her missing father, Tachibana Izumi goes to search for him at the Mankai Company Theatre he once worked at as the director. What she finds there, however, is the theatre group burdened with a huge sum of debt, just one young actor, and no success worthy of mention. To save the theatre group her father had loved so dearly, Izumi has to become the new director and re-establish the four troupes: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter; and lead the theatre group to success.

This manga follows the story of the first troupe, the Spring Troupe (Haru-gumi).
