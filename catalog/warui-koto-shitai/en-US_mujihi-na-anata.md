## Sinopse

Aikawa Kuon and Shirahane Nanao are now officially a couple; but someone from Nanao's past has appeared... Who is that person? and why did Nanao wake up all sweaty the day after meeting him? not to mention, what impact will this incident have on the couple? A lot more steamy action is included in this series than in its prequel.
