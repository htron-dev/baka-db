## Sinopse

I'm Kurahashi Futaba and I'm currently looking for a boyfriend... That boy should be 'A person who can take care of himself!' kind of person. I hope I could find my ideal boyfriend soon, but I'm stuck in a complicated relationship: me, my childhood friend whom I see as my little brother, and the no.1 playboy in the school...

This is a chaotic series of events of the three in developing a love story!
