    "sinopse": "Stahn Aileron was a typical country-boy looking to become a great adventurer, until he stowed away on an airship that got attacked by monsters. Searching for a weapon to defend himself with, he discovers in the ship's cargo area a magical sentient blade, a 'Swordian', named Dymlos that only he can seem to hear the voice of. In this chance meeting, Stahn is thrust into a quest revolving around the missing 'Eye of God', teaming up with other 'Swordian Masters' to travel the world and chase down the thieves.",
