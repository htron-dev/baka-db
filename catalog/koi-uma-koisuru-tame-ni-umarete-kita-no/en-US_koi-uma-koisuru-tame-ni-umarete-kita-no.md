## Sinopse

Shiina is a daughter of a man, who used to manage his own company as president. As her father went bankrupt, she lost her house, and her engagement was broken off. The only thing left for her is a club that was left in her name. Having no idea of how the club is, she visits it, and manager Ryuichiro comes to meet her. She soon finds out this club might be far more than a girl brought up in high society can handle!
