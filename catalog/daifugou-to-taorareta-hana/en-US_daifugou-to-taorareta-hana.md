## Sinopse

The Belair family's acting skills are famous worldwide, but Lucilla Belair has a problem. She thought it would only be natural for her to pick a career in acting, since she grew up in Hollywood, but she's lost one audition after another. Panicking, she decides she'll go to any length to get the role of her dreams, so she breaks into the hotel room of a famous director! But the man she meets there isn't the director at all... Lucilla wants to run away, but she's too intrigued by this stranger. It's as if he can see right through her...
