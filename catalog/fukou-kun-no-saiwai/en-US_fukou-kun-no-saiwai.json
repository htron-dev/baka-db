    "sinopse": "Touri knows he's unlucky, and that's why he lives humbly and quietly without friends. The only things that make him happy are games, social media, and Hiro, his big brother-like childhood friend. Hiro told him about some forbidden \"rituals\" to turn your luck around, which led to a physical relationship between the two. Touri finds joy and comfort in these acts, but one day, Ryouma, a good-looking, happy-go-lucky guy, transfers into Touri's class. He's so different that he frustrates Touri, who decides to just ignore him, but Ryouma approaches Touri anyway. This is the story of a super unlucky guy and his lucky classmate in pursuit of their happily ever after!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
