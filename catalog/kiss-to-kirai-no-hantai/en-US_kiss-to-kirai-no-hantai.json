    "sinopse": "Are the two of us friends, or are we lovers? It's not clear how he regards us. If I say, \"let's kiss,\" he'll kiss me. If I say, \"let's move in together,\" he'll smoothly accept. He'll indulge me, but he won't express a desire for anything in return. Just when we've moved into our new place, his little brother who loathes me appears.\n\nBecause it's a good opportunity, he wants to keep tabs on us. If it comes down to me or his family, he'll choose me...right?\n\n(Source: Nakama)",
