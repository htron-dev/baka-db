## Sinopse

Ryou, a junior high school student, lives alone. She cooks well and builds warm relations with everyone through her cuisine. There will be 4-frames full of minute and accurate depictions of cooking and cuisine, as well as appetizing dining scenes, with tantalizing eroticism during meal time.

When lonely, why not eat rice and be warm together?
