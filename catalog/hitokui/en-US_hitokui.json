Trainee doctor Sasaki finds himself in the midst of one of these mass death events. He must now fight his way out of a dungeon ruled by a man-eating monster: \"Hitokui.\" As other humans are slaughtered and eaten alive around him, will he be able to escape out of this dungeon and bring an end to these mass murders?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
