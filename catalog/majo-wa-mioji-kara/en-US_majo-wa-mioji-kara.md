## Sinopse

Once, Kurokawa Mikage was the fearful "Witch of Moonlight," but now, 300 years later, she's just an office lady who is teased by her co-workers for still being single. Mikage thinks she's fine with her ultimate spinster life, posting fake photos of a pretend-relationship…until the young and handsome Kobayashi Satoru joins her company! Is this the start of a real, bewitching romance at last!?
