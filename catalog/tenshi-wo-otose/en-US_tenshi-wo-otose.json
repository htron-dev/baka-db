Pure Love, Honest Boy - High-schooler Miyoshi Takechi may be the only person in the world who doesn't know about \"those\" kind of massage parlors! An advertisement in a magazine picturing the beautiful Kazuma compels the nerdy student to visit. Though he left abruptly, Takechi is pursued by Kazuma.\n\n5. Use of Magic - Segou Tasuka has always been a bit useless. Never smart enough or strong enough to surpass his older brother. Tasuka lives alone, and when he father hires Toudou Yuugiri to serves as his caretaker, Tasuka's not interested. But Yuugiri's not giving up! He knows Tasuka can be the best and he's going to help.\n\n6. Angel's Rest? - A look at Tamaki from Mitsumoto's point of view.\n\n(Source : MangaFox)",
