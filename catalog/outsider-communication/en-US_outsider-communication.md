## Sinopse

Seki, who hangs out with the slacker students at his high school, is discovered working part-time by the elite student Iwashiro. Despite not knowing each other, they fight, and while Seki is trying to get rid of him, he accidentally makes Iwashiro fall down the stairs. Having sprained his ankle, Iwashiro forces Seki to help him. What will happen when these two with completely different personalities start spending time together?
