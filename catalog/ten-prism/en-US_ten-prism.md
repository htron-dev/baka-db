## Sinopse

The story revolves around Tsunashi, the child of royalty who was left behind in the lost kingdom of Karan. He is expected by those around him to awaken his great powers that sleep within him in order to revive the kingdom—but rather than fighting, Tsunashi enjoys playing in the world of books. However, he must become serious soon, as a new army is threatening to invade Karan.
