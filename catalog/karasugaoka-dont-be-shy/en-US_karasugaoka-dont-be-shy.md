## Sinopse

In the town of Karasugaoka, two voluntary groups have been formed to prevent crimes: "VOICE" and "Karasukai," in charge of the east and west areas respectively. The groups' leaders, Sou Izuhara and Shinba Tetsuji, are unable to get along with each other, winding up in arguments every time they meet. In reality, Sou deeply admires Shinba, having been rescued by him in his youth; however, embarrassed by his feelings, Sou ends up throwing insults at Shinba instead.

As the two crime fighters continue aiding their community, will Sou be able to muster up the courage to confess his true feelings to Shinba?
