## Sinopse

Chiharu and Maki have worked at the same company together for three years. They were both unceremoniously dumped this spring. As they were drowning their sorrows with sake, they were both summoned to another world. They were given the very simple job of cleansing miasma. Well, there's no way around it. Thus they begin their quest for alcohol, delicious food, and if possible, a faithful boyfriend.
