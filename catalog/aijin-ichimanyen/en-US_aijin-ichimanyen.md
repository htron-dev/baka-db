## Sinopse

A homeless boy is taken in one night by a stranger, but this stranger doesn't give charity. So, what does he want? Sex--and lots of it.
Can our homeless hero handle his new master's libido? What will he do now that his master wants to sell him? What about his master's horny younger brother? And most importantly of all, what the heck are their names?! (Source: DramaQueen)
