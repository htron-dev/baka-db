Even in sickness and in health, you bet they'll be smiling happily (and getting in their sexy time)! How do these two normal guys face the countless problems ahead and continue to spend their lives together? At the end awaits their future as a couple! A day in the life of a gay couple living together!\n\n(Source: Nihonbungeisha, translated)",
