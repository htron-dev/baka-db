## Sinopse

There’s something for everyone in Koshino's first collection, My Neighbor: Inumaru was perfectly (un)happy working as a convenience store manager, so when Sakura literally drops in on him, he’s exposed to a whole new world – one he's certainly not used to. How will this change his perspective? For 10 years Kawabata held sweet memories of his first love, Nishijima...until they end up trapped in a factory together during a snowstorm with absolutely no one around. Left with only each other for warmth, will Kawabata be able to restrain himself? Plagued by his neighbor's incessant alarm clock every morning, Higashi decides to take matters into his own hands, only, he's given a key instead?! How did one innocent little key change the lives of two men? How far will you trust your neighbor? Find out about these and more in Koshino’s My Neighbor!
