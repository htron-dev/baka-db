## Sinopse

An educational fire safety anime commissioned by the Tokyo Fire Department. It stars a girl whose family died in a fire due to arson. She herself was severely burned and disfigured and barely alive. She was taken to the hospital and given a cyborg body which gave her powers to transform into Firegirl, so she can fight fire disasters and to teach kids fire safety as well as notifying a figure of authority if they see someone who might be committing arson.
