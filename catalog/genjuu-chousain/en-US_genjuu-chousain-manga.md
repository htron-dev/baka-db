## Sinopse

In a dangerous land where fantastical creatures exist, humans must live beside dragons and other supernatural monsters. That's where Mythical Beast Investigators like Ferry come in. Ferry might look like a young girl, but she has extensive knowledge of magical creatures and dreams of creating peace between humankind and monsters.

With her otherworldly bodyguard Kushuna by her side, Ferry will work to calm any conflict, no matter where that takes her!
