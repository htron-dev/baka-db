## Sinopse

Inoue is a young student whose secret passion is the cello. One night of drinking, he collapses in front of a rather special coffee whose clients are all fans of music and are part of the orchestra of the city. They immediately offered him to join the band. But Inoue has a problem: he has not learned to read music! He wants to progress, however, especially for the lovely Tamoto. But apparently, she is already in love. How will he get her attention?
