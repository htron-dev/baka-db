    "sinopse": "Empress of the Eastern Nation Navier Ellie Trovi stands at the pinnacle of noblewomen with dignity and grace. Although she and her husband, Emperor Sovieshu, are not as intimate as other couples, their trust in each other has been built over years of friendship. But then, wanting something more, he brings in a concubine—a former slave named Rashta—and that is when everything begins to fall apart.\n\nMonths later, the fateful day arrives; Sovieshu declares his intentions to divorce Navier and give her throne to Rashta. However, against all expectations, Navier is not backed against a wall, and she declares her intention to marry another man—Heinrey—whose noble appearance shocks all in the room.\n\nJust who is Heinrey, and how did Navier come to this new marriage arrangement? The Eastern Nation stands at a precipice, being torn apart by conspiracies, lies, and—above all—love.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
