## Sinopse

Eiji is inevitably dumped by women within a month of dating and they all say the same thing—he's too boring. After his latest break-up, his little brother's friend, Kou, declares Eiji should go out with him, so he can prove Eiji isn't a boring guy. Eiji is easily led around by the bold Kou and soon can't take his eyes off him.
