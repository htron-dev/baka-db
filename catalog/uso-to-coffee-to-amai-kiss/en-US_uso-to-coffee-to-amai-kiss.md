## Sinopse

When Kano, a cafe owner, was attacked by some hoodlums dispatched by a land shark; a secretive, shady character, Otowa came to his rescue! Since then, Otowa frequented Kano's cafe and kept the yakuza at bay. Kano was unaware of the danger he's in and started to look forward to Otowa's visit... Until an equally dangerous man lured Kano out of Otowa's protection, and all hell broke loose...!
