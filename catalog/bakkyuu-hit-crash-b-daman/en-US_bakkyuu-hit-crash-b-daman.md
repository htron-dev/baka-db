Hitto Tamaga used to live a peaceful life in Manaka City. With his gifted sight he, along with his friend Mamoru Matoba, runs small errands for people who lost their valuables. However, Hitto's life is bound to change on his eleventh birthday.

Therein; Hitto receives his B-Daman, Magnum Ifrit from his father. Since that day forth, several dangerous individuals had been after Hitto's Magnum Ifrit.
