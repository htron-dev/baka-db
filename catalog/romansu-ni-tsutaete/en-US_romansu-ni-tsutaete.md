## Sinopse

A collection of four short stories:

The first and second story have the same heroine. She works at a daycare center or kindergarten, and unknown to her colleagues she used to be a much feared female gang leader. Also, the heroine has good vibes about a certain male colleague. One fine day, she meets an ex-male gang leader who knows her past.. and events start unraveling from there.

For the second story, it's set in the daycare/kindergarten too. The main character is one of the kids in the kindergarten, and he has a secret which he is afraid to let other people know, especially his beloved teacher (The heroine is his beloved teacher)!

Story #3
The main heroine is a 16 year old girl. Her father is a scientist and always invents some weird things.What's more, he claims that he came from another planet! All these drive the poor heroine crazy, but at least now her love life is going fine.. until the day 2 guys from outer space lands on Earth, wanting to find out more about the 'Love disease'! Perhaps her father has not been lying after all?
