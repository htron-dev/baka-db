## Sinopse

Aki Himejima is a lawyer who used to be a bad boy... and he has a secret. Although he acts cool and masculine at the office, he adores cute things... and loves to be treated like a beautiful princess. Yakuza gangster Ryuuji, a younger guy he went to school with, is the only person who knows about it. Ryuuji is in love with Aki, and he lavishes him with the sweet words that Aki wants to hear. Ryuuji is devoted to giving him all the pleasure that he desires, even if the lawyer figures that it's just a handy method of release for the younger guy. And Aki has been in love with someone else for a long time... A yaoi comic about a younger yakuza who never gives up and a former bad-boy lawyer who wants to be treated like a princess!
