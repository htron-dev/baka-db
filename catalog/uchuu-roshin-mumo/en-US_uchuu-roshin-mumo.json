    "sinopse": "Thanks to deviant sexuality (lolicon, obsession with 2D girls, etc.), the human birth rate has declined, and humanity is headed for extinction. A cute loli girl from outer space, called Muumo, has come to earth on a mission to correct this problem. She's going to save humanity by stomping on men with her magic galaxy shoes to eliminate their lolicon preferences! She has even met another human girl who can guide her to the places where she might find these deviant men. What could possibly go wrong with this plan?\n\n(Source: MU)",
