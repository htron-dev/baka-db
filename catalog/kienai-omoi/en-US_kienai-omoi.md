## Sinopse

What if my own love will hurt my precious friend? This is a gem of a collection of heart throbbing school love oneshots written by a recently popular author. "My first love is the one my best friend likes". Other than this oneshot about the painful, wavering feeling between love and friendship, this collection contains three other oneshots.
