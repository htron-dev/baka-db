## Sinopse

Jin Inohara's life as a veteran adult industry actor is sleeping with someone new. But, when he becomes an actor for the Cherry Bonbon series, Jin finds himself paired up long term with Hikaru Amou. Jin and Hikaru's videos sell well, and they gain popularity as a pair, leading to more and more videos of them together. Yet, despite their intimacy on screen, Jin and Hikaru don't know much about each other's private lives. That is... until Jin realizes he lives in the same apartment building as Hikaru.
