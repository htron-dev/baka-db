## Sinopse

Takagi and Kanemura are two normal high-school students in a near-future Japan where many things are different but taken in stride. Technology has evolved to the point where items like face-blurring necklaces, sleep-control devices, and Willy Wonkaish meal-flavored gum are treated as fads. New services also dot the landscape, such as businesses that can help you reclaim memories and places that can upload dead people to the internet to continue living their lives in virtual reality. The two girls also treat encounters with androids, strange monsters, and aliens as somewhat normal occurrences.

Dainana Joshikai Houkou is a fantastical slice of futuristic life that proves that while society can change, people seem to stay the same.
