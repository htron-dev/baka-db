## Sinopse

The story evolves around Chandra Nalaar, a young firemage who trains at the Kerald Keep in the mountains to learn how to control her powers. But life isn't that easy because the Order of Heliud, a sect of mages bent on imposing their draconian law across the land, is now also expanding their dominion to the woodlands near the Keep. The Order's ever-increasing influence is an affront to all Chandra holds sacred: freedom, individuality, the right of self determination, and most of all, the right to blow things up. So the young mage is sent on a mission to find out more about the order but her impulsive spirit is about to cause her a whole lot of trouble...
