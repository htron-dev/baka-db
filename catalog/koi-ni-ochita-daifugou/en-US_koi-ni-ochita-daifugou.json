    "sinopse": "This strange man who's suddenly appeared...just who is he?\n\nCircumstances led Sophy to take a DNA test, but now she's misplaced the all-important letter containing the results and can't find it anywhere. If anyone else sees it, it will mean major trouble for her! In a panic, she searches a room reserved for breastfeeding, but, as if to thwart her search, the room is already occupied...by a shirtless, muscular man who is shaving. Sophy turns bright red and averts her eyes while he keeps a perfect poker face—it's almost as though he had known she was coming. Just who is this thoroughly mysterious man?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
