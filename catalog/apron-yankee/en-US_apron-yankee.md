## Sinopse

Two yankees who were the strongest in the place, Taiga and Ryuusei. One day Taiga suffers an accident in a fight which leaves him in a coma. After that incident, Ryuusei disappears. Three years later, Taiga leaves the hospital with the intention of looking for his "Aniki," only to realize that he now is a preschool teacher and wants nothing to do with Taiga anymore.
