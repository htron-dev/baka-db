## Sinopse

Naoki has his heart broken by a straight man and resolves never to love a guy who isn't gay again. Unfortunately, fate seems to be trying to throw him together repeatedly with a straight, cute, sweet man named Yuuma. Yuuma is starting to fall for his new gay friend Naoki, though Naoki is the first guy he has ever felt this way about. One drunken night they can't help but touch each other, but in the morning Naoki angrily tells Yuuma that they've made a mistake. Can Naoki put aside his fears, trust Yuuma, and allow the love between them to grow?
