Tsubasa has been in love with Shou for years, but never found the courage to talk to him about it. Still, she thinks he may feel the same... until they meet a girl who changes everything. Could she be the one whom Shou truly loves? And what does that mean for Tsubasa?\n\n(Source: Shoujo-Sense)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Sweet na Kare\nVolume 2: Koi no Jikan",
