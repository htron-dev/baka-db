## Sinopse

Takumi, a young guy born and raised in an environment filled with welfare, left our world without getting the chance of testing his abilities. Thanks to that regret, he's granted the opportunity to reincarnate in a new world.

In the presence of a Goddess, he decides to "reincarnate in a world where abilities are everything"!

After being reincarnated as a slave, he wakes up in a cell and starts gathering information from the other children in the room, including​ a gorgeous elf and a beautiful beastman who will become his comrades. With that, he starts to walk down the road to become a slaves' merchant.
