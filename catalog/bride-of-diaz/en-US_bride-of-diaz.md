## Sinopse

Based on Patricia Wilson's novel "Bride of Diaz"

A passionate attraction in romantic Spain. He offered her marriage -- but said nothing of love.... Rodrigo Esteband Diaz ignited the most intense and passionate emotions Laura Marsh had ever felt. Her new job as nurse-companion to Rodrigo's mother brought her into close contact--and frequent conflict--with the autocratic Spanish count. She discovered that Rodrigo had less in common with his own century than with the savage long-ago era of his ancestors--the conquistadors--men who took what they wanted and took it by force. What Rodrigo wanted was a bride to carry on the noble line of Diaz. And the bride he wanted was Laura....
