## Sinopse

Just as Mimori Ichirou, a non-commissioned officer serving as a Zero fighter pilot during the Pacific War, was about to launch a kamikaze attack against an enemy warship, he instead found himself crash-landing in the middle of an unfamiliar desert. However, before he could perish from aimlessly wandering the sand-covered wastes, he was saved by a princess capable of transforming into a dragon.

As a stranger in an even stranger land with no directions to guide him, Ichirou—driven by a promise once made—nonetheless resolved himself to find his way back home to Japan, even if all that awaited him was certain death.
