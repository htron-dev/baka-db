## Sinopse

A collaboration between the Eagle Talon franchise and Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san. The former is promoting the latter's TV series. In a tongue-in-cheek style Yoshida-kun "explains" what Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san is about but gets it hilariously wrong much to the shock and frustration of Honda-san himself, such that never getting his name right.
