    "sinopse": "A collaboration between Brave Frontier the mobile RPG game, and the Himitsukessha Taka no Tsume anime franchise.\n\nThis short is starts out with an animated Eiji Takahashi (Brave Frontier director) mimicking the Taka no Tsume NEO Announcement Movie trailer. It then delves into explaining that he will be director for the new DC Super Heroes vs. Taka no Tsume Dan film and that there will be a wide variety of benefits between both franchises (discount movie tickets for Brave Frontier gamers, movie characters in the game for Taka no Tsume watchers, etc.). It also features an animated Kaoringo (nickname), who is a real life female public relations staff member for Brave Frontier in the editorial department of Famitsu App. One of the benefits is tickets to a showing where she gives a live in-person introduction to the theater's audience before the movie begins.",
