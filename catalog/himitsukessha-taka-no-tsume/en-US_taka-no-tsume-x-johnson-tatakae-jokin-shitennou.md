## Sinopse

A collaboration between the Eagle Talon franchise and S.C. Johnson's Japanese branch.

Eagle Talon has a giant mold monster in their base, and a sentai group called Jokin Shitennou who look eerily like Yoshida appear to fight the mold with their cleaning superpowers (each hero is based on 1 real S.C. Johnson cleaning product).

The second episode focuses on the mold killer disinfectant push type alcohol bottle; that sentai hero shows a family just how much mold and bacteria are on the kitchen table just from wiping it with a wet rag. She then uses her product powers to eliminate the health hazard.
