    "sinopse": "A Matsue City collaboration anime with Eagle Talon. Yoshida and Hifumi Arai go exploring the city for these beautifying locations. All 3 episodes (and the prologue) were uploaded on the same day but then a bit later episode 2 and 3 were removed. They were then reuploaded the week after and the week after that, as a minor semblance to a weekly released series instead.",
