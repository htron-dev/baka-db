## Sinopse

A collaboration episode between Himitsukessha Taka no Tsume and Glass no Kamen Desu ga meant to promote the latter's official TV anime launch as well as the former's 4th season launch.

In this collaboration two Chancellors appear. Deluxe Fighter then shows up to eliminate both since there can't be a double amount of evil in the world. One Chancellor comes forward to reveal themselves as Ayumi Himekawa acting as the Chancellor. Then Deluxe Fighter unveils themselves as Maya Kitajima. Both women are rivals in the Glass no Kamen franchise and frequently one-up each other acting, which leaves the real Chancellor and Yoshida confused as to why the came to their compound and even more confused that (breaking the 4th wall for self-deprecating humor) DLE will be animating the new Glass no Kamen anime.
