Eliza does her twin sister a favor and goes to a party in her place, but how long will she be able to fend off the roguish glances of her sister's boyfriend? He seems intent on taking her to bed. Eliza is trying to find a way out of the situation when her first love, Giles, appears out of the crowd. Just seeing his face brings back old memories... and he's the only one who can help her now! She explains the situation and asks for his help. But he says he wants something in return!
