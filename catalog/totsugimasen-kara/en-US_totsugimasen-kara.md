## Sinopse

Itsuki Amamiya, an average male omega who just graduated high school, has next to no job prospects. Thus, he follows the advice of his mother to work part-time over the summer following his graduation. He arrives at the place his mother found—an upscale traditional Japanese home—only to find out that she set him up. Rather than a job, she sent him to a daughter-in-law competition!

Many other omegas have gathered, all in hopes of marrying the alpha Jin Tenmei, heir of the affluent Tenmei family. However, tradition dictates a lengthy process to select the bride; thus, the competition was born. Although initially reserved, Itsuki butts heads with Jin and declares his intentions to make Jin fall head over heels for him!
