## Sinopse

The first short VR work of the popular TV anime Osomatsu-san. An immersive VR experience of the everyday lives of sextuplets. The setting is the bathhouse that fans know and love. The same all-star lineup of voice actors as the TV anime talk to you, a player in the VR world. It seems that only you have the supernatural powers to grant the wishes of each of the sextuplets. What is it that the sextuplets want? And can you indeed fulfill their wishes...?
