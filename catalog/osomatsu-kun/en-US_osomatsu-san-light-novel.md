## Sinopse

Matsuno household has six naughty and mischievous sons (who are sextuplets), led by the eldest Osomatsu. They were grade-schoolers back in the Showa period, but despite still living in the same old household, the street view, as well as the lifestyle of modern day society, have changed drastically.
