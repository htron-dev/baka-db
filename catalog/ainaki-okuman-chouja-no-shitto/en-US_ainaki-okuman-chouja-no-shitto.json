Alejandro initially rejects her ideas, but after showcasing her strong business acumen, Elise scores the biggest PR gig of her career. She is excited to pursue the dream... until she gets a desk next to Alejandro. The selfish, demanding CEO drives her wild, but Elise can't help but look upon him fondly. He has such lonely eyes... This man doesn't know what love is... but then, neither does she.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
