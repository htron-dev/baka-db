## Sinopse

Panic disorder, depression, developmental disorder, PTSD... Japan is said to be a country of hidden mental illnesses, where many patients suffer from mental illnesses without being able to talk to anyone. The suicide rate is one of the worst among developed countries. How has Japan fallen into this kind of situation? Psychiatrist Konosuke Yowai confronts the problems facing Japan's psychiatric care and sheds light on the shadows in people's minds.
