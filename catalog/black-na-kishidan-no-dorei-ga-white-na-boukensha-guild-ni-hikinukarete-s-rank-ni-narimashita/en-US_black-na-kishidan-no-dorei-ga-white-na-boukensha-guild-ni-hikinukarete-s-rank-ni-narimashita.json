    "sinopse": "I worked like a slave in the chivalric order, where all the outcomes were exploited by my senior, but I was scouted by a pretty little girl who called herself a guildmaster.\n\nInitially I accepted it half-jokingly, but after I was shown a great sum of advance payment, I decided to leave the chivalric order. When I went to the guild, even the title of S-rank was prepared.\n\n—This is a success story of a man who has never had a good thing since he was born.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
