## Sinopse

Based on Sharon de Vita's novel "Lady and the Legend."

Score one for love. A lady did not raise her voice, lose her temper, or cuss like a sailor. But after five minutes with Gator McCallister, Victoria Fairchild was guilty of all three. When her grandfather left her his prized football team, the Cannons, he hadn't warned her about its legendary coach! But the growling bear was really a gentle cub, and the business proposition he offered wasn't nearly as enticing as the kisses that turned her knees to butter. Or as delectable as the sexy man who put a dignified lady into jeans and made her happier than she'd ever dreamed!
