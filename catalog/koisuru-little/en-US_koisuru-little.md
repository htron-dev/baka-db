## Sinopse

The story revolves around Mito Chiharu, a first year in high school. Ever since she was little she wouldn't be able to succeed, whether it was studying, cooking or playing the piano, even though she tried very hard. That's why when her effort finally paid off with running, she became a track and field maniac ever since then—to the point she stopped talking to boys. One day she is fetching the notebooks from the staff room, when she accidentally bumps into a boy from another class, the popular basketball club regular, sleepy-head Yuuki Tomohiro... What will happen?
