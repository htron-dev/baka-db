Still, it seems that her friend and Kaito have feelings for each other, something that a trip to the zoo is threatening to confirm.\n\nAugust, Tale of the Green Dream\nMitsuka falls hard for the mute Jun during her summer vacation beach trip, but the closer they get the more he seems to still have feelings for another girl. Or does he?\n\nCast A Spell on Me\nRei is crushed when she finds out that the cute boy who pets her dog every morning, Miki, is going out with her fickle best friend. Then, when the group goes on vacation with some friends, Rei finds herself turned into a dog. She uses the chance to get closer to Miki, but in the end she's just a dog, not a girl.",
