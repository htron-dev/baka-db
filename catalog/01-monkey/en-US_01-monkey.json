    "sinopse": "Senke is a gloomy and shy man who's secretly in love with Masaharu, a mailman in the company he works for. His inability to confess to Masaharu leads him to lavish his love upon a Digital Monkey on his PC, which he names Masaharu. The recession, his low-paying job as a dispatch worker, and a demanding boss causes him to work overtime night after night. One night, fed up with seeing Senke working to exhaustion, Masahuru confronts Senke and in the process finds out about his Digital Pet. The stressed Senke breaks down and rapes Masahuru. After this disastrous incident, Masaharu avoids Senke. Senke works mindlessly and fulfills all the demands of his boss until he discovers that his Monkey Masaharu has died. In his exhausted state of mind and having a guilty conscience, he thinks this to be a sign, and dashes off to find Masaharu. When he finds Masaharu safe and sound, he is relieved and collapses.\n\n(Source: Loveless)",
