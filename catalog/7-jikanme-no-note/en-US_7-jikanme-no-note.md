## Sinopse

Youhei is in the Woodwinds Orchestra at his high school where he plays the clarinet as one of the few boys in the group. The president of the group is Azumi who also happens to be Youhei's first girlfriend. Azumi has never had a boyfriend before and the couple has many awkward moments as their relationship is still fresh. With both Youhei and Azumi acting a little shy with each other, being intimate is difficult but their love for each other makes them braver.
