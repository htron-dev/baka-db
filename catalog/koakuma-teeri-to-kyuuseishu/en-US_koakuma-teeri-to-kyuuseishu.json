    "sinopse": "I, Souichirou, picked up this little girl on a certain rainy day. Even though she has pink hair and unfamiliar cosplay looking clothes, she is just a normal girl. If there is one thing not normal, then that would be: the single black wing, which is growing out from her back. She who claims to be a devil, says that she has no place to return to, so I decided to keep her in my house. But that isn't the only problem. Then on the next day, a blonde bishoujo claiming to be an angel visits my house. And according to this girl, I have hidden possibility to either become a \"Saviour\" or a \"Super Villain\"!?\n\nThe ecchi Love-comedy of Delinquent X Devil girl X Angel girl given by the super popular creator duo!\n\n(Source: Baka-Tsuki)",
