However, Yuki-chan has become too involved in his Kendo club and is even being labeled as the “Hope” of the club. Now, I feel more and more like I have been cast aside. But I love him, so I want to be with him and become his equal. Struggling between love and dreams, what would be our fate being that we’re such a clumsy couple…?\n\n(Source: Fantasy Shrine)",
