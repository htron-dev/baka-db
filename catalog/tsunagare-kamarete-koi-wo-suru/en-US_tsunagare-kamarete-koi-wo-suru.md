## Sinopse

Ayato Hiro doesn't have a single living relative. He ends up working in a Western confectionery shop after being discovered by its owner, Chitose Narazaki. Ayato falls in love with Chitose, but the other man doesn't appear to return his feelings. Having to live together with Chitose forces Ayato to lose his patience, and he makes a move on him one evening. Their relationship becomes more intense, though Ayato is concerned about Chitose's true intentions...
