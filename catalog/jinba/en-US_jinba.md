## Sinopse

Set during the warring states period where humans use centaurs as livestock and treat them no better than animals. Matsukaze is a proud and wild centaur. He sacrifices his freedom to save his companion and meets Kohibari, a tame centaur who has given up all hope of escaping his human owners. If they can get over their differences and work together, they just might be able to return to the wilds as free centaurs.
