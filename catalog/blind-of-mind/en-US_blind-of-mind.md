## Sinopse

A collection of 11 oneshots from Coga Mayumi, including Hibi Kira Kira:

It’s summer holidays for Tomoaki and he is helping out at the daily morning exercise for kids. But recently, he notices that a young man living beside the park has been looking at the exercise group every morning. Is the young man a Lolicon that is targeting his kids, or is it entirely something else?
