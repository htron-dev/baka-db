    "sinopse": "\"I won't let him get away with this, that horrible man!\" After reading an article that slanders her best friend Sarah, Carrie bursts into an independent newspaper publishing corporation to complain. There she finds a man with gray eyes so handsome, he takes Carrie's breath away. The man seems indifferent to Carrie's anger and, rather than attend to her complaint, teases her. Despite their constant arguing, a special relationship forms between them, but Carrie's painful past means she is too afraid to love again. But they both can't pretend not to notice their passionate love for each other burning within...\n\n(Source: MU)",
