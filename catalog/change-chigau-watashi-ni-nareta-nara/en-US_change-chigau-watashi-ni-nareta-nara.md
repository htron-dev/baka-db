## Sinopse

A compilation of 4 different stories with four different authors.

Story 1: Much to Komatsu Anri’s dismay, she ends up switching bodies with her twin brother Senri. However in this case, the switch was a deliberate action by Senri! For reasons unknown to Anri, Senri used a book of magic and performed a spell that caused the switch. Anri is horrified and can’t understand why Senri, who has always been her best friend and closest person, could do such a thing. Senri hints that the reason for the switch is so that he could be close as a girl to his classmate and good friend Hokuto. But it’s Anri who ends up close to Hokuto because she must act like Senri at school. Hokuto is good friends with Senri, so Anri suddently finds herself talking to him a lot… and falling for him…

Story 2: The heroine, Ruby, is a student at Princess Gakuen. Her grades are poor, and she is looked down upon by the snooty girls at her school. One day she rescues a little frog from being squashed by her arrogant classmate Crystal. For some reason Ruby is not surprised when the frog talks to her. His name is Silver. He and Ruby become good friends. Meanwhile, a prince from a southern country is visiting the school, and a ball is being held in his honor. All the girls at the school are after the prince and want his kiss, including Ruby… will she live happily ever after?
