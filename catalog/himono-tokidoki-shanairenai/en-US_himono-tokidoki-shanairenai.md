## Sinopse

Kimura is well-known for being a "perfect man", but he has a secret that no one knows. In truth, he is a man that has withered like dried fish, or what you call — a devitalized man! With his worn-out shirt and pajamas, he spends his time in his messy room with his cat and a can of beer. However, after a drinking party, he spends the night with his cheeky subordinate, Nishiguchi, in a hotel. Will that be the end of his peaceful life?!
