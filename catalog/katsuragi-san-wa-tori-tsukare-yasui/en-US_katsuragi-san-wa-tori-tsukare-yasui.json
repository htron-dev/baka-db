    "sinopse": "Katsuragi, a friendly office worker, often works overtime to help his colleagues. His recent worries all concern the mysterious handsome convenience store clerk, Mizuki. The customer serviceman is an unfriendly guy, but for some reason their eyes meet and his shoulder is often touched at the cash register. However, what Mizuki is actually touching are the ghosts that often possess Katsuragi!?\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Kimi wa Egao wa SSR",
