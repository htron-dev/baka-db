## Sinopse

Aliens from the Planet Voice have invaded the Earth and plan to take over. However, their method is unusual. Instead of giant armies and messy wars, they plan to take over by forming a mega-corporation that will eventually take over all of Earth's big business. Fortunately, five brave heroes of the corporate world are here to defend us! Clad in majestic suits of Red, Grey, Sepia, Moss Green, and Salmon Pink, the Sentai Team 'Shinesman' fights for corporate justice!
