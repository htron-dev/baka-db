    "sinopse": "Hajime is a guy who can't talk to girls properly, even to a game character. But then a girl who calls Hajime her father, barges in on him while he is working. It seems that she has come from the future and she was Hajime's daughter. She has come back to the past to cause a breakup between Hajime and a lady who he is supposed to marry in the future, and make sure they won't get married. The bad part is that she still does not know who the lady is.\n\n(Source: MU)",
