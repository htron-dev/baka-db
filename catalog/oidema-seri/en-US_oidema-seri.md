## Sinopse

Daidai Machi, situated near a major grain producing region, nestled up against a gigantic tree, is the place where the people live out their lives. Seri has moved to this town that opens into the distant beyond, blossoming with alien culture. I invite you to join in on Seri's daily life, which she lives by the motto of "I wont work hard."
