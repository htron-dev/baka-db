    "sinopse": "Akari couldn't think less of her school's karate champ, Abe-kun, despite him being the national champion. He's giant, uncouth, and couldn't be more different than her sweet angel and childhood friend, Takuto. But when Abe-kun injures his arm protecting her, she takes it upon herself to get him healed—after all, the school's pride is at stake—but finds the tables suddenly turned when he confesses to her! Now she's the goal he's aiming for, and she'll soon find out how driven a national champion can be!\n\n(Source: Kodansha Comics USA)",
