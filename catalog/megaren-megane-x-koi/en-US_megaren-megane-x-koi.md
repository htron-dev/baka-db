## Sinopse

The resident class hottie in Madoka's class is none other than Takashi-kun, aka Mr. Four-Eyes. He's someone she's known since childhood, and he's a super computer geek. She can't believe his popularity with the girls in their class, and so decides that there's no way she's going to fall for him like the rest of them, but one day...
