    "sinopse": "It retells stories featured in the manga and anime series.\n\nThe novel is actually composed of two short stories, both alredy published in the manga: Yahiko's Fight and Black Hat.\n\nIn the first story, Yaahiko in order to protect the young Tsubame, has to face a group of dangerous outloaws. At first he is defeated, but his samurai pride doesn't allow him to give up. So he faces those men again, ending up with a strategy who allow him to turn their advantage of being more numerous into the cause of their defeat.\n\nThe second episode, the protagonists are Udou Jinne, a former Shinsengumi, and Kenshin. In order to force Himura to fight against him, Jinne kidnappes Kaoru and using Nikaido, a sort of hypnotic technique, he puts her in a condition of being incapable of breathing. This awakes Kenshin's fury, and the two samurai will have to fight a death match.\n\n(Souce: RK Sword of Justice)",
