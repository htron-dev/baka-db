    "sinopse": "Off-limits... but irresistible!\n\nRocco D'Angelo doesn't do needy women -- and he certainly doesn't do commitment! But the spark notorious playboy Rocco feels with his beloved grandmother's nurse, Emma Marchant, is more than the usual thrill-of-the-chase adrenaline!\n\nNever in her wildest dreams did cautious Emma imagine she would be swept from a sleepy English village to the exotic climes of the Italian Riviera -- especially by a man as disreputable as Rocco.\n\nEmma could be the one to tame the untamable -- unless her infatuation is more dangerous than she imagined...\n\n(Source: MU)",
