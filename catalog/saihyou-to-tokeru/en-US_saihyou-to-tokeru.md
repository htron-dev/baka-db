## Sinopse

From his older brother's recommendation, Kazushi went to visit the art museum at his hometown. There, he was captivated by a pair of eyes that had once halted him before. However, those eyes were trickling with tears... Kazushi, who has known the reason for the tears for a while now, has since always been holding onto Rui in order for his feelings to reach him...?
