## Sinopse

Linda is a daughter of Count Sharot in the land called Degrus. The land of Zaromon has been seeking a chance to attack Degrus. However, the King of Degrus is always having a party. When Linda is in a party, a group of Zaromons come into the room. A harpist rescues Linda. The harpist says the group just pretended being Zaromons and that they were actually working for Count Zolge, who is a traitor. Linda wonders why she knows the harpist's name is Julius. Julius also knows the name of Linda even though they've never met before.
