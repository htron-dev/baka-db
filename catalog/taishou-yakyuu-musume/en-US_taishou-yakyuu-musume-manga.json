    "sinopse": "In 1925, after being told by a baseball player that women should become housewives instead of going to school, two 14-year-old Japanese high school girls named Koume and Akiko decide to start a baseball team in order to prove him wrong. During this time, when even running was considered too vulgar for women, baseball is known as \"what the boys do\" and they face many difficulties when having to find enough members, to get permission from their parents and also when learning about the sport itself.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
