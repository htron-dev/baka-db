## Sinopse

Six years ago, Nick Merrick made Corrie Davis promise not to pursue his brother Shane. Now Shane is back in her life after several years on the rodeo circuit, and Nick is concerned about a romance forming between his brother and a woman far below their station. He invites Corrie over for dinner to question her about her relationship with Shane, but this only succeeds in igniting Corrie’s long-simmering love for Nick. With the brothers fighting about how to protect and grow their family business as well as who deserves Corrie’s affections, what’s a poor Texas girl to do?
