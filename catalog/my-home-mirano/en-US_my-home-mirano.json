    "sinopse": "Mirano is a rare find among young women. Not because she is young and pretty, she happens to be both those things, but rather at only 20 years of age, she has the job she'd been dreaming of since childhood... she is a housekeeper. Not exactly the kind of job that \"A Woman of the 90's\" usually shoots for, but for Mirano it is what she always wanted. She absolutely loves cooking, cleaning, and pretty much anything else \"domestic,\" so being a housekeeper is a natural career choice, short of getting married and starting a family for herself. She was so sure of her ultimate goal, she immediately began her training to be a housekeeper after graduating high school instead of going off to college.",
