## Sinopse

Inspector Reiko Kujou is a problematic detective who gave up the big-city police work to be transferred to the Akasaka Police Department. She's got the face and figure of a model, a keen mind, and on top of that, is an ultra-rich detective from a well-established family! Obsessed with brand-name items, doing car chases in foreign cars; she'll be stopping evil in a magnificent way! And how will the romance turn out between her and the younger detective Sanada who longs for her!? An intense romantic-suspense from Nanao Hidaka! (Source: Jmanga)
