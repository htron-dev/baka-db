## Sinopse

A narcissistic apprentice devil suddenly appears before a lonely shut-in?

In order to pass his final exam, Tougo Nishizaki, an apprentice devil, makes a contract with the shut-in college student Sugishita Masato. He'll grant three of Masato's wishes in exchange for his chastity and life energy.

Another apprentice devil, Yoichi Murase, has a contract with Nishiima. His arrival brings the lives of these four together in a story you can't take your eyes off of!
