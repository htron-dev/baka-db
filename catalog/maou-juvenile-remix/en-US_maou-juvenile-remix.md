## Sinopse

Andou is a high-schooler who possesses the ability to force others to vocalize his thoughts—an ability similar to ventriloquism. Inukai is young man shrouded in mystery who commands the vigilante group, Grass Hopper, which appeared in a city shaken by the downtown restoration program. This is a tale of courage, resolution… and confrontation; this is a depiction of the two boys' encounter.
