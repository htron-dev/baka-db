## Sinopse

What will be the fate of the young man who awakened to the "reproduction" ability in a different world?

Heita Akiyama, who was enjoying his summer break in university, was suddenly thrown into extraordinary life. When he blinked, it wasn't the kitchen at his home anymore, but a dark room he didn't recognize. In front of him was a strange old person and people he couldn't communicate with. Heita, who couldn't understand the situation he was in, was lead out by a girl. When he went outside, he saw a cityscape clearly not from anywhere in Japan.

While talking to the girl, who called herself "Minor Goddess Eramela," Heita learned his situation. Angry about being kidnapped and brought to another world, he was calmed down by Eramela. Heita resigned himself to spend some time in this world. His life in another world, full of meetings with new people and adventurous encounters, is about to begin.
