## Sinopse

Even at their colleagues' wedding, the sparkling members of Marukawa Publishing's Emerald Department stand out. Having been invited to assist in providing entertainment for the guests, Masamune Takano, Ritsu Onodera, Yoshiyuki Hatori, Shouta Kisa, Kanade Mino, as well as Takafumi Yokozawa enjoy the festivities as much as their work allows.

As love blossoms between two individuals, marriage marks a momentous occasion fit for self-reflection. Whether they like it or not, the men of Marukawa need to consider where their own relationships are headed.
