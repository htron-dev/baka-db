## Sinopse

Takafumi Yokozawa has had his heart broken. In despair, he chooses to drown his sorrows the only way he knows how—with a metric ton of booze.

After ending up blackout drunk, Takafumi wakes up naked in a hotel room. Greeted by Zen Kirishima, a coworker and editor-in-chief of the shounen manga magazine Japun, Takafumi finds himself being subjected to blackmail. As it turns out, Zen had taken some rather incriminating pictures the night before. Takafumi must follow along with the editor's every whim; he is tricked into drinking together, eating fancy meals he cannot afford, and even visiting the Kirishima household.

Slowly, with the help of Zen and his daughter, Hiyori, Takafumi finds himself forgetting all about his broken heart.
