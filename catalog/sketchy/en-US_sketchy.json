Between her job and her boyfriend, her daily life is hectic, yet aimless, until one day when she becomes captivated by the sight of a skater girl. The hope that she'd gradually lost sight of turned into a future that gradually came into view: now was the time to make a change. These are the days of hardships and new beginnings for a woman who fell in love with skateboarding.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
