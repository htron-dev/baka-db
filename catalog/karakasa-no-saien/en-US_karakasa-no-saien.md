## Sinopse

Ibusuki Rokusuke is unlucky enough to have a girl who's downright crazy for him. While trying to escape her twisted idea of love, he sneaks into an inn... which happens to be run by a witch who does not appreciate it when people try to stay without paying first.

...oh, and the crazy girl got there before him. Poor guy...
