    "sinopse": "A “psychological sci-fi mystery,” which features an alien appearing in unexpected places in contemporary Japan. While Hagio is characteristically careful in her use of science, these tales, like most of Hagio’s are ultimately more about psychological issues, and individuals overcoming trauma, fear, and insecurity in the process of forming bonds with each other.\n\n(source: matt-thorn)",
