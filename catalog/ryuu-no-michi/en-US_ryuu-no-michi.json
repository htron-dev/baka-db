Things take a turn for the unexpected, however, when Ryuu wakes up to find himself the sole survivor of the expedition, the spaceship having crash landed on a grossly mutated and wholly unfamiliar Earth.\n\nJoining forces with fellow survivors from a different crash, Ryuu and his comrades fight to survive on this new and deadly Earth as they search for any humans that might have made it through the mysterious apocalypse.\n\n(Source: MU)",
