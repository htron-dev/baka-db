    "sinopse": "Haruki Karaboshi has no presence as far as can be recognized, and so he became an adventurer with only the desire to \"stand out.\" One day, a dungeon appeared under his home in Hokkaido. Coincidentally, he picked up a \"Skill Board\" with which he can spend skill points to increase his growth rate. Is it possible to become a popular person by obsessively diving into your home dungeon every day?\n\n(Source: Futabasha, translated)",
