"They do not care even if I can see their panties!"

High school student Daisuke Kaji, who is bad with gals, was made to deliver something to the house of the biggest monster gal, Chiriko Iega. Forced to bring Iega to her bedroom, Kaji is shocked by her unimaginably filthy room! After being amazed by the level of cleaning knowledge Kaji demonstrated, Iega extorts him into cleaning her entire room!
