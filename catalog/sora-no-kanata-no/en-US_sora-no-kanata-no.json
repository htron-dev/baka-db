    "sinopse": "The \"Time Loss Phenomenon,\" causes all living beings on Earth to be temporarily turned into statues. During Time Loss, only certain humans -- \"Recievers\" -- can remain active, and they witness the terrible reality of what's happening: otherworldly monsters are attempting to breach the human dimension.\n\nFirst year middle school student Futaba Sorano and her friend are in the middle of a tennis match when all of a sudden a fish-like monster appears out of the sky. At the same time, everyone around Sorano turns into stone, and then are transformed into monsters. While being chased by these monsters, a mysterious boy named Riu appears, and explains that it is up to her, and the other \"Receivers\", to use their strange new powers to save the earth from these intruders. Sorano and her fellow Receivers' epic battle to save the earth has begun!\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
