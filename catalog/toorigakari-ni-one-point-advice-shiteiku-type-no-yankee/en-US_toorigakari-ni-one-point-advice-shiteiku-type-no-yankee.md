## Sinopse

Quickly intimidated by his frightening gaze, many people wish they could avoid any contact with Kyou Sakurai. However, one only needs to spend a little bit of time with him to realize that beneath his scary appearance lies a warm personality. He gives short pieces of advice to everyone he meets, making their day brighter. With more people being drawn to Sakurai's considerateness, his entourage starts to grow as he continues to build strong bonds with everyone around him.
