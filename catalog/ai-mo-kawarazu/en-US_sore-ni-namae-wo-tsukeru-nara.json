    "sinopse": "Sano, a pure high school boy, is a virgin who wants to be popular among the ladies. In an unexpected turn of events, he meets the handsome and trendy Fujita, a university student who he respects as his \"master.\" When they happen to meet again in town, Fujita's eyes were swollen with tears from a fresh break-up. While hearing Fujita out, Sano learns that he's gay, and what's more, Fujita makes a strong suggestion—for Sano to lose his virginity to him!\n\n(Source: Tokyo Mangasha, translated)",
