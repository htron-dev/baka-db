    "sinopse": "Who does a person turn to if they need someone assassinated? They can contact the mysterious Tadashi Usobuki, a red-eyed assassin clothed in black. Spoken of as an urban legend, he requires no payment and leaves no evidence because he never actually kills anyone himself. His preferred method is to hypnotize his victims into committing suicide through the power of suggestion, or to manipulate events so that his desired outcome will be achieved.\n\nBut what does Usobuki get in compensation for his services? His \"payment\" is getting to relish in the folly of humankind, and oftentimes those who request his help end up far more sorrowful than they were before.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
