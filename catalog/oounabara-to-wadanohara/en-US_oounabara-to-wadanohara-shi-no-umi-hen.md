## Sinopse

The Sea Kingdom was invaded by the Totsusa Kingdom, but Wadanohara and her familiars managed to hold them back. The two princesses faced off with one another -- and suddenly the two kingdoms were at peace.

The war was seemingly over.... However, Wadanohara's original familiar, Samekichi, was thinking.
"Wadanohara.. I will definitely... protect you."

What are his true intentions? All will be revealed soon.
