## Sinopse

Kanna Koizumi is infatuated with a handsome customer who regularly orders the same meal combo from the restaurant she works at, but has never mustered the courage to ask him his name. The customer, Ren Toujo, has also noticed Kanna because she reminds him of Akira Sainishi, a woman he knew long ago.

Kanna and Ren pass by each other day after day, until one fateful night when Kanna and her parents drive past him and are subsequently hit by a truck. Ren is first to arrive at the bloody scene. Judging that her injuries are too severe to wait for an ambulance, he has to make the onerous decision—let Kanna die, or turn her into a vampire like him.
