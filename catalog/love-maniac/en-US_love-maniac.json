However, her rotten personality and selfish ways are too much for ANY guy, and she's never been able to date a guy for longer than a month before he dumps her! Things start looking up when she bumps into Miki, a childhood friend she hasn't seen since middle school who has a...very girly side to him, and she finds out that he goes to the same school as her latest crush! She decides to take advantage of this but first she has to butter up to him...instead she finds herself falling for him! Can she really be falling for a guy who paints his nails?!\n\n(Souce: JShoujo Scans)",
