## Sinopse

Chapter 1-2: Kare to Kare -- Masaru has been avoiding his childhood home, and his little brother, for about 5 years. But when he finally returns, his little brother hasn't forgotten their past together... or forgiven him for running away from it.

chapter 3: Love in Room 501 -- two childhood friends have grown apart in highschool. One's a good student who expresses himself sincerely and the other is a flippant dick-head. While the jerk exploits his feelings, the good student struggles to come to terms with the reality of their relationship.

chapter 4: I Want That Moon -- two office workers go on an onsen vacation together only to become vehicles for the vengeance of a ghostly murder victim

chapter 5-6: Let's Make a Band -- a group of teachers form a Visual Rock band in their spare time and hire one of their students as a member. Unfortunately the band is such a neurotic mess, they can't seem to get their act together long enough to play anything.
