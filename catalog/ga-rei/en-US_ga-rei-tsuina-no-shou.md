## Sinopse

The stage is Kyoto. Takiguchi Tsuina is a girl possessed by a curse that brings misfortune upon all those she falls in love with. Such a girl falls in love at first sight with the newly transfered Mikado-sempai, who is in fact an exorcist of the Department of Prevention of Supernatural Disasters. In order to walk along the same path as the one she loves, Tsuina becomes an apprentice of the wandering exorcist, Izuna.
