## Sinopse

Due to a particular incident, second-year high school student Izumi transferred schools and took his first year twice. He's not interested in getting along and making new friends, but his classmate Riku won him over, and they become each other's best friend... So now that Izumi had fallen in love with Riku, he chooses to hide his feelings to protect their friendship. But what happens when Izumi's former schoolmates out him in front of Riku?
