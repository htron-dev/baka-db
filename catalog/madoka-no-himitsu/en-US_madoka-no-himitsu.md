## Sinopse

Madoka Yamada (♂) loves all sorts of cute things! He grew up playing with dolls, sleeping with stuffed animals, and wearing girl's clothes that his sister made for him! The problem is, other people just don't understand, so when Madoka's family moves to a new city, he commits to acting like a boy at school. But what happens when his neighbor, Itsuki Tanonaka, finds out about his inclinations?!
