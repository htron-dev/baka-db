## Sinopse

This series is a complete remake of the original Maou Dante, with new designs an a story slightly inspired by the 2002 anime. This time, the story spans longer, the character design is different, and all unanswered questions left when the original series was interrupted, are responded. This time, Maou Dante has a proper ending.
