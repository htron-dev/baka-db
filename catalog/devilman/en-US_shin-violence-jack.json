    "sinopse": "This brief resurrection of Go Nagai's Violence Jack character appeared in 8 chapters in the magazine Comic Bunch in 2005 and has never been collected in a single volume. OK, resurrection may be the wrong word since Jack didn't actually die when Nagai ended the original series in 1990 and he also didn't bite it in the 2001 stand-alone short story DEMONS IN A WAR-TORN land. But you get the idea.\n\n(Source: deadfrog)",
