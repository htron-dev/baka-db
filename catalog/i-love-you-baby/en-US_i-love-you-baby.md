## Sinopse

You are the "first" of everything for me who is afraid of guys.

A 7th grade girl by the name of Mirei is not allowed to do anything after school due to her strict parents, but one day she goes out on her own after her mom has left for work. That day, she meets a boy that seems to be younger than her. What will become of this meeting?
