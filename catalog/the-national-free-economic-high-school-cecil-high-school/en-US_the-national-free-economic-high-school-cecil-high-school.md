## Sinopse

The story is based around a self survival concept. Youth unemployment is becoming a bigger social problem, and adolescents do not know how to survive without the aid of others. For this purpose, a group of politicians decide to create a school made to conquer that dilemma: Cecil High, the National Free Economic High School. Students are given 10,000,000원 admission money from the school to live off of, but there is a big catch! If a student runs out of money, he/she will be kicked off campus. At first glance, it seems like an exceptional deal, however, the balance is not as one would expect and many students quickly struggle to keep their education and avoid expulsion!
