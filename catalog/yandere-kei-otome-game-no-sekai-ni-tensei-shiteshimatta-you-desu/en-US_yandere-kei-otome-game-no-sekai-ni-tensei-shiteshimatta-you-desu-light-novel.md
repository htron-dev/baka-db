## Sinopse

As a precocious child, Licorice suffers from a strange sense of deja-vu. On the day her father told her about her fiancé, she realizes that her fiancé was actually a character from an otome game she once played in a previous life.

"I am the heroine's rival from that game? And in the bad ending, I get stabbed to death? What a joke."

The protagonist is determined to avoid the yandere around her.
