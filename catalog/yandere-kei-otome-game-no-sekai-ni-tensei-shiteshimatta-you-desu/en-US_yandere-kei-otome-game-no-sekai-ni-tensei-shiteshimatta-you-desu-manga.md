## Sinopse

Déjà vu—Licorice Radiata knows it all too well. Throughout her entire life, she has been plagued by vague feelings that everything has previously already come to pass. Then, after seeing a portrait of her fiancé Wolfgang Eisenhut, a surge of memories flow into her head: she is the rival character of a yandere otome game, and Wolfgang is one of the many "target" characters.

In the original storyline, Licorice was the jealous rival, committing terrible and violent acts, and even in the heroine's good ending, she would die a bloody death. Mustering her courage and scattered recollections, Licorice is ready to do whatever it takes to avoid such a dreadful downfall, but can she prevent Wolfgang from becoming a yandere? It is not that simple to alter the course of fate, and she may have to accept that one's nature is not so easily changed.
