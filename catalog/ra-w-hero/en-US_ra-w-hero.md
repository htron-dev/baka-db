## Sinopse

In a world where some of humanity possesses special abilities, those who use their powers for truth and justice are called "heros," and those who use them for evil are called "fiends."

In the midst of all this, the unemployed youth Chiaki, who is taking care of his younger siblings, is looking for a job. One day, on his way to a job interview, he notices the presence of a pervert and without thinking twice, jumps in to help the victim. This sense of justice is what leads Chiaki into a battle between good and evil, truth and deceit, and light and darkness.
