    "sinopse": "Iku Kurihara is an otaku happily living in Tokyo, keeping to himself outside of school and work and enjoying the latest anime and manga. One evening, as he is crossing a particular footbridge on his way home, he is jostled by a passerby and scatters a number of doujinshi on the ground. A good samaritan stops to help him collect his things, but Iku runs away without picking up one book, as he is aware that this person is a ghost who always haunts the bridge!\n\nThe ghost, Mimori Seo, is undeterred by Iku's escape and follows him in order to give back his lost item. Mimori is intrigued that Iku is able to see him, and despite himself, Iku is curious how Mimori can interact with physical objects. The two become roommates, and soon Iku grows concerned by Mimori's daily return to the bridge at 23:45 to seemingly reenact his death. Not only that, but every morning, Mimori reappears to Iku with no memories of the previous night! With his own hands, Iku resolves to break Mimori out of this endless cycle of having to relive his final moments.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
