## Sinopse

Okamura Hiiro is introverted and loves books. To him, books are his raison d'etre. His story starts with usual gimmick of summoning of heroes. Five people summoned, but one of them is just an outsider dragged in accidentally, that person is Hiiro. The four others are his classmates, but it's not like they are friends. Unlike him, they are riajuus. Hiiro decided not to help the country, his reason? "I don't believe you. I'm not friends with them. It's not my business, and I'm an ordinary person who cares for my own life, so bye," and he sets for his own journey. Little does others know, that this ordinary person, Hiiro, actually hides a power which could change the world!
