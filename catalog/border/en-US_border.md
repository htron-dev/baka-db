## Sinopse

College student Seita can't help but be interested in the "beautiful onee-san" who rescues his friend, Sakurai, from trouble. However, the woman in question has a terrible secret that cannot be dealt with by any ordinary means... A border-less story that begins with, of all things, an apple?!
