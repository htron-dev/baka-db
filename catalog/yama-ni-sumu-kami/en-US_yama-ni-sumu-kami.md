## Sinopse

Atop the mountain, there lived a deity with a tiger in his household. A fair maiden ventured alone... to see the deity of the mountain.

The head of a village plagued by a man-eating tiger offers his daughter Hyeon-na to any man who successfully disposes of the tiger. Dismayed at being treated as a trophy, Hyeon-na sets out alone to the mountain where the tiger lives...
