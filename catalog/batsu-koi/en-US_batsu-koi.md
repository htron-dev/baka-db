## Sinopse

If your pure and romantic loves just end up messy, then you should just indulge in shallow relations for relief! At least, that's what female lawyer Kahori thinks, but then due to unforeseen circumstances, she finds herself at a crossroad in life... Is it possible for an independent female lawyer nearing her 30s to find love?
