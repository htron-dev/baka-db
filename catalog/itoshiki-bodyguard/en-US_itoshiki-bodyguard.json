    "sinopse": "Dara helps her godfather, Harrison, with his campaigns for a U.S. presidential election. Being blessed with beauty and intelligence, she soon gains popularity as Harrison's poster girl. But it also means she is a target of political enemies. Therefore, Harrison hires one of the best bodyguards for her-- Ridge Jackson. Dara is stunned when she sees his shadowy gold eyes. How seductive he is... Isn't it more dangerous to be with this sexy guy than to be a target of political rivalry?\n\n(Source: MU)",
