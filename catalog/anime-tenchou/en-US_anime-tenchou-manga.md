## Sinopse

This is the Animation Store Manager!!

Anizawa Meito is the blazing store manager. He is a fireball who loves animation merchandise at heart. He takes over the dying wish of the former store manager, though still alive, who was attacked by the rival store and becomes a "store manager" of newly opened animation goods specialty store, Animate. The scarlet, "store manager visor" is his trademark.
