## Sinopse

The story centers around a girl named Natasha during the war in Japan. She is a half-European and half-Japanese. She has incredible voice and excels at singing. Moreover, she is also the long-lost daughter of the Japanese baron, who sent an extremely talented musician, Kaoru Sanjou, to find Natasha in Shanghai. These two fell madly in love and went through many obstacles during the feudal war in order to be together. A great story about love, passion, hatred and war.
