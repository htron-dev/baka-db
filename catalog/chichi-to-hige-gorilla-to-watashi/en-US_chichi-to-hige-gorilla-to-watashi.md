## Sinopse

After losing her mother to a traffic accident, five-year-old tomboy Michiru finds a "suspicious person" moving into her home: her father's younger brother Kouji, whom she quickly nicknames "Beard Gorilla." While awkward at first, it doesn't take long for them to develop a relationship that's closer to one between a brother and sister than an uncle and niece.
