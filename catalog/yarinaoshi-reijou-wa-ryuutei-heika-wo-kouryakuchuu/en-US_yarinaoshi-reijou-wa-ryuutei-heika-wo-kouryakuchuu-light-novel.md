## Sinopse

After suffering a combination of detainment, a broken engagement, and execution, Jill thought she was dead... However, her time got rewound to six years ago, when she was but ten, just about to be engaged with the prince.

Jill, who knew what will happen six years later, was eager to change her fate. The face didn't matter—she would marry another man. Unfortunately, it was the young emperor of the neighboring country—who would fall into darkness six years later—who responded to her.
