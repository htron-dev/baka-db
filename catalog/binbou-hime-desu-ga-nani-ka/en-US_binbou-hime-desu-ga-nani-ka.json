    "sinopse": "Midorigafuji Academy is the most prestigious all-girls school for the richest of families. Your performance here heavily influences your social status and money speaks louder than words on the campus. Kurenogi Kirie is the queen bee of the academy. Her family is one of the richest families in the world and, because of that, Kirie has an extreme case of princess mentality: she is arrogant and abuses her power. She believes that money can literally grant her anything and looks down on everybody, even her friends Saito Misaki and Goto Mayura. But when she learns that the family business goes bankrupt, it flips her life upside down and Kirie learns the hard way that karma always comes back.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
