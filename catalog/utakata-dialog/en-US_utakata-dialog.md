## Sinopse

Utagawa and Katano are high school students working part-time at a drugstore in their local shopping mall. Their lives are pretty normal, there's no burning romance, saving the world with magic powers, aiming for a high school sports championship, or getting summoned into an alternate world to defeat the demon king. Just two students wasting their days at their job with a hint of attraction and a dose of comedy.
