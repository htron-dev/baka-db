    "sinopse": "Najaran is a young woman who just happens to be an apprentice Cepter. Cepters have the power to summon creatures from magical cards. Once, these cards were collected in a book called the \"Culdcept.\" During an ancient battle, the book was destroyed—its cards scattered far and wide. Najaran's master gives her a dangerous mission—she must obtain information about the Black Cepters and their nefarious plans. If the Black Cepters rebuild the Culdcept, the arcane book of ages past will grant them unspeakable God-like powers!\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
