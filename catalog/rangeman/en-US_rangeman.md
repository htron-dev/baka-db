## Sinopse

Oozuka Renji or Da-Zhong Lian-er is a high school student who has been looking for love for a long time. Unfortunately, none of the 100 girls he confessed to so far have returned his feelings. Each of them also unintentionally left him with tears. Meanwhile his schoolmates are more interested about a young star in the magazines, which renji surprisingly didn't pay any intention whatsoever. Who will be the girl for him, if ever finds someone?
