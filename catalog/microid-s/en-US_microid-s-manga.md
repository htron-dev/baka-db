## Sinopse

This is a high-tension science-fiction action story about a battle between an insect army corps planning to exterminate humans, and the three insect men who try to stop it.

A highly advanced form of insect, Gidron, builds a giant empire deep under the ground of the Arizona Desert in America, and plans an invasion to purge the earth from pollution-producing humans. A microid, Yanma, who was enslaved by Gidron, escapes from the nest with Ageha and Mamezo in order to alarm humans of the imminent danger. The microid is an intermediate creature classified between insect and human beings. Though the microid and humans share the same ancestor, the microid has been miniaturized and developed after being raised by insects. After their arrival in Japan, however, the warning given by Yanma and other microids is heeded only by Nobel Prize winner and scholar Dr. Midoro and his son, Manabu.

In the meantime, the insects begin to stage their offence: a large number of insects lead by Jugger, elder brother of Yanma, commence their attack on the humans. Human bodies are piling up everywhere, and towns are rapidly brought to ruin.
