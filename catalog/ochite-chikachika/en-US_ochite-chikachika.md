## Sinopse

When Mimi is scouted as a reader model, she's excited for the opportunity to meet super-popular male model Ryota. The only problem is, Ryota is nothing like what she expected. So why did he pick her to model alongside him in an upcoming project? Is this the start of her modelling career, or just a big mistake?
