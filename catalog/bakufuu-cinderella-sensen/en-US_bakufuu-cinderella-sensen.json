    "sinopse": "Hinazato Tsugumi, a normal girl, accidentally got picked as Miss Madonna for the Shiratori Girls School, a very select girls high school for the rich. Anyways, so now Tsugumi, a girl from a middle class background is attending Shiratori and trying to adjust to being the centre of attention amidst all of these high-class people. Of course, she's not ashamed of her background, she's very high-spirited and cheerful. Takaomi, a slacker from the private boys' school next-door, is exactly the opposite-apathetic, and always napping outside. How will they deal with each other? (Source: MangaUpdates)",
