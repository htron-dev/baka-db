    "sinopse": "In this story set in the early 1980s, a young man dreams of becoming a renowned comic writer in years to come. His name is Honoo Moyuru. He has no money, only a dream. Then, he feels overwhelmed by his lack of ability, and buys some sake, although he has no head or stomach for alcohol. This is a tortured elegy for any dashing young art student who spends his days careening around in burning ambition.",
