    "sinopse": "This story takes place in a world where humans and beastmen coexist. Our protagonist, a dog beastman, was a former gangster who's fallen on hard times, living on the streets and scraping by on what he can get. On one particular rainy day, he tries to fall asleep in an alley before being found by an eccentric \"Yamato Nadesico\" type of girl. She offers him a home to sleep in, in exchange for him becoming her bodyguard. He doesn't think much of it until he sees her home and it's explained to him by the servants in it that she's the daughter of a Yakuza boss and has a sadistic personality. On top of all that, almost all her servants are beastmen as well!\n\n(Source: MU)",
