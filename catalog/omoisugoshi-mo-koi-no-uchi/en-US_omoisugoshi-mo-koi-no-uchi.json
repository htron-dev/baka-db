    "sinopse": "\"I am not gay!\" shouts Kishida suddenly to Hino, who just broke up with his boyfriend and who tries to pick up KIshida up at a gay bar. Kishida was just there because he was concerned about his nephew in high school who he thought might be seeing another boy. He wanted to be able to be there for his nephew should he need to ever talk about anything... Hino was more than willing to help the new object of his interest, the serious, innocent Kishida, but...? In addition to this main pairing, we also have Yoshinari x Akio too! A gorgeous sequel just hot off the press!",
