## Sinopse

Newly hired Mitsuha has an email friend 'Chief' whom he met through a gay dating website. Suddenly he has this funny feeling that his on-line buddy is none other than his boss in real life: the serious, strict, four-eyed Chief Azuchi. Thus starts a rather complicated “Love Untouchable".
