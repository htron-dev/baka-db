## Sinopse

Inuwashi Momo, a lovely and delicate girl living with her handsome brothers who dearly take care of her since their parents death. Of course, she loves them... maybe too much...

In order to protect her kingdom, Momo acts lovely, puts GPS to track them and does whatever it takes to get rid of girls interested in her brothers like a soldier. But one day, Momo meets a boy who wants to overthrow her perfect kingdom.
