## Sinopse

In the distant future, the earth was captured by the sudden invasion of aliens and the weapons they unleashed - "mechanical life forms."
Mankind fled to the moon, developed android soldiers, and organized resistance forces. A long battle continued for years. In 11941 AD, in order to gain a upper hand in the war, a new female type android unit "YoRHa" was formed and sent to the front lines on Earth to recapture the planet for mankind. What is the future of these androids that fight only to accomplish that purpose?
