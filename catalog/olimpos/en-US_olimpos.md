## Sinopse

Ganymedes is a revered, handsome Trojan prince. His beauty has not gone unnoticed by the gods. The day of his coming of age parade, Ganymedes is abducted by Apollon, the sun god.

Ganymedes awakens in a foreign place, surrounded by pure-white flowers and an endless, star-filled sky. Apollon reappears and informs Ganymedes that he’s imprisoned in the Garden of the Gods. For what purpose is he being kept there?
