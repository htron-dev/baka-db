    "sinopse": "Ganymedes is a revered, handsome Trojan prince. His beauty has not gone unnoticed by the gods. The day of his coming of age parade, Ganymedes is abducted by Apollon, the sun god.\n\nGanymedes awakens in a foreign place, surrounded by pure-white flowers and an endless, star-filled sky. Apollon reappears and informs Ganymedes that he’s imprisoned in the Garden of the Gods. For what purpose is he being kept there?\n\n(Source: shinkeikaku)",
