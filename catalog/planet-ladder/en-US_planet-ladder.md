## Sinopse

Kaguya is a quiet orphan who has lived with a Japanese family since she was a little girl. Another boring high school day becomes the adventure of her life when she's mysteriously transported far, far away to a realm of strangers who call her "Princess." Now, Princess Kaguya must uncover both her true identity and the motives behind the battling warlords who want to claim her. The universe is a battlefield, and the key to peace may be in the hands of one very special girl.
