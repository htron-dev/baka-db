## Sinopse

Three months have passed since Princess Mina, queen of all vampires, has recaptured the Bund. The damage inflicted to vampire/human relations runs deep, but a peaceful postwar restoration is now underway.

Yet appearances can be deceiving. Somebody is trying to kill government liaison Reiko Gotoh, but her lycanthrope bodyguard, Seiji Hama, is nowhere to be found. The mystery of Hama's whereabouts can only be solved by examining the past, when the ill-fated couple first met. The past may be the key to saving Gotoh in the present—and to the future of the Vampire Bund itself!
