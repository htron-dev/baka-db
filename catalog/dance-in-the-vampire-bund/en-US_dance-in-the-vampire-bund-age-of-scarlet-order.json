    "sinopse": "Vampire hunts rage across the United States like the witch hunts of old. But in the shadows, rumors whisper of a grand escape plan. \"Mina Tepes summons all the vampires of America,\" it says. \"Reach the West Coast, and a ship will take you all to the Vampire Bund.\" Desperate to survive, hordes of vampires follow that rumor and make for the West Coast. There's only one small problem—the Vampire Bund sunk months ago, and Vampire Queen Mina Tepes is dead.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
