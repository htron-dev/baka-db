## Sinopse

First year ace pitcher Natsu Haigou is only 3 outs away from bringing Houmiya High School to Koshien for the first time in 60 years. But when a rain delay is called, lightning strikes the stadium, and Natsu is sent back in time to the summer of 1959, the same year that his grandfather lead Houmiya to the school's first ever Koshien victory.
