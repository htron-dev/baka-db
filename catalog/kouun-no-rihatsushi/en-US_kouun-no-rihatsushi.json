    "sinopse": "Suffering from unrequited love, Todou Tsukasa, also called \"the moody pillar,\" walks into a barbershop. The cheerful barber not only gives him a sexy new haircut, but also advice on how to better carry himself. Tsukasa takes that advice to heart and goes on to fame and success. But he never forgets the barber who helped him when he needed it, and keeps dropping by. However, confidence didn't come along with the new haircut nor the fame and success, and his feelings are neither conveyed nor understood well.\n\n(Source: MU)",
