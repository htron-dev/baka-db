    "sinopse": "Seriu Ichiro has always been in the shadow of his older sister, Rei, who did great things as the student body president in her high school. Although he was the student body president at his middle school, he was sick of the responsibility and wanted to live free. That’s when Ichiro decides to attend Yashio Academy, literally a brand new school, where his class would be the first ever class of the school which meant a fresh start for Ichiro. He meets a fellow school mate, Hatsuse Sakuno, on the way to Yashio and as soon as the two walk through the school gate, it's announced that he is the new student body president. As much as he tries to fight fate, he soon accepts the position of student body president on one condition: that Sakuno acts as co-president.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
