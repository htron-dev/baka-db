## Sinopse

Meldina hates humans, and wants nothing to do with them. Since her parents' deaths, she has desired to live surrounded by machines, and everyone in town thinks she's a weirdo. One day, she meets a big machine that she names Machina and treats it as a friend. Her meeting Machina, as well as meeting a potential friend in a girl named Alisa, kicks off a series of events that bring to light dangerous secrets about herself and about her parents' deaths.
