## Sinopse

Kurosaki Sou is a 16-year-old who summons a devil to take his virginity. He hopes for a devil with flaming red hair, large horns, and black wings. He gets exactly what he wishes for, although he forgets something else rather important. Now he's forced to live with this devil and has to think of a way to get rid of it, and most importantly—survive its lust.
