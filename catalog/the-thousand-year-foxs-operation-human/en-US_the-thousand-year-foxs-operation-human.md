## Sinopse

The prince of heaven is punished after defiling a thousand girls!

Meanwhile, a nine-tailed fox has always wanted to be human. She's waited a thousand years to have a flowery romance on earth. However, when she gets there--surrounded by manic obsessive school-girls, she realizes earth isn't what she's always dreamed of. Especially when there's a boy named "Cha Ga-Un" who ultimately gives heartache to all the girls he meets!
