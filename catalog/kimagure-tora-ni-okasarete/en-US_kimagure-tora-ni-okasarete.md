## Sinopse

Tomoya is working at a host club when he unexpectedly comes face to face with a nightmare from his past. After his first two traumatizing experiences with Murase, Tomoya finds his third encounter intoxicating as he's drawn deeper into Murase's dangerous life. Will Tomoya find a way for their two worlds to coexist, or will Murase's dark past consume them both?
