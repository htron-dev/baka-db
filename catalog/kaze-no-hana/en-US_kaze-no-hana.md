## Sinopse

Orphaned four years ago by an accident that took her parents and her memory, 16 year-old Momoka Futami travels to Mitsurugi City upon receiving an invitation from the Mitsurugi House, her father's very powerful relatives who offer to take her in. What awaits her far exceeds her fears and expectations-a spiritual sword, Suzukaze, and a tumultuous battle.
