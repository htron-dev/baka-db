## Sinopse

Ichino is a high school girl who absolutely hate guys due to the fact that her father betrayed them when she was young; stealing all the valuables that she & her mother possessed & disappearing without a trace. Since then she has vowed to become strong so she would not lose to any man. She has also longed for the day she could meet the lady from a fateful encounter in her childhood.

One day, she accidentally beat up a guy who she mistook as a pervert pestering her friend, Miyabi. She tries to apologize but ends up beating him up even more.... She developed a distaste for the guy and two of his friends as they bump into each other once again resulting in more misunderstandings. Ichino personally believed that if she came across the same person thrice that would be considered 'fate'...

Coincidentally, the start of her school begun with a surprise as she found out that all THREE of them turned out to be her new classmates!!
