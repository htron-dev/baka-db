Since then she has vowed to become strong so she would not lose to any man. She has also longed for the day she could meet the lady from a fateful encounter in her childhood.\n\nOne day, she accidentally beat up a guy who she mistook as a pervert pestering her friend, Miyabi. She tries to apologize but ends up beating him up even more.... She developed a distaste for the guy and two of his friends as they bump into each other once again resulting in more misunderstandings. Ichino personally believed that if she came across the same person thrice that would be considered 'fate'...\n\nCoincidentally, the start of her school begun with a surprise as she found out that all THREE of them turned out to be her new classmates!!\n\n(Source: Shoujo Crusade)",
