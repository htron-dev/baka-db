## Sinopse

Kokoro is a girl that works with her two older sisters at a library with the same name at hers. The problem is that the library is far away from the nearast town so people seldom come to the library. Follow Kokoro and her sisters as they try to uphold the legacy of their father.

It's a lighthearted, slice-of-life manga.
