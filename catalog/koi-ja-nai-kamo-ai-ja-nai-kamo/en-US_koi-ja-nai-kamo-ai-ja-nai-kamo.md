## Sinopse

It's love at first sight for Kanai's friend Kouki, but nothing but trouble for him. Not only is Takashi Kanai being hit on by plenty of guys at his university, he now has to deal with his best friend crushing on his older brother. Kanai is in a state of confusion after hearing about Kouki's new found feelings, and he doesn't know what's got him totally out of sorts. Mix in his brother’s shifty friend, who seems to like Kanai a tad too much, and there’s just no telling what will happen to his relationship with Kouki.
