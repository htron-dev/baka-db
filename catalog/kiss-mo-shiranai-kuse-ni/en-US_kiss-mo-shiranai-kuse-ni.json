    "sinopse": "High school freshman Souta Fujisawa was molested in a train one morning. However, that was only a misunderstanding on his part, and he eventually found out that it was only a tennis racket. The one who informed him was Chihiro Ayase, the transfer student who started a month late. It was awkward between the two of them at first, but they gradually became closer.\n\n(Source: Taiyo Tosho, translated)",
