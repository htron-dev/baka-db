## Sinopse

Chihiro Ayase and Sota Fujisawa are lovers. They like each other, kiss each other, and touch each other often. When they decide they want to experience something better, they find that the reality is that sex isn’t as easy as it seems. Chihiro and Sota are scared to go further, and they’ve even been interrupted during their attempts! But even though some obstacles stand in the way of their goal, they still share the same love.
