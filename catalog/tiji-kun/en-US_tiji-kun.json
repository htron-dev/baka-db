Because of this, the students are constantly robbed and harassed by yakuza, gangs, etc. In order to ensure the students' safety, the Student Council came up with one solution: befriend the legendary \"Tiji-kun\", the strongest man in Kabukichō. Two students, Motobu Tomoko and Akazawa Ryo, were assigned the task.
