## Sinopse

Hanagasumi Highschool is located right in middle of Kabukichō, Tokyo's #1 red-light district. Because of this, the students are constantly robbed and harassed by yakuza, gangs, etc. In order to ensure the students' safety, the Student Council came up with one solution: befriend the legendary "Tiji-kun", the strongest man in Kabukichō. Two students, Motobu Tomoko and Akazawa Ryo, were assigned the task. But when they find out the true identity of the mysterious "Tiji-kun", having a peaceful school-life turns out to be harder than it seems.
