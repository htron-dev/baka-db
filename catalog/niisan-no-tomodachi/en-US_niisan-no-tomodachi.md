## Sinopse

Things get awkward at home for Nozomu when his mother marries a new man. One day Nozomu meets his brother's friend from high school, Fujiyama. Fujiyama is not only handsome and good at cooking, but also very kind and doting. Fujiyama says to Nozomu "Would you go out with me? Let me take care of you" and Nozomu says yes.
