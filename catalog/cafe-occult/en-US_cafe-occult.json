She is saved by a young man, and he takes her back to the cafe. There her fears are confirmed; she was killed by the car, and has now become a spirit. Cafe Occult, the Master, its 'errand boy' Young, are all mysteriously connected to both the world of the living and the spirit world. Suh Rin's spirit is wanted for a reason unknown, and only Young and his special bullets can keep her from their grasp.",
