    "sinopse": "The Mondlicht (German for Moonlight) are vampires who are unable to go out in daylight and are only able to live by feeding on the blood of humans. However, they're also mostly just frightened children on their own, trying to survive without killing anyone or being hunted out of existence. Doing this was hard enough, before an artificial human created by Dr. Frankenstein named F08 started to find them and tried to destroy them all. However, in F08's first fight, the girl she calls her big sister turns on her after killing the boy leading the Mondlicht. Whose side is she on? Why does she have wings just like the vampires she's supposed to be hunting? Can the Mondlicht ever live in peace?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
