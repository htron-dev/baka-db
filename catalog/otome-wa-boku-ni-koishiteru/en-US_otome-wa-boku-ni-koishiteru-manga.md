## Sinopse

Mizuho can't believe his ears when Grandpa's will is read out. Grandpa's final wish is for Mizuho to attend the same academy as Mizuho's mother. The catch is it's an all-girls school. With the help of his friend Mariya however, he gets a makeover good enough to fool everyone at the academy.
