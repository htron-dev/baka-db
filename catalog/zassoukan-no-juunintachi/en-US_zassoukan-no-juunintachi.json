    "sinopse": "Oozeki Arata is a first year high school student who has to find new living arrangements after his parents move overseas. Arata moves into Zassoukan, which contains four other residents. The other residents look at this newcomer suspiciously and appear to be hiding something. Arata soon discovers that they are all mangaka hiding their identities for various reasons.\n\nThere's Hayashi Erika, an elementary school teacher who draws shota manga and shamelessly declares that she loves cute, small boys. Sakura Kanako is a 10 year old girl that draws graphic H manga and is enchanted by large breasted women, including Erika. Odaka Hitoha, Arata's classmate, draws \"nonfiction\" BL manga, which means all of his material comes from personal experiences with different men he chases down, which apparently includes the final resident. Irisuna Fuzuki is a seemingly normal man in his late twenties that works as a shoujo magazine editor, except he also draws a popular shoujo manga for the competition.\n\nSince Arata knows everyone's secret, they decide to make him an assistant. Will Arata be okay?\n\n(Source: shinkeikaku)",
