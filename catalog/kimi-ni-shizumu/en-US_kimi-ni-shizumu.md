## Sinopse

Love? Family? Belonging? Takata tells himself he doesn't need them; a gay man like him can't have them.

Seno despises shameless Takata. Whenever Takata enters the coffee shop, Seno grits his teeth, barely manages to greet him, and tries not to think about how Takata destroyed his boss's marriage. But Seno makes a horrible assumption: he pins the cruel heart on the wrong man. His strong feelings morph into something more complicated than disgust. Can Seno convince Takata that creating a family doesn't rely on being "gay" or "straight"?
