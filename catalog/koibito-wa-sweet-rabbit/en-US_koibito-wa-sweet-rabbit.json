    "sinopse": "A collection of one-shots bridging the gap between shotacon and mainstream BL. While the uke in this collection are ridiculously adorable and childlike, they're far from victims. In fact, they do the lion's share of the seducing. In her first commercial BL publication, Miroku-sensei blurs the line between actual innocence and acting the part to get what you want.\n\n1. Egoistic Lovely\n   2-3. Loving You School Life\n2. Lover is a Sweet Rabbit",
