    "sinopse": "Chitose Aoyagi is a returnee from France. At his new school, he's reunited with Tasuke Akayuge, his childhood nemesis... a traumatic trigger he wishes he'd never have to deal with again! Why traumatic, you ask? In 4th grade, Tasuke not only stole the coveted Gad Red role in the school play, but he was the pervert who stole Chitose's first kiss! In Chitose's mind,\"he's not 'Red' at all!\" But, Tasuke quickly becomes popular and even gets chummy with Chitose's best friend, then professes his feelings for Chitose and does dirty things to him! Chitose feels all mixed up and doesn't know what to do...!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
