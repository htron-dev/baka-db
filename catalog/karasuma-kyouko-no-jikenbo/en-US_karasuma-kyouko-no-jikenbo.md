## Sinopse

After 2050, Tokyo. The sixteen-year-old gifted police detective Kyouko Karasuma works for a special devision in the Asakusa Police Department. Her rather abnormal cases involve: fighting oni, tengu, and other monsters from Asian myths and legends. The modern art by the character designer of Speed Grapher works very well with the action-heavy story line and the overall art improves with each volume.
