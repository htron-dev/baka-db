## Sinopse

After defeating Geese, Terry resumes his life of fighting and is forgotten by Southtown. Gangsters roam the streets and death is common place; the residents have little to hope for. With little reason to celebrate, the town has degenerated into a fighting pit for some of the world's most dangerous criminals. Terry, rugged and pissed off, battles to bring peace to a hopeless city. A young girl, Media, keeps him optimistic for a better future.
