## Sinopse

There was no real reason. I just really loved him… Kagerou and Ata, although unrelated, live together under one roof like a family. Kagerou has a pure heart while Ata is very sensitive and always appears to be in love. These two are close like brothers and far from lovers and yet... this it is their love story.
