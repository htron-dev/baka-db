Asuka is a typical high school girl with two big loves in her life: Judo, and Kujyo-senpai. One day, Asuka finally gathers up her nerve to confess her feelings to Kujyo-senpai. But before she can do so, a boy from her past transfers to her school and challenges Asuka to a judo match--if he wins, Asuka will have to be his girlfriend for three months. Who is this boy? Will Asuka ever get a chance to confess to Kujyo-senpai? Who will win this match?
