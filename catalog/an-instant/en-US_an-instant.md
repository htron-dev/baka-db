## Sinopse

Azuru Isshikiâ€™s animated short An Instant, pares the art of animation down to its essentials: A series of images drawn in paint on paper. It begins and ends with a small dot, but in-between Isshiki explores the full range of expression possible with just simple animation tools. The film consists of just black and red paint on a variety of different papers. Dots, lines, and spirals dance across the screen, as does a cheerful female figure.
