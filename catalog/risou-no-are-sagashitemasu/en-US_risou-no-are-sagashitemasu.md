## Sinopse

At a rather salacious masquerade party where VIPs and celebrities alike have gathered, businessman Kamiya encounters a magic wand he can't forget! Hoping to once again submit himself to its magical abilities, Kamiya recruits the help of his ever-present stone-faced secretary, Tachibana, to find the mystery man who possesses it. Just who is the man behind the mask with the wand from beyond, and does Kamiya have a chance of finding him?
