Already uneasy about his position in the eyes of his disapproving father, it doesn't help when Takahiro gets himself kidnapped by American gangsters. While his captors wait for the ransom demand to be met, Takahiro has to while away the days under the watchful eyes of his assigned guard, Jack. As the days turn into weeks, something like friendship develops between them. But will it lead to more...?\n\n(Source: Liquid Passion)",
