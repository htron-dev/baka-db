    "sinopse": "One day, a new servant arrives to work for Princess Pearl of Aldun. With both a handsome appearance and an exotic air, he calls himself “Genie,” the same name as the spirit of the lamp from Arabian Nights. Pearl is captivated by his cool demeanor and his face like a foreign prince, but his prideful bearing makes him seem something other than the servant he claims to be.\n\n(Source: Jmanga)",
