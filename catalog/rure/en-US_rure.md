## Sinopse

Ha-Ru is the daughter of a family that rules a remote island--she is also the heiress to this secluded land, something that Ha-Ru's half sister, Mi-Ru, resents. When Mi-Ru becomes upset and runs away, Ha-Ru follows her--and magically they are ushered into a foreign desert! And in this land, it's survival of the fittest! (Source: Tokyopop)
