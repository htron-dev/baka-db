## Sinopse

Itonaga was bullied during middle school because he had unusually small eyes which gradually made him socially awkward. At college, when he finally thought of starting things anew, he came across his ex-bully, Sanada, popular and sociable.

With his dark past coming to haunt his present, he tries to avoid Sanada at first but finally gives up. But things unexpectedly took a shocking turn soon after? What are Sanada's true intentions? What is he really aiming at?
