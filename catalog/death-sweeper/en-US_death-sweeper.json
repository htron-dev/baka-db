Through interactions between the deceased's family and friends with the death sweepers, we understand the meaning of death. No matter is it is a peaceful death at the ends of one's life, murder, suicide, death from illnesses, when death comes, who would be able to predict it, or prevent it? That is why we have to try our best to live on.\n\n(Source: MU)",
