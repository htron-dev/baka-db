    "sinopse": "I was bullied by everyone, so in return I'm going to slaughter them all.\n\nTaking inspiration from the 31 days of the calendar, the uber popular girl group Calendrier was formed. Behind the bubbly appearance, in the shadows, there is one member that is bullied by the others on a daily face. \"If you can't smile, then neither will the fans.\"\nShe is willing to do anything to regain the smile that was robbed by her group mates.\n\nWith 30 members as her opponents, this is the story of the crazy number 31.\n\n(Source: Square Enix, translated)",
