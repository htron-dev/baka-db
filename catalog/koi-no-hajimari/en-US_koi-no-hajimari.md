## Sinopse

Average-looking, always speaks-her-mind Hachiya Nanami just wants a boyfriend that likes her for her—preferably the school's popular soccer star, Mizuno. As their best friends start dating, they immediately find that they, too have a lot in common. This is the perfect chance for Hachiya to finally score her dream guy. But does Mizuno feel the same way?
