## Sinopse

Momo Adachi struggles with insecurities about her tanned skin daily, which is only worsened by her high school peers. Moreover, the girl who Momo treats as her best friend, Sae Kashiwagi, is the most vicious of them all—spreading hateful lies and scheming evil plans to ensure Momo does not outshine her.

Unfortunately for Momo, she is about to face a tremendously difficult battle when Sae realizes that the two most attractive guys in school have feelings for her. Can Momo keep her long time crush, Kazuya "Touji" Toujigamori, by her side despite Sae's attempts to tear them apart?
