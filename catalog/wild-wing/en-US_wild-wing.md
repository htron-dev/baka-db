## Sinopse

Miyabi literally lives in an ivory tower. Protected and watched over by servants all her life, she dreams of what's beyond the wall that surrounds and protects the city she lives in. One day, Miyabi finds herself on the other side of the wall. Will she find the monsters everyone speaks of? Or will she find something else...?

Note: Was originally a one shot in Shiro LaLa, but was continued a year later in LaLa DX.
