    "sinopse": "Greek millionaire Leon Gregoris had been like a brother to Bea Stephen since childhood, and on her eighteenth birthday they got engaged. But only a little while later, she discovered he was unfaithful and she broke it off. Three years have passed since then, and now that Leon has assumed his father's role as copartner at Stephen & Gregoris, he's come back for her. Just remembering the humiliation makes Bea angry, but Leon doesn't care—the first thing he does is kiss her in front of everyone at her twenty-first birthday party!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
