    "sinopse": "My Young Cat and My Old Dog is a collection of short, heartwarming, and episodic stories that describe the relationships between the old poodle Nang-nak, the cute kitten Soondae, and their loving owners. Some stories are autobiographical—telling the artist's own experience with his pets—while others are told from the pets' point of view in an interesting, fresh, and innocent take on storytelling.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
