Amongst the fighting and confusion, he meets the leader of an anti-government guerrilla organization, John, and they end up helping each another. Why is it that John, who has placed himself on the front lines, seems to age and rejuvenate every time Maeda looks at him? A story of life and death on the battlefield.\n\n(Source: Akaneshinsha, translated)",
