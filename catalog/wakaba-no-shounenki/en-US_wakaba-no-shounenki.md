## Sinopse

Cool, friendly Mariya is the undisputed king of his year! But why does he always hang around with shy and painfully awkward "Mr. Mannequin" Nachi? Can these boys withstand the non-stop judgment of a school filled with jealous rivals and confused classmates?

A New Season of Young Leaves follows every sweet high and lonely low in the growing relationship of unlikely best friends. How will the most popular guy in class deal when his wallflower confidant suddenly steals the social spotlight...and a beautiful girl's affection?
