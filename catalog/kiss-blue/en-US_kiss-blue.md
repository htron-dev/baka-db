## Sinopse

When Tomosaka realized he was in love with his best friend Noda, it seemed the most natural thing in the world. He couldn't even remember when he'd first started falling in love. He had his feelings, but he couldn't express them... because Noda was his best friend. A story about the delicate thread that separates friendship and love.
