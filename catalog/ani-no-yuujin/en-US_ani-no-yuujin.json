    "sinopse": "Kei's older brother just recently passed away, leaving Kei with a large inheritance. When his mother relinquishes his brother's tablet to him, Kei is surprised to find pictures of his brother and his friend and former schoolmate, Akinari being intimate with each other—in a relationship. Kei reminiscences his memories of the two: his admiration for both his brother and Akinari, in two different contexts. Kei decides to visit Akinari to confront him. Reunited, Kei realizes that his feelings for Akinari are more than just childish admiration. But Kei also realizes that his brother's ghost will always continue to linger in everything around him.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
