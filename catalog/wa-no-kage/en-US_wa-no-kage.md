What is known about this nation is that they have been able to preserve their small nation in so small part to their advanced understanding of the "Corona Solids," which have been utilized to build an array of creations, most notably the "hakukai armour," which enables its user to enhance their natural ability, as well as create weapons out of this special creation.
