## Sinopse

Although he is a talented modern dancer, Regis is plowing through a creative slump for his dance troupe's Christmas performance. But, no matter what he does, Regis can't perform to his perfectionist standards. Frustrated, Regis first lashes out at his dance partner and then seeks the bodily comfort of his step-brother, fellow dancer, roommate Yuui. Intertwined with Yuui's life and body, can Regis find a release from his past and pain? This volume also includes stories about members in Regis and Yuui's dance troupe.
