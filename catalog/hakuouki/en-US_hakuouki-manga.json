    "sinopse": "Based originally on the famous otome game, this series is Ninomiya Sachi's version of Yukimura Chizuru's story as she arrives in Kyo from Edo to search for her missing father and accidentally meets the members of the Shinsengumi, who harbor an awful secret. Unique from other versions, this series unfolds a bit out of order, starting already at the Ikedaya-jiken and then progressing with flashbacks.",
