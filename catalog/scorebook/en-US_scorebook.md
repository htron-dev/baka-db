## Sinopse

Honma Kusuko has wanted to reach Koshien since she was a child. Since girls can't play in high school baseball matches, she decided to make it there as a manager. One day she finds the baseball club's only two members and tells them that she will bring with her, as manager, five new members to keep them from being disbanded. That those five members happen to be animals is, to the woman who would become the number one baseball manager in all of Japan, not a problem.
