## Sinopse

Hunky underclassman Makoto Oribe confessed to college student Hiromi Tanzawa. Half joking, Hiromi responded, “Why don’t you try catching me if you love me!” One day, Hiromi suddenly wakes up...in Oribe’s room! With shackles on his feet, Hiromi’s obviously confined but Oribe rushes to reassure him he won’t do anything until Hiromi loves him back. Unexpectedly stubborn, Hiromi sets one rule: “If you make a move on me, you have to let me go.” Ready to attack using any means necessary to get free, Hiromi realizes Oribe is actually really determined to win...and thinks, “I might be in serious trouble at this rate!?”

An explosive, tension-filled love with one-shots included.
