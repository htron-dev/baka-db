Midori just moved in with her father in a new town. Nervous about her new school and thinking back that she's well known among her friends that she cried easily, she promised herself that this time she will be strong and won't cry easily anymore. However, when she introduced herself to the class, she noticed that there's no one in her class is a girl. Midori's shocked and wondered why. Before anything happened, a fight between a teacher and a student in her class shocked her even more.
