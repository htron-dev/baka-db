## Sinopse

"I want to protect this little cutie!" I wished for that so hard, but that kid, Rui Hanamine, just continued to grow and grow and grow until I, Yuujirou Matsukaze began to worry. I've already realized these feelings I have for my 180-some centimeter childhood friend, but...

A story of a short but manly guy vs. a large but fluffy and cute childhood friend.
