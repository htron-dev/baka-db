## Sinopse

Suwa is perfect. She has perfect grades, perfect looks and is the idol of everyone at her school. However this "perfection" has created an odd distance between her and her fellow classmates. That is except for Takeda, the boy who sits in front of her in class. It seems Takeda is the only person that is able to speak to Suwa normally and much to her chagrin he is starting to think she is not all that perfect.
