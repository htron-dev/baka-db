## Sinopse

The dream of the sharp-tongued and mischievous schoolgirl Mari is to become a housewife by the age of 20. Pretending to be a lady, she is trying to find herself the perfect husband for this purpose. And then the super-popular musician Aoi unexpectedly proposes to her! "Let's me marry you, and you, in return, become my vocalist." A calculating ulcer high school student and a genius musician-dunce: a love comedy about a completely incompatible couple begins!
