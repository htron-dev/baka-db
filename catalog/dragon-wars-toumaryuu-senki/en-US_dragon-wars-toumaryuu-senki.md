Lufiak Duell is the member of a Dragon Clan, but in order to become a true member he has to find a dragon's scale, and he only has one year to do this. Along the way he meets a fairy named Feenie and finds an orb that contains the soul of the Master Dragon. When he meets the dragons they tell him that a plague known as the Dark Force has been released and is slowly infecting the world. Lufiak joins the dragons in their quest to stop the Dark Force.
