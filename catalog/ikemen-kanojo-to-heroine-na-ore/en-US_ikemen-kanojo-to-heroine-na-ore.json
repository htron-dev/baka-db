    "sinopse": "Ever since birth, Haruma Ichinose has been a very popular boy. Blessed with charming looks, he has allured most of the girls' attention toward him. However, this attention is taken away by Yuki Mogami, a tall girl in his class. Despite being female, Yuki holds princely characteristics—endearing, cool, and incredibly handsome—leading Haruma to instantly fall in love with her.\n\nUnwilling to acknowledge his own feelings, Haruma claims to be overly annoyed at Yuki's captivating looks. Wanting to prove that he is cooler than her, he puts on a masculine demeanor to make her fall for him. But the more he attempts to attract Yuki, the more he appears as a heroine to her! Will Haruma's efforts ever reach the oblivious prince charming's heart?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
