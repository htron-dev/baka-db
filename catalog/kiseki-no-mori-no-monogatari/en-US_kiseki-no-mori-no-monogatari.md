## Sinopse

On the Grand Duke of Dahlia's land, there is a miracle forest where animals live peacefully. But the Duke orders his men to cut down the trees there. In order to protect the forest, the goddess of miracles transforms a little squirrel into Princess Briarose by magic, and sends her to the Grand Duke of Dahlia. Then the goddess of miracles puts a spell on the real Princess Briarose to change her into a fawn.
