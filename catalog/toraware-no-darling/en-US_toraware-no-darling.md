## Sinopse

Yuriko Shimizu, an office employee, hears the moans of corporeal passion through the wall dividing the next room and hers. In the next room lives Tachibana, a strange writer of detective stories. Taking advantage of her weakness, he tries to persuade her to do all the tricks of lovemaking with him. This is a collection of good amusing stories.
