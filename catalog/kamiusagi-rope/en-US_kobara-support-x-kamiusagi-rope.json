    "sinopse": "A collaboration between Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.'s Kobara Support product and Kamiusagi Rope.\n\nKobara Support is a fruit flavored drink for those with an upset stomach, dieting, or ill. These people would have difficulty eating normal foods so when Kobara Support is drunk on an empty stomach (which is high in acid), a chemical reaction occurs where the stomach acid and the pectin fiber to become carbonated foam. This expands and doubles in volume while turning into jelly. For the drinker, their stomach becomes physically full thus shutting off the hunger receptors letting continue their day without stomach pains.",
