## Sinopse

The "cynical slapstick comedy" one-shot follows the troubles of Rikuto Shindou and his "mother," Shuichi Shindou. Rikuto has grown up without many friends because they always call him a liar after finding out his "mother" is actually a man. Riku is now in high school, and he is freaking out because his mother is supposed to come to school tomorrow for an interview with his teacher. Shuichi then decides to crossdress for the interview.
