    "sinopse": "Kei, a hot transfer student from the U.S., mistakes Yuri for a girl. Even when he realizes Yuri's a guy, he won't stop making passes at him! Yuri's always had a complex about his cute name and appearance, and Kei keeps pushing Yuri's buttons from day one at school! Kei's weirdly attached to Yuri. He's way too touchy-feely, and on top of that, he loves to call Yuri \"cute\"...! One day, they're alone together in the library, and Kei can't resist making a move...! \"I've never been with a guy, either... Wanna try it?\" A handsome, half-Japanese playboy from the U.S. meets a cute-but-ballsy Japanese high-school boy. One just can't seem to say no to the other. A bewildering yet oh-so-sweet teen romance!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
