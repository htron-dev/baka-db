## Sinopse

Engage – a covenant pledged between knight and noble

This is the tale of individuals tied together by the sacred bonds of Engage

Tia is a young girl who hails from the remote regions of the Grunwald Empire. Due to royal decree, she is required to attend a prestigious academy located in the imperial capital. The academy serves not only as a networking spot for the children of aristocracy to meet and rub shoulders, but is also where the paths of nobles and knights cross.

Tia herself is on a mission to find a knight with great promise, however, who she stumbles upon instead is the academy’s problem child – Duran. Due to an encounter with Duran, Tia finds she is able to draw out a knight’s potential, normally only done via Engage. As someone who can call forth the powers of Engage without a pledged covenant, Tia finds herself the target of many knights…
