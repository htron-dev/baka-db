## Sinopse

Nanami Rei has always lived his life in his brother's shadow. He can't talk to girls, he's not athletic, and his grades aren't good. Ren is smart, popular, everything but most importantly, never judged Rei for his faults or lifestyle. But suddenly, Ren loses his mind and he could only shout words in terror about Wonder Rabbit Girl! Rei, seeking out revenge, decides to investigate disguised as Ren. His only clue is his brother's USB drive. There, a list of the schools's girls with names and their fetishes. Rei believes that one of these girls must be Wonder Rabbit Girl.
