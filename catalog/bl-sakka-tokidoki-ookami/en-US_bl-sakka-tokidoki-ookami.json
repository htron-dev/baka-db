    "sinopse": "Chiaki Haruno isn't happy. He thought he got into this company as a literary editor, but it turns out he's going to be editing manga! To make matters worse, he accidentally confides in Yuzuru Houjou, the manga artist he's supposed to work with, and tells him how he's using Yuzuru's manga as a stepping stone to get transferred! Now Chiaki has to beg Yuzuru to keep working with him, and Yuzuru's not letting him off easy. This is a seductive tale of a handsome manga artist and his cute editor that's bound to make your mouth water!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
