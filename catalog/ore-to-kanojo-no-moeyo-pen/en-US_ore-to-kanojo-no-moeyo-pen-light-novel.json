    "sinopse": "In order to polish up my techniques to achieve my goal of professionally debuting as a hot-blooded battle manga artist, I, Kimijima Sen, became the assistant of the pro manga artist Ikigoma Agito-sensei. But... she is a high school girl drawing moe manga that has no relation with the type of manga I'm shooting for!?\n\n\"Tch... why is it a guy!? I heard that it'd be an older gorgeous big-boobs girl!\"\n\nOn top of that, she really loves eroge and has an extreme fetish with beautiful girls and big breasts. Not understanding \"moe,\" under her direction, I started playing eroge to learn more about it. Furthermore, despite being so demanding on guys that she gets easily annoyed at them, she's okay with exposing herself in her underwear...\n\nJeez, what the heck is with her!!\n\nAnd the two of us have to work together to get a manga serialized,\n\n\"You're kidding me right?\"\n\n(Source: Baka-Tsuki)",
