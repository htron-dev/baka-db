## Sinopse

Manga adaption of the CD drama Daisuke!.

The story begins within a small bar, which Daisuke Akagi runs called "Dice." Maybe it's their names fault but in this peculiar little shop part-time worker Daisuke Wakaba, Daisuke Touma and men named "Daisuke" work.

A bar you by chance drop by...

A young playboy, a vegetarian, a cute boy, a lively classmate and a president of a IT-company. Both their ages and personalities are completely different, just for you.

Who is your favorite "Daisuke"?
