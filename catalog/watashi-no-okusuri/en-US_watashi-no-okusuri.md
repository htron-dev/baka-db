## Sinopse

Inori is an honor student in a witches' school. In order to pass her final exam to graduate, she has to make a "love potion." In order to make that "love potion," Inori lives in the same house with Aoi, in hopes to get him to fall in love with her (required for the "love potion.") The only problem is they don't get along at all! So how will Inori get Aoi to love her when he's always picking on her?!
