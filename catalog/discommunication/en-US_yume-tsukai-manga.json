There are no solutions in the real world: Only \"Dream Messengers\" can find the answers. Dream messengers connect the fabulous with the real and control the power of dreams. Their leader, Mishima Touko, works with 8 other messengers using the powers given by an old spell and a toy made by Touko's father. Touko, her younger sister Rinko, Tachibana Hajime, who loves young girls, and the six other Dream Messengers are given the names of days or stars - Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Raff and Keito.\n\n(Source: KodanClub)",
