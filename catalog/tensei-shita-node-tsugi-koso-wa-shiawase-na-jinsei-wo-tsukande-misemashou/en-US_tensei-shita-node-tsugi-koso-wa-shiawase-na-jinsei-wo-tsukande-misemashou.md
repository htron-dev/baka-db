## Sinopse

After being hit by a car, she suddenly found herself in the afterlife... or so she thought, but for some reason she reincarnated as a baby in another world?! Lizbeth was raised by incredibly doting and beautiful parents, and using the knowledge from her former life she makes a goal to "have a moderately successful life" in this world. However, her talent for magic is abnormal, and a prince, along with many other noble young men have either become infatuated with her, aim to kill her, or almost die... that isn't "moderate" at all! But even so, she swears to obtain the happy life she envisioned, somehow!
