## Sinopse

An incomplete storyboard rests on a desk. Within it, are a boy and girl who suddenly jump to life and escape the confines of the sheet of paper in order to kickstart their story—one defined by their own actions. As they journey across the desk, the world around them begins to transform and signals the start of their vivid new adventure.
