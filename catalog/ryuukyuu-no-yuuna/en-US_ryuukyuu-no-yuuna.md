## Sinopse

Ryuukyuu (ancient Okinawa) is in its golden era in 1482. A young girl named Yuuna is shunned by her community because she has the ability to talk to animals. Her only friends are a pair of lions named Shii and Saa. One day the rumor of Yuuna’s god-given gifts reaches the King’s ears. Shou Shin travels to meet Yuuna in disguise, kicking off their strange adventure...
