## Sinopse

Sweet and pretty high school student Keita is aggressively courting his remedial class teacher, Soga. Soga, however, thinks it's just a childish joke, and that there is no real love... From the beginning of courtship between sensei and student to their first time together, and other romantic stories! In another pairing, an ex-student meets his tutor. Adult love relationships are compiled here. Pure love and romantic love stories of innocent teens and adults who are toyed with by them.
(from B-U)
