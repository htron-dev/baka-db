    "sinopse": "Ako and Hiro were always together. Ako was so sure that Hiro reciprocated her feelings, but after he rejected her, it left a deep scar in her heart. Ten years have passed since then. Ako decides she needs to spread her wings and forget all about what happened. Right when she's having trouble convincing her dad to let her move out on her own, someone comes to the door. It turns out to be Hiro, her first love, and they haven't seen each other since the rejection. But, since Ako's parents trust him a lot, they let her move into his apartment building. Ako is thrilled to be on her own, but when she forgets to call the gas company, she's forced to ask Hiro for help and close the distance between them. Ako wants to reset the bittersweet memories of her first love and try her relationship with Hiro again.\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
