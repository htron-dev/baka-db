## Sinopse

Yeuh-Reum and Hyun Moo-Heum are very different from one another. While Moo-Heum is a brilliant, yet stunning son of a CEO of one of the most influential and extensive companies in the world, Yeuh-Reum, on the other hand, is a mediocre-looking girl—a plain Jane, who is just under an inescapable debt of 70 million! And to whom? It is none other than Hyun Moo-Heum! In the midst of this dilemma, a mysterious figure enters and intervenes with their lives. Could he be of any help to Yeuh-Reum or is he destined to make her life more complicated than it already is?
