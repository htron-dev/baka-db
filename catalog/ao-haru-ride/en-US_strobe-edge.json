    "sinopse": "Through the eyes of Ninako Kinoshita, it seems as if everyone knows what love is. Even when it comes to her own feelings for her childhood friend Daiki Korenaga, it is her friends who attest she is in love. However, a drop of doubt forms in her heart when Ren Ichinose, an attractive idol of the school, accidentally breaks Ninako's phone charm on the train. His earnest promise to compensate for it touches Ninako and she wonders if this is what real love feels like.\n\nLove is like an apple: its outer appearance may look sweet, but its taste can be deceiving. For Ninako, she meets the bitterness of unrequited love as her very first. But as her knowing friends go through different experiences with love, Ninako struggles to understand its complex flavor and fails to notice the way a certain someone looks at only her.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 6: Colorless Dreamer",
