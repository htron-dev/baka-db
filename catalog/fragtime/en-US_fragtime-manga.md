## Sinopse

What would you do if you could stop time? Moritani for one is using her unusual ability to stop time for three minutes a day to observe the people around her. One day, she chooses to "observe" class idol Murakami's panties—only to find herself in a very compromising situation when her classmate turns out to be immune to her power.
