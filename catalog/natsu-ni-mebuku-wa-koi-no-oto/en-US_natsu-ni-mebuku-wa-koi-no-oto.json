    "sinopse": "During my second year of high-school, a transfer student, Yamauchi, arrived in my class. Although he appeared to be an ordinary guy, he was unexpectedly anti-social! I wanted him to quickly get along with the rest of class, so I called out to him, but things didnt go as I wanted no matter how I tried. \"That’s how it is...\" I thought. But out of the blue, Yamauchi smiled at me and since then I couldn’t get it out of my mind. Hey, Yamauchi... can you smile for me once more?\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)",
