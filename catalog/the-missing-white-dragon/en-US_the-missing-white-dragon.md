## Sinopse

What would you say if I told you a history lesson can actually be fun? Does that sound ridiculous? Well, if you think so, then you obviously haven’t read ‘The Missing White Dragon!’ This book is a wonderful compilation of the most popular Asian folk tales and select portions of history, retold with an exotic touch of romance to each. Reading this book will not only introduce fans to the culture of Asia, but it will also give readers an insight to the bedtime stories Asian parents would often tell their children at night. In essence, this beautifully written anthology will show fans the influential stories that Asian children heard just as Americans children would be told fairy tales such as Goldilocks, Little Red Riding Hood, and Hansel & Gretel.
