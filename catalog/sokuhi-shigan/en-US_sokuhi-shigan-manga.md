## Sinopse

While Aida Kiyoka is working at her part-time cleaning job, she suddenly trips to a parallel universe. A kind lady takes her in and she begins her new life there. However she faces one big problem, normal households in this world do not have bathtubs! As a person who has an unusual love for cleanliness and loves taking baths, for Kiyoka this is an utterly unbearable situation. However, one day, she hears that the King is recruiting a side consort. She thinks, 'If I become a consort, won't I be able to have baths every day?' and immediately applies.

A unique trip fantasy, about a girl who loves to clean (clean-freak in denial) and her road to her dreamed bath.
