## Sinopse

Suzuta's a nurse living in hospital housing designated for singles only. He has to hide the younger half-brother he's been caring for. That is, until Dr. Tomioka discovers his secret. He pleads with his colleague to keep it between them. Dr. Tomioka agrees, but on one condition... that he and Suzuta become an official couple! Aggressive love between a mean-spirited doctor and soft-hearted nurse!
