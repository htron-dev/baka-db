## Sinopse

Because of his father's job transfer, Rei had to stay at Ninako's, his cousin who's currently a college student, house. He is thrilled at her welcome, but, much to his surprise, was offered a strange proposal in return for her hospitality—he has to be a transvestite when they're alone. Despite his shyness and indecisiveness, Rei doesn't seem to hate the proposal.
