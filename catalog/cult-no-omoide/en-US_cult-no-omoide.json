    "sinopse": "Nozomitarou reads about Dougen Majima's Sekai Kakumei Kyoudan X cult in a magazine and is attracted by its sense of purpose and the glamorous lifestyle its members lead in the big city of Tokyo. He ends up moving to Tokyo and joining the cult, becoming a salesman for supposed miracle cures, and helping Majima publicise his predictions of a massive earthquake and ensuing political collapse. The story is narrated by an older Nozomitarou looking back after leaving the cult, and is inspired by the author's experience as a former cult member.",
