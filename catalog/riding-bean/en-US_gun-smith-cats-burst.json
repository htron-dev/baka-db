    "sinopse": "Rally Vincent and Minnie-May Hopkins are two regular American girls. Regular American girls who own a gun shop, and might have dabbled in prostitution, respectively. And who happen to be a crack shot and an explosives expert, respectively.\n\nThese might be odd skills for American girls, but these two happen to be Chicago's top bounty hunters. Rally can shoot the trigger off a gun from a good distance, and May generally wreaks havoc with explosions and cuteness. And together, with some very useful friends and associates, they make up the Gunsmith Cats.\n\nBurst finds our ladies back at work, back in action, and...back in trouble.\n\n(Source: Dark Horse)",
