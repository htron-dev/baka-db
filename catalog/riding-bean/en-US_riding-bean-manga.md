## Sinopse

In Chicago, ace courier Bean Bandit rules the road, and operates on both sides of the Law. It doesn't matter if it's legal or not. For the right price, he'll get you or your cargo where it needs to go. When it absolutely, positively, has to be there NOW, Bean Bandit is your man—if you can afford his rates.
