    "sinopse": "The official YouTube channel of the Animelo Summer Live concerts began streaming a Kemono Friends anime short video on Wednesday. The video features Northern White-faced Owl and Eurasian Eagle-Owl gathering a team of friends together to clean up the dilapidated Saitama Super Arena, the real-life venue of the Animelo Summer Live event.\n\nWhile there, the friends find cards that teach proper behavior while enjoying the concert, such as not using electronic devices. (\"What's a 'mobile'?\" \"Doesn't look very tasty.\") Later, the friends see how many people are entering the venue (far above their estimate of 100), and beat a hasty retreat.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
