## Sinopse

A childhood friend, Akira Sajima, who suddenly disappeared more than 20 years ago, appeared in front of Makoto Ooe, who runs a local bakery. Akira, who has nowhere to go, decides to live together with Makoto while helping out. Makoto slept with Akira every night while whispering sweet words "Become my family," but when he asked what he was doing after he went missing, he didn't answer for some reason...?
