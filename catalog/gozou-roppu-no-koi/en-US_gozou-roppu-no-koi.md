## Sinopse

Yomogi's Diner quietly operates at night. Male hosts who work in a nearby club go there after work. The diner is managed by Ichiro, a serious young man who can't be said to have good customer service. Ichiro finds the most popular host from the club, Seiichi, the hardest to deal with. He can't read the emotions on Seiichi's foolishly smiling face. Seiichi is someone who is strangely sharp, overly friendly, and yet offends him one way or another. But, when Seiichi compliments Ichiro's food, his image of the host changes completely...
