## Sinopse

Hajime and Eiji, who were childhood friends, have been reunited at an all-boy's high school (oh, the possibilities). Their friendship is still as strong, but it seems as Eiji is ready to confess. Will Hajime accept the confession? How many other boys in this school will be joining the boi love craze? And will anyone ever call Uncle Kai-Sensei?
(from B-U)
