## Sinopse

Ashley is a vampire who's been living an eternal life. In order to ease his loneliness, he starts traveling around the world to find a lover with his attendant doll, Noelâ€¦ Its beautiful, delicate art adds charm to this sorrowful and serious story. Nevertheless, it somehow brings cynical laughter as well. Enjoy this dark (joke) fantasy!
