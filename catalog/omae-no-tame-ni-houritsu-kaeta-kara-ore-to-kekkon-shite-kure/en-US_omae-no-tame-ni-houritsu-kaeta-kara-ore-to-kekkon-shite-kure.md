## Sinopse

Shiro and Sougo have been friends since childhood. One day, Shiro confessed his feelings and asked Sougo to marry him, "I like you, please marry me when we're adults!"

"Don't you know the law says two men can't get married?"

Many years later...

"For you, I changed the law, so, please, marry me!"
