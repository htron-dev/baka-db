    "sinopse": "The 28-year-old ballet dancer Kiwako is not longer satisfied with her live and is thinking about ending her carrier as a professional, from which she even can't make a living and has to work in a bar to make ends meet. Then she would be able to do all the thing she couldn't until now, like smoking cigarettes, eating sweets and falling in love.\n\nShe meets her neighbour, a 52-year-old college professor for German Language. Much to her surprise she falls in love with him and after her spontaneous confession a complicated love story unfolds, where Kiwako learns that in times you hate the person you love.\n\n(Source: Tsukikagescans)",
