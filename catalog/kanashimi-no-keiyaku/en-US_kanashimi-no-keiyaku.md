## Sinopse

Nadine didn't know what to do. She was asked to be a surrogate mother by her friend Lisa, and how could she refuse? But the agreement requires her to spend the night with Lisa's husband, Cameron, and Nadine is worried that the feelings she's long suppressed might resurface. She has been secretly in love with Cameron for six years, and the morning after sleeping with Cameron, her heart is filled with regret. But then Nadine catches Lisa cheating on Cameron, and she must decide what that will mean for her and Cameron.
