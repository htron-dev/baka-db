    "sinopse": "In an experimental school in Japan students are instructed to download a mobile app named \"TROIA\" designed to improve their education, enhance their interpersonal skills and encourage social activities by completing \"Quests\" that are randomly sent to each student.\n\nSounds like a bit of fun but there is a catch, the bottom ranking student each week gets expelled and soon students find out that the \"Quests\" are not as innocent as they appear nor strictly bound by rules.\n\nFriendship, trust, respect, knowledge, skills, every student will be tested to their limit as failure is not an option!\n\n(Source: MU)",
