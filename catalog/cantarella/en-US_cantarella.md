## Sinopse

From birth, Cesare Borgia is surrounded by hellish shadows that threaten to consume him. Damned by his own father, hated by his closest brother, separated from the sister who loves him, and driven by the demons of Hell itself, he sets out on a quest for power that threatens to set the world of Renaissance Italy ablaze. Will he find salvation in Michelotto, a mysterious assassin bent on saving Cesare's soul... even if it means slaying his demon-possessed body? Or will all Italy be seduced by the tragic eyes of the infamous murderer known as Cesare Borgia?
