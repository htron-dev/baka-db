    "sinopse": "Although an attractive girl, Toroko is a terrible actress. Despite the fact that she messes up her lines, ignores her superiors, and generally causes mayhem, Touzai Television continues to use her in many of their shows. People begin to notice, and the tabloid reporter, Rokurou, intends to get to the bottom of this mystery. Little does he know that his investigation will turn up a strange relationship between the actress and a demon... or that he will soon be a part of that uneasy relationship himself.\n\n(Source: Digital Manga Publishing)",
