    "sinopse": "Explore the world of Tokyo Ghoul with these pros\n\nGhouls live among us, the same as normal people in every way—except their craving for human flesh.\n\nKen Kaneki is an ordinary college student until a violent encounter turns him into the first half-human half-ghoul hybrid. Trapped between two worlds, he must survive Ghoul turf wars, learn more about Ghoul society and master his new powers.\n\nMany conflicts and incidents arise involving the clientele of the café Anteiku, where Ghouls gather. Yoshimura, the café's owner, is harboring suspicions about a certain someone. What sort of darkness will that person bring between those who hunt and those who are hunted? This book chronicles six all-new stories from the Tokyo Ghoul universe.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
