## Sinopse

"If there are men who can get pregnant, what will happen to Love?"

This is a near-future, marriage-hunting SF comedy. In the year 2063, it's not rare to alter human's gene. The main protagonist, Kiyotaka Ujiie, when entering high school moved to Kanto from Hokkaido. He there meets 4 men who could get pregnant. Such men's hope is, surprisingly, a bride hunting!
