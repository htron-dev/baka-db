His encounter with Soy completely changes his life around, as the hidden powers within him awakens, causing Soy and her Shade to lose their lives. Unaware of the mystery behind “Shade” and the role of a “Shade Magician”, Hyung Gee decides to join ‘School’, which is an organization that does research on “Shade Magicians”. Although Hyung Gee joined to find out more about his powers and his parents (who are currently missing), little does he know that this was all a plot from the School to get him to join.\n\n(Soure: Manga Updates)",
