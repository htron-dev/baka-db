## Sinopse

The sword-slashing sequel to Peace Maker is here! Three months have passed since the Ikedaya Incident that crushed the anti-shogunate rebellion—and propelled the Shinsengumi, Kyoto's now-official police, into history as Kyoto's premium peacekeeping force. But there is no rest for the peaceful: An unexpected threat to the Shinsengumi arises, and it's going to take more than mere swords to defeat this new terror on the horizon.
