## Sinopse

Based off the popular N64 game. Looking for a old friend in the lost woods, Link soon finds himself thrown into a parallel world by the mischievous actions of a possessed Skull Kid. Link finds a land in grave danger. The dark power of a relic called Majora's Mask has wreaked havoc on the citizens of Termina, but their most urgent problem is a suicidal moon crashing toward the world. Link has only 72 hours to find a way to stop its descent.
