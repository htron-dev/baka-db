    "sinopse": "This comic was written and illustrated by Shotaro Isinomori, one of Japan's most famous comic book creators. It was originally serialized in Nintendo Power Magazine. The first of 12 parts appeared in January 1992 (Volume 32) and the series ran through December 1992. It was published in book form in 1993. The plot loosely follows ALttP, but some elements were added to \"preserve the elements of surprise and add to the dramatic flow.\"\n\n(Source: Zelda Legends)",
