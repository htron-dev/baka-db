## Sinopse

The young lady Lina originally comes from the wealthy count Randall's family line. However, because of the bad weather that resulted in bad crops and because of her good-natured father, the family ended up being severely swindled. She quickly fell and became a poverty-stricken young lady. But then one day, Lina is forced to participate in the evening party to decide the fiancée of the third prince Gilberto... Since she stuck out like a sore thumb she decided to leave after she got a glance of the prince, but... What is that dazzling light behind the cheers of joy the young ladies are making...?!
