Kitty has an ulterior motive for applying to work as a live-in chef for Darius Speed, a world-famous movie director. Darius is a thief! He is planning to make a film based on a script he stole from Caro, an elderly woman who helped Kitty in her time of need. But Caro has no evidence, which is why Kitty decides to infiltrate Darius's home to get the script back. But looking into Darius's beautiful eyes, Kitty finds it hard to believe this man is capable of such a thing....
