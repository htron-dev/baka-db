## Sinopse

Yuugo went to the RPG world to play until he realized he was on the highest level. Thus, this attracted a lot of players especially cute girls there.

"I felt like I don't want to return to reality!"

With his perverted mind, Yuugo took a dungeon quest and realized there's no reset button or even resurrection spells.
