    "sinopse": "Serika is your typical high school girl. She loves reading books, likes romance, and has the ability to knock a guy flat out with her fist. She imagines herself as one of those heroines she reads in books, a shining maiden waiting for her prince. But what happens to her dream when the prince she has been waiting for is not only younger than her, but also smaller? Will the princess accept the chibi prince?\n\n(Source: Aerandria)",
