## Sinopse

Dabin Choi is the daughter of Seoul's most powerful crime boss, and daddy's little girl has the hots for Eugene, the son of one of her father's "friends."

There's just one problem: Eugene isn't into Dabin. In fact, he thinks of her more like a little sister. (The kiss of death!) To make matters worse, Dabin's new classmate is none other than the son of her father's long-time rival. Soon, everyone at school begins playing power games that would make their fathers proud!
