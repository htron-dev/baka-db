## Sinopse

Trying to avoid being so popular with women, the legendary girl-magnet Takeuchi transfers to an all-boys school. Once there, he can’t help but wonder why Iida, who he’s known for a while, always eats his lunch early. At first he only thought him a little strange, but before he realized it, he found himself following him with his eyes all the time. The two become close by Iida sharing his bento. Being with the fun-loving Iida every day turns Takeuchi’s dull days into fun ones?!
