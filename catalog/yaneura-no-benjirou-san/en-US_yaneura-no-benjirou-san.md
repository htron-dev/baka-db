## Sinopse

After his mother's death, Kanji goes to live with her side of the family in the countryside. It's hard enough having to adjust to a new environment, but Kanji can also see monsters and spirits, who are everywhere. To top it off, his eccentric uncle Benjirou—though prone to bouts of sickness—is always up to some shenanigans!
