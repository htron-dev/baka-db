## Sinopse

Young girls living in a school dormitory. Yui, who lives in a remote island, had to move to Bellwood House, a dormitory for girls, because the school on her island is closed and the new school would be too far to commute. Hilarity ensues as she comes across fellow dorm mates with peculiarities.
