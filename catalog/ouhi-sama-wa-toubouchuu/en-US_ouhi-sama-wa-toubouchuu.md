## Sinopse

Shize, who has been living a fugitive life in Japan, was summoned to another world. There, she got married to the king and gave birth to an adorable baby girl. She had finally found a place where she belonged, and couldn't be happier. But suddenly the head priest of the palace forced her to return to the earth?!

While running from the hands of evil, Shize escaped from the palace, but...?
