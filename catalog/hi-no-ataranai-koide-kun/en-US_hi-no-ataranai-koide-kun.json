    "sinopse": "Koide was turned into a vampire at the age of sixteen one hundred and thirty-three years ago. Now, poor Koide is trapped in an eternal loop of the same old homework, the same boring lectures and meaningless tests, and an ever-unquenchable thirst for blood. Koide has repeated his uneventful sophomore year of high school one hundred and thirty-three times, and now, in his one hundred and thirty fourth year, he doesn't expect things to change—and is frankly too bored to care.\n\nBut his classmates this year seem a little different than before. They're thrilled to have a vampire in their midst, and are eager to do whatever they can to help. Will \"134\" be Koide's lucky number or is that just wishful thinking?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
