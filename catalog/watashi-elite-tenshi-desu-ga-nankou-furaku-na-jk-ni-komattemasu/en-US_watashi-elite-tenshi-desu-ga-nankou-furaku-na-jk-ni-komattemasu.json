    "sinopse": "Ariel is an angel, a being that exists to reward good deeds by granting small wishes that appear over people's heads. But one day, she encounters a girl whose wish neither she, nor any previous angel, could read. Aiming to grant Kirara's unknown wish, she descends upon the human world to meet her personally, but Kirara's mind isn't as innocent as her mountain of good deeds may suggest.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
