## Sinopse

This is the story of the workers in the Maid Cafe Curio, based on the video game. The current shop manager, Daisuke, is a young man standing in for his newly remarried and traveling father. He must deal with all the quirky young ladies who work at the maid cafe, including his newest hire, the runaway rich girl Misato, who doesn't know the first thing about working at a maid cafe. Other workers include Daisuke's new stepsister Suzu, the aggressive floor chief Midori, the clumsy chef Sayaka, the absent-minded waitress Imako, and the academic-minded Kanako.
