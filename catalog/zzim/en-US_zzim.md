## Sinopse

What happens when you want to kiss your girlfriend, but you have rotten teeth? And if you wanted to get more attention from your loved one, would you play "hard-to-get"? How much courage does it take to go after what you desire? These questions and more will be answered in 5 hilarious short stories about high school crushes, first kisses, summer jobs and best friends!
