Hailing from a small powerless nation, she is far from a desirable bride, and yet her hand in marriage is pursued by the most powerful man of the empire, Emperor Leandroth Levante Barenshiaga. Despite the initial shock, she resolves to be the picture of a perfect wife and to maintain a cold distance, but on the very night she arrives, she has a vivid dream of an extremely intimate encounter between her and the emperor.\n\nThis dream and the emperor's kind consideration toward her weakens her resolve. Matilda now wonders why the emperor is interested in her, and whether her \"dream\" was truly all in her head.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
