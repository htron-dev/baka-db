## Sinopse

Shirakaba Yuki is a girl with the Catulus syndrome, which afflicts her with cat ears and a tail, plus some cat-like behavior. In the middle of her high school entrance ceremony, Ayano Riko—who is also a first year—comes in with a mountain of cats on her back. Apparently she's a cat magnet...

Unexpectedly they become friends?
