## Sinopse

Jun Ichijou is a high school student. However, he is a loner and even on lunch break the only thing he does is studying. As a result of great effort, his test ranking rose and while he was satisfied with his loner life,

"Hi-hi-hi... Virgin, teach me again♪"

"Shut up, b\*tch. Let's finish it quick today, okay?"

"Yay!"

One day, it was decided that he will help blonde gal Karen Tachibana, central figure of the class, with her studies. Loner during lunch break, tête-à-tête studying after school... So continues the double life. Tsundere-like, but good at taking care of people Ichijou-kun. A bit mischievous Tachibana-san with an innocent smile. With this and that happening, the two get along so well that others cringe.
