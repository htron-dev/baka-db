    "sinopse": "Jun Ichijou is a high school student. However, he is a loner and even on lunch break the only thing he does is studying. As a result of great effort, his test ranking rose and while he was satisfied with his loner life,\n\n\"Hi-hi-hi... Virgin, teach me again♪\"\n\n\"Shut up, b\\*tch. Let's finish it quick today, okay?\"\n\n\"Yay!\"\n\nOne day, it was decided that he will help blonde gal Karen Tachibana, central figure of the class, with her studies. Loner during lunch break, tête-à-tête studying after school... So continues the double life. Tsundere-like, but good at taking care of people Ichijou-kun. A bit mischievous Tachibana-san with an innocent smile. With this and that happening, the two get along so well that others cringe.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
