He gets called to fill in a free reservation spot where he meets the handsome, air-headed Masaki Mimori... Akira thought he was just a regular client and immediately jumped the gun, but soon realized his mistake... Things take a different turn, and he ends up not only being a babysitter of the cute Towa... but a papa sitter, too...?\n\n(Source: MU)",
