In this compilation based on the best-selling manga series, artists ranging from the famed Takagi Nobuyuki (Kokoro Toshokan and Pure Marionation) to Peach-Pit (creator of DearS) themselves have created hilarious stories featuring the hottest characters from DearS. Sometimes sweet and innocent, sometimes a little bit erotic, this is a must-have for fans of the popular manga. (Source: Tokyopop)
