## Sinopse

Because of a painful past memory, Kanan can't believe in love again. Yet after meeting with the priest, Jake, he begins to experience the joy he longs for. Even the strong possessiveness of Jake's, that is beyond normal, to Kanan is also a wonderful feeling... could this be the love he refuses to believe in?!
