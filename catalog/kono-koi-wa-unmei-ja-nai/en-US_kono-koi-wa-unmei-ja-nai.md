## Sinopse

Tsukamoto is newly independent designer who wants his work to be printed with traditional movable printing at the Nakajima printing house. There, he meets the delinquent turned printing master, Seto. Seto's skills and knowledge are undeniable, but his insensitivity and firm opinions cause him to butt heads with Tsukamoto. As they continue to work together, Seto's passion for printing shines through, and Tsukamoto's feelings begin to change. Then one day, they receive a huge job, and the client is none other than...Tsukamoto's ex-lover, Soejima?!
