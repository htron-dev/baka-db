## Sinopse

A long time ago...

There was a disease that would cause nightmares and kill people. Doctors and wizards threw in the towel, unable to find a cure. All of a sudden, mysterious magicians appeared. These magicians ate the nightmares of those who suffered from them. It was said that those who had their dreams eaten were able to sleep peacefully.

This is the story of "Baku."
