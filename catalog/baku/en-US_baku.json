    "sinopse": "A long time ago...\n\nThere was a disease that would cause nightmares and kill people. Doctors and wizards threw in the towel, unable to find a cure. All of a sudden, mysterious magicians appeared. These magicians ate the nightmares of those who suffered from them. It was said that those who had their dreams eaten were able to sleep peacefully.\n\nThis is the story of \"Baku.\"\n\n(Source: Iskultrip Scans)",
