## Sinopse

Maybe if someone had told Koi, Ai and Ren, they could stay out of trouble. The girls try to finish their missions by the book, but something always gets in the way. Sometimes it's a super-shy girl, sometimes it's a hyperactive devil, but it's always trouble. If these girls want to get their stamps and become full-fledged cupids, they'll have to play to win!
