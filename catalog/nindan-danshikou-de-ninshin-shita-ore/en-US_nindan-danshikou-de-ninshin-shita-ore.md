## Sinopse

In a somewhat omegaverse Japan where some men are capable of becoming pregnant, Kazuki Ikumi is in a pickle when he finds out that he is one of those "men." He tries to keep it under wraps but his childhood friend, Chiharu Kurobane, the last person he would ever want it to be known to, finds out! Chiharu can't help but lay his hands on his childhood friend and despite his resistance, Kazuki's body won't listen!
