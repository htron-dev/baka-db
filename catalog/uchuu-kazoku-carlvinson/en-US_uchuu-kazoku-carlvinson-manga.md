## Sinopse

When a motley band of traveling performers have a deep-space collision with another spacecraft, they find that the sole survivor of the other craft is a humanoid infant. They decide to raise the child as their own on the nearest planet as they wait for other members of the girl's race to come and find her. Corona-chan grows up as their daughter, and the manga details her five-year-old adventures with her fuzzball mother, her robot-soldier father, her living-central-nervous-system pet, and the other bizarre members of the local village.
