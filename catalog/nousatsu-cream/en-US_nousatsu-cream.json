    "sinopse": "The title story is about Koyama Rei, a part-time worker at an ad agency who loves sweets so much that she has whipped cream for lunch! Conversely her coworker Kuze is grumpy, temperamental and basically not the sweets kind of guy. That is, until one night a kiss mixed with cream forces them both to reconsider their preferences of tastes! Perhaps some sort of compromise can be reached that satisfies both Rei’s excessive sweet tooth and Kuze’s dislike for sweet things (food wise), but not necessarily other types of “desserts.”\n\n(Source: Aurora Publishing)",
