    "sinopse": "In the Momoiro Danshi series:\n\nVol.1 - Ringo-hen\n\nVol.2 - Momo & Mikan Papa Hen (MOMO & MIKAN version)\nMomo's story is sweet and fresh. It's a romantic comedy.\nMake \"love\" as enriching as possible? Must have elements of \"Di*k, Play, Position!!\" (di*k, foreplay, sexual position.)\nLovely Tsumori speaks a word, and it makes Momo think of an art of pleasure!\nYes, Momo! You can be a good shag!! Just go for it!\n\nMomo's father, Mikan, his story is a bit serious.\nHe is idiosyncratic, and his nature makes his match lose his sprit of rivalry.\nKnowing that he's been doing mean things, he has been doing Judo* (* Japanese art of self-defense) in his ardent desire to fulfill a promise with Kawashima.\nBut, unluckily, Kawashima becomes icy against him. Mikan can't stand it... what he's gonna do...?\n\n(Source: MU)",
