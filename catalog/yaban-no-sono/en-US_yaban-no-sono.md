## Sinopse

High-class Robotics School a.k.a. Kousen is a high school that professionalizes in robotics. Although they have won many robotic competitions, they are not very well known for anything. The story doesn't focus on the school itself, but revolves more around a boy named Kaneko (which is actually a girl's name) and his misfortune in the school. He is forced to cross-dress and do various "things" throughout the school year. No one knows what will happen in this school, especially when the senpai (upperclassmen) are a bunch of perverts!
