## Sinopse

I live in company housing for singles. After I was just called "boring" and dumped, my super-perfect subordinate and neighbor, Karanuma, confesses his love for me! Why me...?! A guy who drowns his sorrows in alcohol, then nearly drowns in the bathroom?! This time, I refuse to be called "boring!" So, I've made a decision, but...

Also contains the GUSH favorite, "Let's Tie Hands Firmly," a sentimental story about childhood friends in love! When Atsushi quits his job in the city and returns to his hometown, he finds his childhood friend, Satoru, all grown up and a little distant.
