## Sinopse

The moment she set eyes on "The Hero of the East," Chris Ray Gracias, the reincarnator Berlina Lacotte knew that he was her fated one. So she begins—not so inconspicuously—trailing the hero's party, hoping to one day worm her way into his stalwart heart. Her usual routine involves following him into dangerous dungeons, always peeking from behind a conveniently positioned tree or wall and fawning over the dashing combatant. No matter how long it takes, Berlina will achieve her dream of becoming the hero's bride!
