## Sinopse

Kenji is a high school student who just can't seem to stop fighting the other boys in his school, but an encounter with his estranged childhood friend Yuu threatens to turn his world upside down! The Yuu he remembers was a short little guy who reminded Kenji of his dog. He even nicknamed Yuu with a typical dog name! But now, Yuu couldn't be any more different. He's tall, handsome, and unbeatable! As Kenji's mind fills with questions and doubts, his hormones go wild. Something new awakens inside him, and suddenly... Every guy in town wants him!? Can Kenji get used to this condition and work out what is happening to him? And what about Yuu?
