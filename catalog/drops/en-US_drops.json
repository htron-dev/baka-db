Behold the unfolding story of the unavoidable family circumstances and romantic entanglements of the five Matsuno siblings in this erotic and cute omnibus by the new star Yuiji Aniya's! The honors student eldest sister is currently head over heels for \"Daddy\". The rock-and-roll second sister is living the life of peace and love with her new baby in tow. The twin sisters who live in their own world are puzzling over what to do now that they've fallen for the same man. And the youngest child, and only brother, after having to put up with all his sisters, is taking a trip down the rebellious path. But we all still get along fine. We're all pretty happy in our own way.\n\n(Source: JManga)",
