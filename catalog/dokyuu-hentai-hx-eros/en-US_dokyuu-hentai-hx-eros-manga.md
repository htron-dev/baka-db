When the alien Kiseichuu descend on Earth, they have one goal: eradicate the human race. They do so by feeding off the very passion that drives humans to reproduce, their H-Energy!

Living in a dorm with the four beautiful women of the HXEROS team, Retto finds himself caught up in a web of erotic intrigue where the whole world is at stake!
