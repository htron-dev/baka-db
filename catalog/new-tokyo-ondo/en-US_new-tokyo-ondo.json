He and female companion rush down the length of his arm toward the city lights.The work is defined by a speedy style and comical pictures that express the sense of omnipotence derived from coming into a large sum of money and folly of letting happiness slip through your hands.\n\nShort film by nuQ (Misaki Uwabo).\n\n(Source: Official Page)",
