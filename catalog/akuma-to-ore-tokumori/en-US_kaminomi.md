## Sinopse

In the war of heaven and hell, the angels have been defeated, heaven has been taken over by demons and the angels’ king, God, has been captured. He is sentenced to death and is awaiting execution. All seems to be lost, but the angels have one last hope and that is the Fruit of God. There are only 12 of these rare artifacts left and it gives any mortal who eats one the power equivalent to God himself.

Chris, an angel, has been given the task of finding 12 individuals worthy of this power, giving the fruit to them, and using them as the weapon they need to fight against the demons. But things go terribly wrong and Kamishirosawa Kaya, a regular teenage girl, ends up consuming all 12 of them, giving her 12 times the power of God and, at the same time, making her the one and only hope for the heavens.
