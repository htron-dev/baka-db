## Sinopse

Something evil lurks within the house. It is in the rooms that nobody enters, it is in the dark forest all around, and it is in the minds of the people that live there. Only when a red snake appears does the evil manifest itself, unleashing horrific events that end in a bloody orgy of murder and mayhem!
