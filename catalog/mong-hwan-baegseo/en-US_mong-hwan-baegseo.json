    "sinopse": "An ordinary high school girl, Lin Seonu, unknown even to herself is actually a woman saint holding ancient power called the \"Jade of Bango.\" On her seventeenth birthday, she obtained the power to see ghosts, and every morning after that she goes to school accompanied by the harmless and lovely ghosts.\n\nOne day, however, Lin has an abnormal dream, and that evening, she encounters a terrible evil spirit. Shivering in horror, she is rescued in the nick of time by a handsome man she had seen in a dream. He frees the ridiculous power that had been concealed in her. He says that his name is In Mu, and that he is her fiance.\n\n(Source: MU)",
