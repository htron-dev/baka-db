## Sinopse

Spring, the fox is in the middle of a party. Workers' family of raccoon dogs reveal their field work during the hot summer and harvest autumn. A fox who stupidly hunts the Raccoon dumplings carrying the harvest with perspiration, before the raccoon dog wears it, takes away the food of the rabbit. A cold winter comes. The Raccoon family is having a good time around the hearth, but the fox is troubled with food and wandering in the snow. The fox intends a collective battle, raises a fire from the fire, causes a fire, and tries to rob the storage of the raccoon warehouse. A raccoon dog that turns into a truck and turns a fox that escaped a storage, turns it into a rainbow and chases it. The fight between the fox and the raccoon dog begins with a transformation. The family supports the raccoon guns that are struggling as one wing, and finally fights the fox.
