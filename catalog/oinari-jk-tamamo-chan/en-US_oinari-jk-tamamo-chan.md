## Sinopse

Tamamo says she's a transfer student from Kyoto, but her true identity is an Inari from the Fushimi's Inari Shrine! Most adults see her as a beautiful young girl, but her classmates see her for what she really is, which they keep underwraps as they interact with her in this heartfelt comedy manga!
