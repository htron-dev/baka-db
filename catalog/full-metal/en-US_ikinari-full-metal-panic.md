## Sinopse

Sousuke has finally lost his mind—and his memory! Rehashing his previous exploits will keep Kaname busy, but it doesn't take long for the military mind of this soldier to bounce back with a bang—literally! He's locked, loaded, and back to his old self by first period, as bombs and bullets grace the halls of high school!
