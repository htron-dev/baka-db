## Sinopse

Handyman Maki has taken in a guy called Naru who helps with work in return for a roof over his head. The pair are roommates, work partners, and friends with benefits! Naru may complain a lot, but he'll do whatever Maki says because he's deeply in love with him. He can't seem to accept that they only have a physical relationship, and finds his heart racing whenever Maki touches him. One day, Naru meets a client who happens to be someone from Maki's past... Can these two really stay purely physical considering how they feel about each other? This is a chaotic comedy involving work and romance between a stoic, fearless dom and his devoted but volatile pet!!
