## Sinopse

"I've always felt this discomfort with my own body. I wondered why my penis never grew on my body even though I always hanged out with the boys in the class. I was scolded for asking Santa for a penis. In elementary school, boys teased my by undressing me. I never wore the uniform, but only the school jersey. I never made a friend. When I had my first period, the shock was excruciating. My mind lied to my own body, and I just wanted to die. I began to worry if I was a freak...

But when I found out that I was not the only one through the internet, my world opened up. Even so, my own freedom was nowhere to be found at home."
