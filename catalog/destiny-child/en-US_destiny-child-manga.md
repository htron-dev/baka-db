## Sinopse

The sudden retirement of Lucifario, who had ruled as Archfiend for untold eons, incited a war for succession known as the Archfiend Contest. Thus did numerous Archfiend candidates, each dreaming of being the next to take the throne, descend upon the Moral Realm.

Now, the story of one such Archfiend candidate and his army of Childs is about to begin!
