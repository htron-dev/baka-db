## Sinopse

High school student Yuuto Sakuraba does not conceal his hardcore otaku nature or the fact that he is heavily into moe drawings from an artist named Sayane. At school, he is seated next to Kotone Kashiwagi, the school idol who shows distaste toward otaku culture. One day, however, Yuuto stumbles upon Kotone in the otaku store he works at, discovering that Kotone is also an otaku!

This chance encounter brings the two unlikely friends closer, Yuuto promising that he will keep her passion a secret. They soon have secret meetings to discuss their common interests. But what Yuuto doesn't know is that Kotone Kashiwagi is, in fact, the moe artist Sayane!
