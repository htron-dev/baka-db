    "sinopse": "The year is 2019, and the Japanese government has recently increased their involvement in censorship of the mass media. The upcoming Tokyo Olympics accelerates their efforts. Depictions deemed obscene by the Japanese government become increasingly difficult to publish, even in manga.\n\nUnder these circumstances, manga author Hibino Mikio just got an opportunity to publish his horror manga: \"Dark Walker.\" His manga centers around a disease that turns normal people into cannibals during the night. Watch as Mikio finds himself in a manga industry shaken by a war on the freedom of expression.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
