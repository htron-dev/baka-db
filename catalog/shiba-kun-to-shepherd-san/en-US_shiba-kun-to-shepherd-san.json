    "sinopse": "Yuuto Shibamoto is a college student who loves dogs. His favorite thing to do lately is watching the big German shepherd that comes on its walks to the convenience store where he works. But happenstance sends him hurtling into an intimate relationship with the shepherd's owner, Inukai! Inukai is a gruff character, but when he occasionally reveals a kind and gentle smile, why does his heart skip a beat? And why is he attracted to his big, athletic body...? An upperclassman, handsome shepherd owner, and a cute underclassman shiba inu owner, in a doggie-to-doggie sweet and sexy love affair.\n\n(Source: J Publishing, translated)",
