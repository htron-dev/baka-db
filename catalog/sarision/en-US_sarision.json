Ekwedra.\nThe sword, Ekwedra, is a legendary sword. It is said that the very first creator of the world was using Ekwedra. Ekwedra has its own will and will only be controlled by those who have purest blood of Dragon clan. Even having purest blood of Dragon Clan, all went berserk as they held the Ekwedra. However, few, very few cases, there were persons who could not be overruled by Ekwedra.\nApparently, Sarision is one of those who wouldn't be controlled by Ekwedra and go berserk.\n(Source: JanimeS).",
