From Aerandria:
Who am I? I’m Gi-ryum, a tall, handsome bachelor, and the coolest guy in the country who even makes O△ sama (Reference to “Yon-sama”: Bae, Yon-Jun from Winter Sonata) cry at my beauty. One day, I received classified info of the princess enrolling in a regular high school. Huhuhu. Can I snag the princess with my irresistible beauty?! I will be the king’s new son-in-law!
