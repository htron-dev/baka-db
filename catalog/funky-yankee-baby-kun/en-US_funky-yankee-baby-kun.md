## Sinopse

Kikka, the chief of the bancho, is a charismatic existence who is recognized by the bad guys around him because of his overwhelming fighting strength. One of Kikka's natural enemies is the teacher Kayane. He asks his old friend Chiaki to capture Kikka in order to receive supplementary lessons. However, a battle love between Chiaki, who is proud of his skill as a collector, and Kikka, who never wants to lose, breaks out. The encounter between the two has evolved into a fiercely hot yankee conflict involving everyone from sukeban to the boy!?
