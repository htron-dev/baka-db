    "sinopse": "Rebellious misfit Fujieda Kei hates everything about his life; the elite private school he was forced to attend, his unreliable \"friends,\" and the annoying cellphone which is always buzzing with calls from people who want to ask him for favors as the school's bad-boy. Quiet, studious, and admired by students and teachers alike, Sakuraba Atsushi appears to be his polar opposite in every way.\n\nSince they obviously have nothing in common, they had never even spoken to each other before - despite being classmates. But all of this changes one day when Fujieda's classroom prank goes wrong; Sakuraba lets his unemotional demeanor slip for a moment as he taunts Fujieda and his vagrant lifestyle. Faced with Sakuraba's true personality, Fujieda is gripped by an emotion he had never experienced before...\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nShounen wa Ashita...
