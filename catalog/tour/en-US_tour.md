## Sinopse

Hiiro is a cycling enthusiast and has been riding since he could remember, being heavily influenced by his dad, Katsu who is a professional cyclist. Hiiro and his riding partner and best friend, Kisou, have been cycling fanatics and even watched Zeus Strong win the Tour de France in awe. They learn he is coming to their country to compete in the Japan Cup which Katsu is also racing in and Katsu promises Hiiro a win. However, Zeus Strong dominates Katsu and crushingly defeats him. The heartbroken Katsu promises to Hiiro that he will go train for a year and return to him with a championship. In the meantime, Hiiro practices and learns that he has the ability to see the wind, something only a handful of professionals can do.
