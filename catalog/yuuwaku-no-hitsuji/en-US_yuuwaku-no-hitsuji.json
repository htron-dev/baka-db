Their paths cross when fate throws Nicolae in front of Alvere's carriage, and the nobleman finds himself entranced with Nicolae's beauty and purity. Nicolae believes he can offer Alvere solace in God, but this wolf in sheep's clothing wants nothing to do with God, and everything to do with Nicolae.\n\n(Source: Dramaqueen)",
