## Sinopse

Takaya wokes up and found himself in an opened car trunk, with strangers looking over him. Confused at first, he thought he's still in his room but apparently he is not. To make things worse, this is not his car, he is naked and doesn't bring any things with him and he can't remember anything that happened 1 week ago. How he is ended up in a car is a mystery.
