## Sinopse

The Kingdom of Albein was blessed with the appeareance of the Miracle children, individuals with the greatest talents ever seen. Despite being around ten years old, with abilities many times stronger than the average adventurer, they managed to reach a strength score exceeding 100,000 points, granting them the adventurer grade SSS. With a mere party of five persons, they defeated the Demon Lord regaining the kindgom's peace.

After that journey, Dick Silver, the most balanced between them, racked his brain to not draw public attention. In the end, he decided to become the guild master of a suburban guild as a reward, becoming its twelfth successor. After five years he reached his aim and then became a regular of his own guild's bar. But one day, as he was drinking at the bar as always, the daughter of a certain aristocrat came to pay him a visit.
