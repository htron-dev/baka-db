    "sinopse": "Real Drive is a \"neo-futuristic science-fiction suspense\" story set in A.D. 2061, when a new, more secure information network called the Material Network (or \"Metal\") has taken over human society. However, aberrations begin to crop up as individuals chafe against the rigid system, and so-called \"cyber divers\" are dispatched to investigate these incidents. The main characters are the cyber driver Mari, an \"intuitive girl\" named Minamo, the team's head Eiichirou, the combat expert Souta, and the android Horon.\n\n(Source: MU)",
