## Sinopse

Danzi, 31, has been living alone now for around 10 months when a sudden call from her mother brings back memories of why she moved out in the first place. In her eponymous comic, Danzi uses her personal diaries to recount her experience growing up with two brothers and emotionally abusive parents. An instant hit in South Korea, this comic confronts issues such as sexism and domestic violence in a way that's inviting, albeit heartbreaking.
