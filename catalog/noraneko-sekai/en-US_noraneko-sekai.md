Territorial warfare, street fights, and mafia cats gutter!

At night, when humans fall asleep, cats take possession of the streets and roofs and go into badass mode! Driven by their ancestral instincts, the band chiefs defend or enlarge their territory with claws and fangs to keep aside the trickier cats! Following an unexpected encounter, Hige, a wandering tomcat fell at the bottom of the feline social scale, finds himself drawn into the whirlwind of rivalries between the clans that rule over the different districts.
