Driven by their ancestral instincts, the band chiefs defend or enlarge their territory with claws and fangs to keep aside the trickier cats! Following an unexpected encounter, Hige, a wandering tomcat fell at the bottom of the feline social scale, finds himself drawn into the whirlwind of rivalries between the clans that rule over the different districts.\n\n(Source: Nautiljon, translated)",
