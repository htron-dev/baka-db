## Sinopse

Six members of the occult circle will spend a few days at a ruined love hotel during their summer vacation. Upon arrival, they meet two additional people who join them, but on the morning of the second day, a female member was found tied & naked. In addition, the exit was locked by someone and the building became a completely enclosed cage. Will this be a repeat of the 'kodoku' that happened 3 years ago?
