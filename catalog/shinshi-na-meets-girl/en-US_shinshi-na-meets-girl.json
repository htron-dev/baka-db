    "sinopse": "Maeda Shinshi is a typical 24 year old white collar worker and he receives an anonymous love letter from a girl. He finds out that the girl in love with him is an elementary school girl named Oyamada Nana, a very quiet, shy and a little confused girl. Shinshi has no idea how to interact with Nana and everytime he tries to make her feel comfortable, it ends up blowing up in his face and he ends up looking like a pervert. Will Nana ever be able to convey her emotion to him and will Shinshi stop doing things that make him get mistaken for a perverted Lolicon?\n\n(Source: Mangaupdates)",
