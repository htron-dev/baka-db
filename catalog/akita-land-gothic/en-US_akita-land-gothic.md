## Sinopse

This is a story that takes place in a certain prefecture in the north. In contrast to the few daylight hours it gets, its people are cheerful if a bit eccentric.

Among them is Akita, a horned girl. A naturally argumentative and positive child, she lives happily every day. Spicing up her life is Asahi, her slightly odd childhood friend, and Komachi, a city girl who isn't quite used to life in the prefecture yet. There's also Akita's elder sister, a member of the Girl Scouts... Wait, what's her name, again?
