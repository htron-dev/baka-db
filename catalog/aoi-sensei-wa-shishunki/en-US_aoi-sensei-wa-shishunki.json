Mail, phone, dates, kisses…anything lover-like are all banned! It's a relationship where they will break up if there's even a rumor about them. Because of that, the feelings of love must be protected...\n\nIt is a pure and restricted love with the serious biology teacher, the love of a heart throbbing every day will begin!\n\n(Source: Chibi Manga)",
