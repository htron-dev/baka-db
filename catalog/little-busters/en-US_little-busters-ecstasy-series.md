## Sinopse

The main additions in Little Busters! Ecstasy are 3 heroine routes involving the characters Tokido Saya, Sasasegawa Sasami and Futaki Kanata.

Volume 1: Tokido Saya - School Revolution
Saya is part of a special prefectorial board that aims to eliminate a dark association and, in the process, she drags Riki Naoe into the mayhem as back-up! Riki, not quite sure what's going on, is pretty sure all this is a plot by his senior, Kyousuke Natsume. Will Riki be able to get out of all the madness or will he get himself killed before he even tries?
