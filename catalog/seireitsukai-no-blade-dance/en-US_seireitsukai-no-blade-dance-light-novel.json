Therefore nations race to produce the next Ren Ashbell, \"The Strongest Blade Dancer,\" and only spirit elementalers, who are all pure young maidens, are able to qualify.\n\nSixteen-year-old Kamito Kazehaya, the only male spirit elementaler, is forced to attend Areishia Spirit Academy, where he meets other spirit contractors around his age. One of these is the red-haired Claire Rouge, who insists that Kamito become her contracted humanoid spirit. But Kamito cannot forget his one and only wish: to take back his former partner, Restia Ashdoll.\n\nJoin Kamito as he, with the help of his sword spirit Terminus Est, seeks to become the next champion in the upcoming Blade Dance of the Elementalers!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
