## Sinopse

Kaguya-sama wo Kataritai follows the daily antics of two members of Shuchiin Academy's Mass Media Club, Erika Kose and Karen Kino. Erika is a fervent admirer of Student Council Vice-President Kaguya Shinomiya, while Karen loves the idea of President Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya as a couple. As a result, their delusional minds are filled to the brim with horribly misguided ideas on how their seemingly perfect idols actually behave!
