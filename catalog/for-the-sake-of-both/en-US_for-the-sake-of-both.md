## Sinopse

Though we often regret what we say,
it is still impossible to undo those mistakes.
Even in proverbs they teach "think thrice before you say it".
Yet, if there is something you want to change no matter what
and there appears a time machine,
Would you use it?
I know I would.

"Even if I dedicated my life to music,
My heart beats with you.
How can I live-
How can you leave me."

"As my heart beats at another boy,
I thought it was over between you and me.
If I said I wanted to go back to the way it was...
Cruel?"
