## Sinopse

Hina, Arare, and Hana are the three sisters of Kyoto's oldest confectionery shop, Fukuya. Although they each have different personalities, they all take pride in their shop.

Fukuyadou Honpo will bring you a taste of the ancient capital, Kyoto, with a shrewd mother, sharp-tongued grandpa, and a host of other characters who bring life to the great city.
