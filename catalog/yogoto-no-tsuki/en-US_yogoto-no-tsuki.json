    "sinopse": "Fresh-faced artist, Kojima Yoshimi, used to be the lover of the art gallery’s owner, Shibano. While diverting more of his attention upon his work, another man suddenly steps into the picture, and he apparently cares very deeply for Yoshimi… other than the titled story, “Yogoto no Tsuki,” this book also includes the expressive, heartfelt tales of young players; isolated, top-class businessmen; and the thin and fragile love between males.\n(from B-U)",
