## Sinopse

Suikoden is the adaption of Water Margin, one of the four great Chinese classical novels. The original story tells how a group of 108 outlaws are granted amnesty when they form an army to resist foreign invaders and suppress rebel forces. Winding through the maze of political and social ancient China, their adventure brings them up against the apathy and conservatism of the current government, where very little regard exists for the truly brave.
