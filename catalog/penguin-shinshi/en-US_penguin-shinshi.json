But little do the patrons know that these handsome gents are actually penguins in disguise! The sharply-dressed flightless birds love all that the human world offers, but as the saying goes: \"You can take the penguin out of the Antarctic, but you can't take the Antarctic out of the penguin!\"\\*\n\n\\*Not all penguins come from the Antarctic.\\*\\*\\*\\* Yes, this actually matters in the world of Penguin Gentlemen.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
