    "sinopse": "Nohae has been crushing on Dona, his neighbor, since they were younger. Dona is a girl who was obsessed with money as a child and would make her childhood friend Nohae actually pay her. Time has passed and now she's a teen, broke and living on the streets with her dad. Her dad meets Nohae and arranges for Dona to live with him. But Dona's not your typical heroine. She's one of those fake people, maintaining a perfect image at school but in front of her parents she's self-absorbed, a glutton, and is quick to nab a meal or swindle money. She's quick to anger and has a grudge against Nohae, but he likes her so much he's completely unaware.\n\n(Souce: ajmanga)",
