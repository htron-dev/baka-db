    "sinopse": "After his heart skips a beat at the sight of his childhood friend Haname's smile, Arashi somehow awakens in a hospital bed...?! His body is covered in countless heart-shaped rashes. In order to suppress the effects of the allergic reaction caused by feelings of love (a.k.a. Lovesickness), he was prescribed heart-shaped pills to control his love. Since that day, \"love\" was stolen from him... He can kiss and have sex, but he doesn't know how to love...?! Pay attention to the heart-shaped rashes! This is the heart-patterned, pure love-sick love of two childhood friends restrained from love by a love allergy!\n\n(Source: Takeshobo, translated)",
