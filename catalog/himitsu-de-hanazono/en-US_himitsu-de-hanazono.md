## Sinopse

A normal high school student, Ryou falls in love with the angelic young master, Minato.

But the three butlers living with Minato are much too overprotective of him, when Ryou wants to get intimate with Minato for a moment, he's always interrupted by the three; with three \*light bulbs forcing themselves between the pair of lovers, what is to be done?

\*light bulbs are something like a third wheel; an extra person who intrudes on a couple spending time together.
