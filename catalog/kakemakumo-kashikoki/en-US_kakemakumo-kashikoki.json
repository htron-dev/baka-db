    "sinopse": "It's his long-awaited wedding day, and the Fox Spirit of the Silver Order, Ginrei, is making his marital vows towards his long-time fiancee Menou, the Fox Princess of the Agate.\n\nMeet Handa Shin; 23, jobless, homeless, and currently taking shelter from an unexpected summer shower in Ginrei's shrine. Catching sight of the food that has been placed there as offering, he devours it, nonchalantly remarking that he'd \"agree to become the bride of the fox spirit\" if it meant he would get to eat such delicious meals everyday...\n\n(Source: MU)",
