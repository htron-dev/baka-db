## Sinopse

A girl with nothing to her name and no blood relations embarked on a journey to find work only to find herself in an unfortunate accident... the time between the incident and her waking in an unfamiliar mansion are vague, but it seems as if she had been rescued by a man named Levi. However is this a blessing or a nightmare?
