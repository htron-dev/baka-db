    "sinopse": "The J-pop group Mini Moni has opened a cheerful little cake shop. Leader Mika-chan struggles to keep Aibon and Nono from causing trouble, all the while teaching new member Ai-chan the ropes. Regular customers include lively flower shop owner Yaguchi-san, and her flight attendant friend Gocchin, who is constantly trying to impress everyone with her non-existent knowledge of the places she claims her job has taken her.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
