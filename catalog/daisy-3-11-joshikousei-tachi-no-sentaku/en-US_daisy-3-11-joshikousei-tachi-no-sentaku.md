## Sinopse

The manga, based on the novel Pierrot ~Yoake Mae~ by Teruhiro Kobayashi, Darai Kusanagi, and Tomoji Nobuta, tells the story of four friends at a girl's high school in Fukushima Prefecture that is feared to have been radioactively contaminated. One of the four committed suicide a month after her college student fiancee told her that he was afraid of having a child with her because he did not want an unhealthy child.
