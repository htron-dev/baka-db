## Sinopse

Navagraha: DefenD 9 Triggers is set in a world where nine people known as the "Kuyou" can summon the power of Buddha to become the strongest people in the world to fight evil. Akira and Sakuya, former Kuyou who lost their powers, live a life of regret. But when a threat arises, they stand up to fight for what is important to them. Now they must find a way to reclaim the power of Buddha, and stand against Vishuddha, which is searching for a hibutsu (hidden Buddhist image) in order to destroy the world.
