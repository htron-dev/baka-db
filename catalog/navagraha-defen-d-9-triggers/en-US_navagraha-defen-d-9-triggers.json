Akira and Sakuya, former Kuyou who lost their powers, live a life of regret. But when a threat arises, they stand up to fight for what is important to them. Now they must find a way to reclaim the power of Buddha, and stand against Vishuddha, which is searching for a hibutsu (hidden Buddhist image) in order to destroy the world.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
