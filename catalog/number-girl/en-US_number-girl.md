## Sinopse

A 4-koma following a group of sixteen identically cloned middle-school girls attending school in Japan. Each girl is known only by the number imprinted on their right eye, 1 through 16 respectively. Under the instruction of a quick-to-anger Teacher and her fellow "common sense instructor" named Azuma (whose teachings the girls completely disregard), each of the girls develop their own distinct personalities. As clones with no prior life experience and lacking common sense, they are not hesitant to speak their minds freely, which frequently brings the wrath of their instructor upon them.
