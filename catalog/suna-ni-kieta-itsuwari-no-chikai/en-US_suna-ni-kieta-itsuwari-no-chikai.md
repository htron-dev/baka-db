## Sinopse

She'll trick the world by playing the part of a horrible wife, all for his sake...

Upright and serious secretary Emily is always being confronted with her handsome boss's woman troubles. Not only is Kadir a talented businessman who regularly travels around the world, he's also the prince of a bountiful desert kingdom. And he has a prodigious talent for attracting women. One day, after Kadir receives an emergency message from his home country, he makes an outrageous request: he'll pay Emily a huge sum if she pretends to be his horrible wife! Just what does he have planned?
