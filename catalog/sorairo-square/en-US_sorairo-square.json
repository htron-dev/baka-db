    "sinopse": "A story based around three childhood friends: Miyuki, a girl who lost her memory; Fumika, a girl who is currently a super idol; and Shuuichi, a childhood friend of Miyuki and Fumika, who likes to take photographs. Two years ago, Miyuki lost her memory in an accident and she became distant from people but somehow she is beginning to open her heart to Shuuichi. Their relationship seems like more than just friends but less than lovers. Now however, Fumika has taken a break from being an idol and has returned from Tokyo to see Shuuichi. The feelings of these three overlap.\n\n(Source: Fairgame)",
