## Sinopse

The Japanese government has commissioned a 22-minute anime video called "Bokura no Saibanin Monogatari" (Our Jury Story) to teach its citizens about the re-introduced jury system. In July, Japan will implement jury trials for the first time in six decades, so most Japanese have never experienced jury duty. The anime uses a high school boy's one-sided infatuation for a classmate as an unusual segue to discuss the jury system.

Omnibus Japan and Tomason produced the animation in collaboration with Group TAC and Studio Cj. Veteran voice actress Minami Takayama (Detective Conan's Conan, Kiki's Delivery Service's Kiki and Ursula) plays the lovestruck boy Shōta alongside fellow cast members Yuki Tashiro, Daisuke Sakaguchi (Clannad's Youhei Sunohara), and Akeno Watanabe (To Love-Ru's Rito Yūki).
