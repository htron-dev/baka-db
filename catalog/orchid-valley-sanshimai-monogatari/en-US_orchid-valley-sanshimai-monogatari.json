    "sinopse": "\"Love is just a waste of time!\" claims Valerie, a successful company executive. Always cool and collected, she even acts calm at the news of her father's critical illness. However her father's physician Colby sees through Valerie's cold exterior to discover a tender loneliness. He becomes attracted to the tough acting yet frail Valerie. One day, seeing her weeping quietly, he embraces her and comforts her with a kiss. Valerie don't have to hold back her tears when she is in front of Colby. While desiring each other deeply, an invisible wall continues to divide the career-orientated Valerie, and Colby, who longs for a traditional woman. Will their love eventually break through this wall?\n\n(Source: Jmanga)",
