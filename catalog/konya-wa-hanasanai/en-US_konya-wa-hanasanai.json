    "sinopse": "Nora works at a newspaper as the etiquette columnist, but she doesn't limit her advice to the printed page. She's often telling people in the office how to act, which has gotten her a reputation for being high-strung and uptight. Fed up with the way they see her, Nora decides to get her groove back. With the help of a friend, she puts on a disguise, gets dressed up in a sexy little dress and prepares to have a night out on the town. The first man who approaches her is none other than her colleague Pete. Nora keeps up the front and acts like she doesn't know him. Pete doesn't seem to recognize her, and they share a passionate kiss... before ending up in bed together!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
