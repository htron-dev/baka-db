Mugi tries to break into her sister's high school, Shoukei Academy, one of those super elite high schools, to find evidence, but she is almost hurt by a guard dog when she's saved by Kazuya Midou, a rich and powerful student. He makes a deal with her that she can look around the school as a substitute teacher if she acts as a housekeeper for him and his three male boarders - who happen to also be very popular Shoukei students.\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Baby Love\nVolume 4: My Fiendly Robot\nVolume 6: Fairy Tale",
