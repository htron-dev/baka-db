## Sinopse

My name is Megumi Tsukuba, and I'm nicknamed "Gumi." I have no sense of athletics, but when I saw figure skating, I had an urge to become a sparkling skater. The practice is severe every day, but I feel most fulfilled skating. I attended a skating tournament for the first time, and was selected as a representative athlete together with Shogo for the prefecture...!?
