    "sinopse": "Technology has now allowed people to be numerically categorized based on their psychological, physical, and emotional traits. People have begun using this technology to standardize what everyone considers a \"good way to live.\" They call this system \"PSYCHO-PASS.\"\n\nAlthough all people know the standard \"good way to live,\" crime still occurs. Kougami Shinya and his colleagues are part of the governmental agency that apprehends individuals deemed lacking under the PSYCHO-PASS standard. His agency are actually comprised of individuals who were once found to be problematic for society. They are now the dogs of the government.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
