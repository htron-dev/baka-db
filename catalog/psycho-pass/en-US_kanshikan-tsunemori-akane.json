    "sinopse": "In the near future, it is possible to instantaneously measure a person's mental state, personality, and the probability that a person will commit crimes with technology called the Dominator. Just thinking about a crime can make you guilty, and in this world there is no mercy for criminals. Detectives work in pairs (one Enforcer and one Inspector) with Enforcers delivering lethal justice, and Inspectors making sure their partners don't take things too far.\n\n(Source: MU)",
