## Sinopse

Centered around two rookie inspectors of the Ministry of Welfare's Public Safety Bureau (MWPSB); Arata Shindou and Kei Mikhail Ignatov. These two inspectors are confronted with an ever changing society under the jurisdiction of the all knowing and impartial system of collective consciousness known as Sibyl and a contradiction that exists solely to evince the imperfections of the Sibyl system. Contending with an increasing anti immigrant sentiment, political intrigue, as well as peculiar individuals who exist solely to test the Sibyl system, these two inspectors are confronted with two choices, which are to either follow or overturn the system.
