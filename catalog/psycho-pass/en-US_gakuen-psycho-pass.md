## Sinopse

Another version of the story of the Inspectors and Enforcers from Psycho-Pass, but this time in chibi style! All of the main characters are now in chibi form, and are attending a "Psycho-Pass Academy," which is basically a chibi-fied version of the scenario of the original series. New student Tsunemori and her classmates will use their Dominators to keep their school's peace!
