## Sinopse

Ami Won's late mother always told her to grow up to be an exemplary woman. And the chance presents itself now that her dad has been elected President of Korea. Thus begins this klutzy girl's transformation into the girl her mother had always hoped she'd become. However, in the spotlight and imbued with a kind of social power she never expected, Ami is now beset on all sides by the jealous and dismayed. Her cousin Bi-Na leads this parade. Bi-Na considers herself naturally charismatic and infinitely more charming, so she feels she deserves the role as Korea's First Lady.
