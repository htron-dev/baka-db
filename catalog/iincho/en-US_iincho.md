## Sinopse

The first year middle school Student Council Chairpersons come from different elementary schools and different backgrounds. These six cute, glasses-wearing middle school girls often fight, but they have a common enemy in the sexual-harassing Student Council President. Will they be able to do their job without being distracted by infighting or thwarted by the controlling Student Council President?
