## Sinopse

Let us talk about when man first sailed into space.

It was around sixty years ago, during the First World War. It was a time without the complete emblem gravity engines we have today and a time before the identity of the moon was known. The stage was set in the iron city, Panzerpolis Berlin. There, some people wished to visit space to an almost reckless degree. This story's protagonists are those people. Now, are you ready?

Then let the story begin.
