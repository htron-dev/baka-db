## Sinopse

Rena may only be in high school, but she already has an important job -- she's a successful shoujo mangaka! When she decides that some experience with dating is necessary to draw better romances, she chooses famous actor Tomoya to help her learn what it's like to be in love. Even though they're dating strictly for business' sake, Rena finds herself falling deeply in love with Tomoya. Seems like romance is a lot harder than it looks in manga!

Included one-shots:
Volume 1: Magical☆Project
Volume 2: Bewildered♥Princess
