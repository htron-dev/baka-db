## Sinopse

Fuminori Sakisaka, a young man who lost his family in a tragic car accident, has his life saved through an untested surgical procedure. However, thanks to a strange side-effect, all that comes upon his eyes appears twisted and ugly. All except for the beautiful girl who goes by "Saya", who draws the color of beauty to Fuminori's stained existence. For him, she is the only strand of light still remaining in life.
