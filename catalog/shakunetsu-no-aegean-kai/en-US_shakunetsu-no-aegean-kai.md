## Sinopse

Charlotte, who is a journalist, meets Iannis with sculpturelike beautiful coal-black hair on the Greek island of Iskos! With a desire to write about him, Charlotte approaches him and finds herself smitten; he has an arrogant side, but also gentlemanlike elegance. The two indulge in a passionate love affair, but one incident generates a doubt...!
