    "sinopse": "There lives a man who has lost his memory and can't remember where he's from, and who he is, including his name. He just goes by the name Matsumoto and the one and only thing he remembers is how to play soccer. However, the one thing he does remember, he does exceptionally well, even better than the professionals. He sells his ridiculous soccer skills to teams and guarantees them goals and, even more important, wins. As he travels from city to city, country to country playing for money, he hopes that he regains his memory.\n\n(Source: MU)",
