## Sinopse

Dancer Sylvie was appalled when ruthless businessman Arkim kissed her at a party. Worst of all, he's engaged to her sister! So when Sylvie showed up at their wedding, she lied in front of everyone, saying she and Arkim had slept together in order to save her sister, who didn't want to marry him. Several days later, Sylvie received an offer to perform in a desert country, but it turns out the job was just a trap laid by Arkim to bring her to him. Sylvie hates Arkim, yet her treacherous body heats up whenever he's near!
