    "sinopse": "Bella Lawrence can't hide her disappointment after she loses the auction for a painting that she wanted to get for her grandmother's birthday present. Instead the work went to a man with a hard face and a confident smile. So she is pleased when the same man, Olivier, shows up at her grandmother's birthday party. When he asks Bella to go on a date, she is enthralled by his magical words. How could she possibly know that this is all part of Olivier's plan for revenge on the Lawrence family.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
