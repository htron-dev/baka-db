## Sinopse

"Please no more...Save me, Nakamuraaah...!"

With the stress from work and his girlfriend, Seta's body, mind and spirit are all reaching their breaking point. Then along comes his subordinate and body pillow fanatic Nakamura, who proposes that they become sleep buddies (friends who sleep next to each other). With his mental state stretched to its limits, he decides to try it; but seriously, with a guy?! But...why does it feel so nice to be enveloped in the strong arms of his brash subordinate?
