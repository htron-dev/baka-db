## Sinopse

Makoto is a friendless, unhappy teenager who lives with his grandmother after the suicide of his father. He cannot see anything visibly special about himself, so he is bewildered when one of the most popular guys in school, Yuuki, begins to seek out his company. Yuuki, a long-haired rebel who is very popular with the ladies, fills Makoto's head with ideas of obliterating the corruption of the current society through the power of destruction. Yuuki almost seems to have guessed what Makoto is hiding: a powerful supernatural ability. How far will Makoto be willing to follow Yuuki's destructive ambitions?
