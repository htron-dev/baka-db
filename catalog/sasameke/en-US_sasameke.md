## Sinopse

Elementary school soccer whiz Rakuichi Nagahama drew national attention a few years back with his impressive athletic skills. After disappearing to Italy for three years, Rakuichi reluctantly returns to the remote town where he grew up. The local high school soccer team can’t wait to get their hands on the prodigy, despite the fact that he was obviously a failure in Italy. But Rakuichi’s not sure he’s ready to get back on the field. Sure, his best friend from elementary school (now a hot babe) can’t wait to see him play again...and his childhood rivals are eager to have another go against him...and the entire school is counting on him...but how can Rakuichi live up to their expectations when he’s sworn off the sport for good?
