## Sinopse

"Awake."

After waking up from hearing this word, the first thing that I saw, is this foreign world.

For the sake of surviving in this game-like world of Grimgar, we can only remove our hesitation and fight... But sorry, I don't like to follow the path that was arranged for me, I will only walk the path that I desire.
