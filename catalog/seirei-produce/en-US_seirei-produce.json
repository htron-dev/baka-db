    "sinopse": "Shiina Momose doesn't believe in fortune telling and the occult, but for some reason, she can destroy anything with a touch. One day while on her way to school, a young man approaches her and claims to be a God. Furthermore, he believes that he was guided towards her and for that reason he has become convinced that she should become his first follower! Naturally, Momose refuses; but when strange things began to happen... she can't not do something about it!\n\n(Source: MU)",
