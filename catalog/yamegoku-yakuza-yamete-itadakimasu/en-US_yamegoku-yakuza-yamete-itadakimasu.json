    "sinopse": "Nagamitsu Bakushuu is an adviser in the \"Clean Break Helpline\" (commonly called \"Ashinuke Call\")—a special unit in the Organized Crime Department at Tokyo Metropolitan Police which helps those who want to make a clean break from a gang group. Although she treats gang member clients like \"scum,\" she goes far beyond her responsibility to help them quit the organization by getting a written agreement from the gang boss and finding jobs for them afterwards. Also, her colleague and a former detective at the Organized Crime Department—Mikajima Kakeru doesn't get along with Bakushuu.\n\nOne day \"Clean Break Helpline\" receives a call from a client. He is the leader of a gang group under the umbrella of a designated organized crime group \"Kanto Kifune-gumi,\" and claims that he already made an apology to the boss—Tachibana Isao. The client says that his group has got in trouble because of Bakushuu...\n\n(Source: TBS, DramaWiki)",
