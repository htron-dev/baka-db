    "sinopse": "Recently graduated Suzumura Rikako was still jobless when her older sister insisted that she apply to the company that she was working for. It sounds really great except for the part where that company is an erotic game developer. Rikako has yet to embrace her sexuality and add to that her shy personality and you have a recipe for disaster. But with all the employees, from the designers to programmers to advertising, being cute females, maybe Rikako won't have such a hard time making this her career, or maybe it just might make it even more awkward.\n\n(Source: MU)",
