## Sinopse

Yuniko Sakuraba isn't your ordinary 15-year-old girl. She is a die hard fan of the late actor Akira Nanae and she became a thief in an effort to recover and collect Akira's stolen memorabilia.

She then encounters, the 17-year-old actor Ryu Eba who has been labeled as the "New Nanae." She tries to steal his award which formerly belonged to Akira but is discovered. On the other hand, Ryu seems taken by the unique girl and offers to give her the award if she can steal it again. On the other hand, mystery surrounds Yuniko's past as she finds out that her mother, a former actress and who she hasn't seen because of her mother's illness has actually an amnesia and Akira's death has something to do with it!
