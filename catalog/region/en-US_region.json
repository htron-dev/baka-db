    "sinopse": "The month is February, but it hasn't snowed all winter. Kanon's father is often away on business trips and might be getting a little too friendly with his pretty young female subordinate; which Kanon doesn't approve of so soon after her mother's death. Her little brother collects insects, but they're dying off.\n\nIt turns out that these deaths are the first of many a plague to come down. First it's the insects, inexplicably dropping dead everywhere. Then it's the rats, looking for a new food source. And things just keep getting worse…\n\n(Source: MU)",
