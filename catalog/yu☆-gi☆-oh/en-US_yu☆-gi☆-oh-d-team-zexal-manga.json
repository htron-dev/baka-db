    "sinopse": "In contrast to the first manga, this one focuses on humor and all characters are drawn in a chibi style. Different from the canon series, which aim at a juvenile public, this manga series aims at younger children, and teaches them how to play the Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG with a light and humored plot.\n\nIn this story, Yuma Tsukumo, Tori Meadows, Caswell Todoroki, and Bronk Stone form a Dueling Team named ZEXAL. Also, Yuma knows Astral since the beginning, but he is still the only one who can see him.\n\n(Source: Yu-Gi-Oh! Wikia)",
