## Sinopse

Myoujin is a guide for spirits. Unlike most people, he can see ghosts, ghosts who live and wander in the same world we do. But he's got something even more special up his sleeve: he can touch them. Okegawa Himeno is an ordinary 16 year-old girl studying in Tokyo. But now she's become Myoujin's housemate, infact, he's her landlord. After a close brush with death herself, Himeno becomes able to see the walking dead herself. At least now she's able to meet her neighbours.
