    "sinopse": "The Godai family has always been in the money lending business, and Minoru is no exception to the rule. But what he didn't expect was that a trip to collect a man's unpaid debt would lead to him picking a lot more. After 11 years of taking care of Fuutarou, Minoru finally notices that all his discipline has been in vain. Will Fuutarou ever get his reward?\n\n(Source: MU)",
