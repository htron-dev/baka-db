    "sinopse": "\"The Pretty Guardian in a Sailor Suit! Sailor Venus has arrived!\"\n\n13-year-old Minako Aino is an active tomboy who loves idols and video games, and is a popular member of Shiba Koen Junior High School's volleyball team. One day during her PE class, Minako accidentally stumbles upon a white cat, who later sidetracks her from talking to her crush. At home, Minako wonders if she is beautiful, and hearing this, the cat introduces himself as Artemis and gives her a compact mirror that shows Minako more than just her beauty...\n\nBefore she can fully take in the cat's words, Minako receives a special pen that can transform her into masked champion of justice, Sailor V! As her carefree love-seeking days begin to include adventures against the energy-seeking Dark Agency, Minako will learn to embrace the full extent of her destiny in this prequel to Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
