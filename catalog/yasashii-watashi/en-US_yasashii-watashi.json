    "sinopse": "Seriu meets Yae, an older woman in the photography club, who's also a celebrity at her university known for her free-spirited speech and mannerisms—especially her magnificent travels from man to man! What's intriguing, though, is their relationship. Frustrated and formerly part of the tennis club, Seriu thinks that his girlfriend is just a bit of heavy baggage, but he unexpectedly gets off to a good start with her! Even though they hurt each other with their honest confessions, they grow with each other. Yasashii Watashi is essentially a compassionate romantic drama set in a university setting.\n\n(Source: Entropy)",
