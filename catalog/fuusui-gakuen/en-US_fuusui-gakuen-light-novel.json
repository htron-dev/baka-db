Their job is to apply feng shui and other spiritual methods in architecture to exterminate fiends and demons in Tokyo, where the protective feng shui seal has been broken due to wars and urban development. Being raised by a spider fiend, Ozunu has always tried to purify or return monsters to where they came from. He clashes with his rival Tsugaru, the heir to a magical architecture corporation, who believes strength is the key to everything.",
