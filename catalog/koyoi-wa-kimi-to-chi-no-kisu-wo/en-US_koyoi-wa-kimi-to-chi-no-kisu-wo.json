    "sinopse": "While delivering flowers for his part-time job, Riku finds himself at a strange mansion inhabited by three beautiful (and otherworldly) young men. Though he escapes with his life, Riku is soon plagued by vicious nightmares: visions of cold fingers stroking his body, and kisses so deadly that he might be devoured whole! Does the beautiful-yet-demonic master of the mansion hold the secret to this strange turn of events? A Bloody Kiss Tonight brings gorgeous vampires and their unsuspecting victims together in a dance death (and lust) that spans decades! Beautiful Keito has hunted down the same innocent man time and time again…but in each pursuit, his favorite prey has had a different human incarnation. Will Riku realize that he’s the chosen one? And will he embrace his singular fate… or fight back?\n\n(Source: Jmanga)",
