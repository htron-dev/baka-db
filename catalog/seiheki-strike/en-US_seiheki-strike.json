On his way to his new dorm, Taichi spots an incredibly handsome guy on the train, and accidentally gropes him! Later, it turns out the guy he groped is his new roommate, Shinobu Seto! Taichi knows it's wrong, but he keeps getting turned on at the worst possible moments... He had no idea he had it in him! Despite his best efforts not to bother Shinobu anymore, Taichi ends up jerking him off, and all kinds of other accidental antics happen! He's going out of his mind!
