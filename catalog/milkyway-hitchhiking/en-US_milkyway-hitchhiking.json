    "sinopse": "There are as many people on Earth as there are stars in the sky. Milkyway-a peculiar cat with a pattern of the Milky Way splashed across her back-travels across time and space; sometimes to observe, other times to interact with an unfolding story. From Sirial, the creator of One Fine Day, comes the full-color tale of Milkyway hitchhiking across the bright stars of people’s lives, loves, tears, and laughter.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
