    "sinopse": "Mayu Koida works as a fashion stylist because she views it as a trendy profession, but her efforts are always half-hearted at best. She chooses to neglect her assignments whenever involved with a new boyfriend, and her self-confidence is wrapped up in looking good and feeling loved.\n\nOn the other hand, Yuka Shimizu has devoted her life to becoming a professional mixed martial artist ever since graduating from high school. She has forsaken things that would make others her age happy: friends, marriage, and motherhood. Her greatest wish is to debut successfully as a fighter in the featherweight division, proving that all her past sacrifices have been worthwhile.\n\nWhat will happen when these two women with nothing in common end up as housemates? Can they influence each other for the better, or will their respective weaknesses weigh them both down?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
