## Sinopse

Maki lives with a family that's very dependent and demanding of him. He finds relief with Tasku, a young looking man who cant seem to do anything himself. Being more than happy to help Tasku out, as he is finally given a thank you for his efforts, he easily falls for the younger looking man. Things are happy between them until Maki learns just who Tasku is, and then misadventures ensue.
