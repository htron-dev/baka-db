## Sinopse

Average junior high school student Kei Aramaki finds out one day that he's actually the banished prince of the undersea Anchovie Kingdom. Furthermore, he finds out that his kingdom was betrayed by Smoke, a trusted retainer who helped the Hondawara Empire in plotting the destruction of his erstwhile kingdom.

Kei has to figure out how to defeat the Hondawara Empire while avoiding a pointless battle with Imperial Princess Okiamisu.

An homage to and parody of Osamu Tezuka's "Umi no Triton". Originally ran in special issues of "Weekly Shounen Sunday"
