## Sinopse

Mutou Ginji runs an izakaya, but his half-baked approach to cooking leaves it on the verge of closing. One day, he falls into a well at a temple, and finds himself in the Edo era, where he meets a brother and sister who are responsible for the shogun's meals. Two eras of cuisine collide as Ginji showcases modern Japanese dishes while learning about delicious dishes from the Edo era.

[Written by Denji]
