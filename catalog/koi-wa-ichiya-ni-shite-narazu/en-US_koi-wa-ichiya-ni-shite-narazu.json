Igawa thinks that it all started when Takagi collapsed during training retreat and Igawa insisted on carrying him to the infirmary which hurt Takagi's pride. Now, their boss has threatened them to either start getting along or else their bonuses will be withheld. How will these two ever get along?! (Source: B-U)",
