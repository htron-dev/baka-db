    "sinopse": "This summer, I lost you a second time.\n\nSurely, the words 'I like you' were a crime.\n\nMoriyama Rin was born with an incurable disease.\nI came to love the girl who spent her high school life hiding that fact.\nAt our last cultural festival, we had our live concert and spent the last moments of the festival together--After that, Rin died.\n\nIn her final moments, I told to her 'I like you' --I told her the message that I should have never conveyed. When I arrived at the her hospital room, I received a slip of paper with only the words 'I'm sorry'.\n\nI shouldn't have told those feelings.\nSomeone like me shouldn't have gotten close to Rin.\n\nThen, I experienced a time leap.\nAt the riverside where we first met, I met her once more,\nthe Rin who I always wanted to see again, to see that radiant simile once more...\n\nThat's why this time I won't make the same mistake.\nBecause I definitely cannot convey these feelings.\n\nI decided that to the very end, I must repress my own feelings.\nIn hopes she would always be smiling in her one short life.\n\n(Source: Amazon)",
