Born into the pleasure quarters and raised as a courtesan, he knows that emotions are fickle things, changing with every hour. But when a rich man's son visits Misao's teahouse, Misao opens his heart for the first time. He pursues this reckless love on the cusp between two ages, yearning only for happiness and expecting nothing but pain. Can the world ever change for this prisoner of love?",
