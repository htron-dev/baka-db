## Sinopse

"Aaah, A peaceful life is boring."

After the final battle in the first series, Joukyuu has been staying quiet in Japan teaching martial arts. Even with Veronica and Kageyasu close by, it's so boring. Then suddenly a chef (who happens to be a karate master) offers him a quick trip too the US to mess with their gangs, in return for great Japanese food, he jumps at the chance. Dragging both girls with him, along with Bull for good measure, he arrives in America like a typhoon. Will they survive their trip?
