## Sinopse

Chitose is eager to fall in love, and she thinks she's found the perfect candidate in Yamato. Yamato is good-looking, considerate...and a little bit of a delinquent! Chitose discovers that Yamato takes money for kisses and dates! Chitose wants Yamato's lips for herself, but she has absolutely no intention of paying for them. Look out, Yamato, because Chitose -- a refreshingly spirited heroine -- is out to Get Chu! (Source: Shoujomagic)
