    "sinopse": "Novice voice actor Souhei Seta woke up not only in a strange bed, but COMPLETELY NAKED! What’s worse, there was a naked man on either side of him! Who are these men? One is the mature, popular script writer Enji Shindou; the other is his brother: popular voice actor Kenzou Morita. Souhei is trying to make it as a voice actor, but finds that being around these two men is making him very distracted. Can a young voice actor mix work and romance? If so, which man will finally win his heart?\n\n(Source: DMP)",
