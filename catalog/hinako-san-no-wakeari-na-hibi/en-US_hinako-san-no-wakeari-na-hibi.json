    "sinopse": "Hinako is a 36-year-old single grandmother, but she doesn't look like it, and certainly doesn't act like it. She still yearns for the love and marriage that she never had, and hopes to turn over a new leaf with her new job, but she ends up getting a lot more than she bargained for after a young model confesses to her.\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)",
