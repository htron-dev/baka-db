One day in Shibuya, she's handled roughly by a gang leader named Kyou, who insists he will make her his woman unless she can produce a boyfriend. Shinobu turns to her unrequited love, a true gentleman named Hibiki, the utter opposite of Kyou, and begs him to play the part.

He acts like the kind of boy Kumi normally hates, and since her awful first kiss she hates kissing, but Takafumi's kisses leave a different kind of mark...",
