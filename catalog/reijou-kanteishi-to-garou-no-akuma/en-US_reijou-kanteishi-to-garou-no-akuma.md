## Sinopse

"Let's make a contract. You will be owned by me."

"I shall serve you as if I loved you, my lady."

Riz, a count's daughter and a lover of paintings, is told "Give yourself to me" by John, the temporary art gallery manager employed by her uncle. However, those words weren't of love or romance, but because he wanted the "Holy Eyes" that could see the demons lurking in paintings which Riz had. Pressed into a contract by John, who was actually a demon, the response Riz gave was that she was going to own the demon?!

This is an art-centric romantic fantasy between a unconventional young lady and a sharp-tongued demon!
