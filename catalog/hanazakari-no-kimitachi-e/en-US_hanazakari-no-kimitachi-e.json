To be close to her idol, high jumper Izumi Sano, she's going to an all-guys' high school...and disguising herself as a boy! But as fate would have it, they're more than classmates...they're roommates! Now, Mizuki must keep her secret in the classroom, the locker room, and her own bedroom. And her classmates—and the school nurse—must cope with a new transfer student who may make them question their own orientation...\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Natsu no Ori (The Cage of Summer)\nVolume 4: Kawaki no Tsuki (The Thirsty Moon)",
