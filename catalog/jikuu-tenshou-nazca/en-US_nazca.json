    "sinopse": "Kyogi Miura is a troubled boy who found peace thanks to his master, Tate, and the teachings of kendo. But during a kendo competition, Kyogi sees his master transform into an oddly dressed man with eyes full of wrath. Later, when Tate and him are sparring, he hallucinates and he finds himself in an unknown place that seems to call him. The place is Peru, and Tate explains that they're the reincarnations of ancient Incan warriors. After Tate vanishes, Kyogi decides to go to Peru to find out the truth... but he isn't the only person involved in this ancient war, and evil, as they say, never sleeps. (Source: Storm in Heaven)",
