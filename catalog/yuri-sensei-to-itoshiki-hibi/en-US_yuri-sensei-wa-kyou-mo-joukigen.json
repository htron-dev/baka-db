    "sinopse": "Young editor Muguruma has his hands full with high-maintenance mystery writer Yuri, whose outrageous demands and reluctance to meet deadlines have become infamous at Sogendo Publishing. But even patient Muguruma is not prepared for the confusion he feels when bad-tempered Yuri tries to woo him. Do his feelings for Yuri run deeper than simple respect and admiration? Set in post-occupation Japan, this meandering love story is as moody and charming as Yuri-sensei himself.\n\n(Source: DMG)",
