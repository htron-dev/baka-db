## Sinopse

In this sequel to "Yuri Sensei is in a Good Mood Today as Well", pure-hearted editor Muguruma continues his uneasy working relationship with mystery author Yuri, while also taking on a new writer, Sakura. While Sakura’s carefree, affectionate manner and unfailing punctuality make him highly desirable as a client, will he succeed in winning Muguruma’s heart as well? Now, faced with an arranged marriage and an attractive rival, it’s up to Yuri-sensei to make his true feelings clear.
