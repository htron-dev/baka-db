    "sinopse": "Matsudaira Yuichi thinks he's an ordinary salaryman, and one who isn't very good at his job. He doesn't know he has two hot, female, ninja bodyguards! Hattori Asuka and Kirino Saiko follow him everywhere to insure his safety, and they even interact with him directly in their guise as his coworkers. Another girl in his department, Kyoko, is actually a ninja of another clan that is after Yuichi's life. Will Yuichi be able to continue his ordinary life, completely oblivious to all the ninja action in the shadows?\n\n(Source: Managhelpers)",
