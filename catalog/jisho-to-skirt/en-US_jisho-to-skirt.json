    "sinopse": "People have always fantasized about that one girl or guy that you thought you never had a shot with or maybe never even considered. Whether they're your classmate, next door neighbor, co-worker or even that long time friend you thought was platonic, when that sexual tension reaches a threshold, men and women are unable to resist their basic instinct and procreate. Especially when it’s the first time, things get rough, wild and down right dirty.\n\n(Source: Project-H)\n\n1. Obenkyo Shiyouze! (Let's Study!)\n2.
