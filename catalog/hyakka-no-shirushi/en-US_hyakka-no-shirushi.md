## Sinopse

Hyakka is the guardian deity of the newly developed Ayasaki village. She's a freeloader who lives in the village's only cafe, Warabi. Like Ayasaki itself, her powers are still developing. As such, she has to draft the son of Warabi's owner, Akira, into helping her with her daily efforts.
