## Sinopse

"Yu-chan I’ve been wanting to see you this whole time, I’m presently going to Tokyo..."

Mugiko is a very energetic girl that was raised in a rural agricultural village within the mountain area. In order for her to see Yu-chan, who she was extremely close with when they were children, she transfers to a school in Tokyo. It has been three years since Mugiko has seen Yu-chan, but when they meet each other again he treats her coldly. Mugiko is shocked by this, but a very kind prince type boy appears…!?
