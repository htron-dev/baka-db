    "sinopse": "All over Japan, throughout the land, innumerable pieces of traditional pottery have been popping up. And the ones who have given a unique flair to every piece are known as the Yakimon!\n\nIn place of his absent father, the university student Clay Endou must take charge of the \"Homura Pottery House.\" There, he comes across four unique people who are collectively known as the Yakimon: Imari, Bizen, Kutani, and Mino. One tiresome piece, a second tiresome piece, the Yakimon seem to be fooling with him. Even so, Clay is committed to reviving the once-glorious art of pottery. Naturally, the road to this is riddled with challenges!\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
