Just as she is lost to her wounds, she hears a voice ring in her head.\n\n\"You have been defeated. Commencing termination countdown.\"\n\nDue to the counsel of the \"Night Guide (Guidance),\" she narrowly escapes death and awakens with an ability that ordinary people do not possesses.

With her positive nature and bold and carefree attitude, she throws herself into the heat of the battle while leveling up and making weapons.\n\n(Source: Shufu to Seikatsu-sha, translated)",
