## Sinopse

Satomi's mother has left her father, but Satomi still waits for her at the family stationery shop. When Satomi's father, who has become an otaku and given up on life, decides to close the shop, she begs him to turn it over to her instead. Yuuyake Rocket Pencil relates the struggles and triumphs of an elementary-school girl who runs a store on her own.
