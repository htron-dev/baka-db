## Sinopse

As working woman and plant fanatic Sayaka Kouno was heading home from a drinking party, she found a handsome man sitting in front of her apartment who says, "Please bring me home with you," like a dog. With no place for the unnamed man to go, the two begin living together, and their "delicious" love story begins.
