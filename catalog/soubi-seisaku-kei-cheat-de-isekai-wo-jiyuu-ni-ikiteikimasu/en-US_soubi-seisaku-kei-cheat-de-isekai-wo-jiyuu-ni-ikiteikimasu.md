## Sinopse

There's the ordinary 29-year-old salesman named Touji Akino who, one day, is suddenly brought to another world. However, it turns out that he was a byproduct of a kingdom's hero summoning ritual and, since the people around him have better skills and levels than he does, he is quickly kicked out of the kingdom. However, he has a unique cheat skill that allows him to look at the status of any object he is touching. Using this power, he resolves to live a slow life and attain a harem of cute girls and mascot characters.
