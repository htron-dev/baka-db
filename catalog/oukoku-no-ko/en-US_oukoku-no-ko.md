## Sinopse

One country's cruel custom: "leading the life of a stand-in..." Away from the center of the city in a theater, an actor, a boy called Robert, is asked to become the stand-in for Elisabeth, who has the right of succeeding to the throne. Is Robert to be swallowed by the things to come as the wheel of fortune starts to spin? Deceit, traps, hatred.
