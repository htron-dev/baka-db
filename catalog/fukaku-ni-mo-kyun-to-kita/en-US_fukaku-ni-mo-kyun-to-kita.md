## Sinopse

Mitsu is a girl who dedicated her youth to the junior high school track team; however, she retires after suffering from an injury. One day, her bag, which she dearly treasured, fell onto the train tracks. A boy then suddenly risks his life to retrieve her bag. Having missed her chance to say thank you, she finally meets him again in high school. Despite her efforts to thank him, the boy constantly gives Mitsu the cold shoulder...

This is a love story about an honest, straightforward girl and a cold, popular boy.
