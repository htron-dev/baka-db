## Sinopse

For various reasons, Kouta Kuramoto lives a plain life without TV, oblivious to fads and fashions as a completely out-of-touch high school student. One day, he begins pummeling a boy who suddenly appears in his yard, not realizing the boy is none other than world-famous, super-popular actor Tougou Kihara! Tougo takes to Kouta despite their first meeting and tips him handsomely to work as his attendant. Kouta can't help but accept Toga's proposition—but when he sees Tougo display his star aura on the set, Kouta sees a Tougo completely different from his snobbish, pushy, normal self. What happens next? This comic puts a super star and a high school pauper side-by-side for a story of star-crossed love!
