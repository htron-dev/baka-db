## Sinopse

The kingdom of Commons lies on the large continent to the north called Arcadia. Mitia Commons is the princess of the kingdom and so extremely shy that she has barely even ventured outside of the castle. Now, out of nowhere, her mother, the queen, declares that all Commons must go through a mission in order to become qualified for the throne. The mission requires Mitia to collect 4 powerful stones to complete a staff. By doing so, she will overcome her shyness. She must use a special type of magic that feeds on her embarrassment level along with her friends and bodyguards Sasha and Aty to complete her adventure.
