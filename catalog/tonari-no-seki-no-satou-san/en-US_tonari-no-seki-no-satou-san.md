Yamaguchi is a smart, rather popular boy who sits next to Satou-san, who just can't seem to do anything right. She doesn't do well in school, is awkward, and freezes up whenever the attention is on her.

As they slowly get to know each other, Yamaguchi's initial feeling of discomfort starts to change...
