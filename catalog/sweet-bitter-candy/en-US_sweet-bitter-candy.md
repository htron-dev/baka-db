## Sinopse

'Chidebu' is a combination of the Japanese words for short and fat, and it's also Kawaguchi Takafumi's high school nickname. When Kanaya, the cool guy he admires, calls him 'Fatty' on the day of their graduation, he's driven to drastic weight loss. What will Kanaya think when they meet again at college?
