    "sinopse": "Yokodera is just like every teenage boy: perversion is in his nature. He can't help but look up girls' skirts and fantasize about them. However, in his case, every time he does something perverted, it somehow gets turned around and misunderstood as something positive for the community. Sick of being so perverted, he tries to shake free of it by going to a special part of town. On top of a hill, away from the town and at the foot of a large tree, there is a wooden sculpture of a beckoning cat that is said to have special powers. Instead of bringing a wish to the user like a typical beckoning cat, it takes something from the user, and, in Yokodera's case, his perversion. Still doubtful, he uses the beckoning cat thinking that it couldn't hurt to try, but, little does he know, his life is about to make a turn to the unexpected.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
