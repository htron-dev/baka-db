After meeting the sexually inexperienced Seo at a bar, he begins giving him sex lessons to kill time. This straight man was meant to be his to ravish, but things aren't going as expected? A young, earnest ikemen and a beautiful man, romantically hurt in the past, engage in sex lessons on Friday nights.\n\n(Source: Libre, translated)",
