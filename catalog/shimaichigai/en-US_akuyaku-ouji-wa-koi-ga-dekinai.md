## Sinopse

The manga is a romantic comedy starring the clever and handsome son of a wealthy family. In middle school he only ever studied, and everyone said he was plain like a background character. When he gets to high school, he enacts a plan to change his image to be more like a "main character" and get the perfect girlfriend.
