## Sinopse

Third year editor Takahiro Tsukamoto spends most of his time reading novels by Itsuki Setoguchi. Takahiro is in charge of Itsuki while his senior is on his maternity leave. However, what was supposed to be the best time has turned into something else due to his new neighbor. Their first impressions of each other were the worst, yet they also both find out that they are actually rivals in love! Under such circumstances, Takahiro couldn’t believe who appeared during his meeting with Setoguchi-sensei!
