## Sinopse

Shio is busy preparing for the school festival. In the morning, when he opens a door to wake Ririsu, his old friend, up as usual, she is still asleep. He tries to wake her up, but she gives him a strong kick.... On their way to school, Shio thinks, "Ririsu used to be pretty...." She is, however, now an egoistic girl.... One day, Ririsu suddenly introduces Chisa to Shio. "Will you please dance with me at the school festival...?" Shio is confused what to say while Ririsu shows mixed feelings...
