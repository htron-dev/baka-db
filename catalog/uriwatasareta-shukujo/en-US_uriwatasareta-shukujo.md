## Sinopse

Miss Aimée Peters desperately craves respectability. After her father scandalously auctions off her virginity, she escapes London to become a governess in remote Yorkshire. She's horrified to discover her new employer, the piratical Captain Corcoran, never sought a governess—he wants a bride!

Aimée's unadorned charm makes Captain Corcoran forget the true reason he married her. Then he discovers the fortune of coins stitched into Aimée's bodice... What secrets does his new wife hide behind her oh, so innocent facade?
