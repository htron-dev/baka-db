## Sinopse

Hinako lives in the countryside and is poor at speaking. She wants to improve her speech to be able to talk to people fluently, so she moves to Tokyo and plans to join the drama club in high school. When she arrives, however, it turns out her boarding house is a secondhand bookstore, and a beautiful girl who eats books lives there.
