## Sinopse

Going against their parents' strong wishes, Shuichi and Hime are able to marry because of a little lie: "I'm pregnant with Shu's baby!" Now, they have to make the lie... a reality?! Unfortunately, due to the fact they've been going at it like rabbits both day and night, Shuichi's depleted sperm count turns out to be problematic. Knock Me Up is a baby-making love comedy about leaving it in and letting it out! Michiyoshi Kuon presents a cute newlyweds manga about a tiny white lie that turns into a humorous-and quite pleasurable-race into parenthood. Complete with two super sexy bonus stories at the end, Knock Me Up is sure to knock you out!
