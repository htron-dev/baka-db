## Sinopse

1, 2) Taken Care of You
Chiaki is the new coach for the soccer team. Aiba, a star player, is doubtful that anyone as small as Chiaki can teach him anything. Aiba already cuts practice and doesn't listen to anyone. Chiaki's work is cut off for him, but he really wants to teach Aiba. But teach what is always a question.

3. Leave My Angel Alone
   Manabe Kensuke has been asked to take care of and protect his younger cousin, Kai, who is being stalked. As time goes on, the cousins are becoming good friends - very close. But is it too close? Is Kensuke any better than the stalker?
