## Sinopse

"Andou-kun, good morning ♪"

"Asakura-san, mornin'..."

(I got the seat next to the most beautiful girl in the school. A person who is willing to greet a loner like me, what a kind person she is. But in any case it's just lip service, she'll probably find me a bother if I start talking to her.)

"..."

"..."

(Even though I tried to greet him, why won't he talk to meee!! I can't talk about light novels to anyone besides Andou-kun, so please talk to meee!!)

This is that sort of school rom-com.
