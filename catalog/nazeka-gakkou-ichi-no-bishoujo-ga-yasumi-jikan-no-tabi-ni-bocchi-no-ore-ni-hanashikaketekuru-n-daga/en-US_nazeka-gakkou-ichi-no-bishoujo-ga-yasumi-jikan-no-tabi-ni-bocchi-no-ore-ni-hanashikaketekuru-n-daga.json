A person who is willing to greet a loner like me, what a kind person she is. But in any case it's just lip service, she'll probably find me a bother if I start talking to her.)\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n(Even though I tried to greet him, why won't he talk to meee!! I can't talk about light novels to anyone besides Andou-kun, so please talk to meee!!)\n\nThis is that sort of school rom-com.\n\n(Source: Kakuyomu, translated)",
