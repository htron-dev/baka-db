## Sinopse

Because of a past heartbreaking experience, Yuki closed off her heart. Not until her classmates dragged her and forced her to attend a group date with the guys from other school. There she met a crybaby Tsuyoshi. The next day, the next thing she knows is that she is being chased by Tsuyoshi saying that she wants her to listen to his depressing love story! But surrounded by the younger crybaby Tsuyoshi and hot classmate Keito, she can't remain uninvolved with love!
