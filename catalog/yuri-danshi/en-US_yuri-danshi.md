## Sinopse

Hanadera is a high school boy who loves yuri to the point he constantly watches his female classmates and just lets his imagination run wild. He's living the fabulous life of a man obsessed with yuri, but this is also source of personal conflict: if a yuri-filled world is so perfect, where does he fit in as a man?
