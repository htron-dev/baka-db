    "sinopse": "\"Did you know? Sex isn't just putting it in... You can feel good here as well.\" The root of white-collar worker Takanashi's stress is Akemi, his neighbor who brings girls home each night. He warns Akemi of his sleepless nights but is ignored, driving him up the wall! Takanashi snaps and proceeds to barge into Akemi's apartment... Even serious guys can be scary when they're mad! This is the love story of a closet gay and a straight guy with a naughty body!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
