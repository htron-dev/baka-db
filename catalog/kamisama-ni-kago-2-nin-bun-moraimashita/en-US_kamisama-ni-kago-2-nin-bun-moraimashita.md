## Sinopse

As he was being transferred to a different world with his classmates, Fubuki Amasaka was pushed out of the teleportation circle by his class bully, Yushin. When he woke up, he was alone and deep in a forest. However God, who had saw the entire thing and already warned them to stay in the circle, took Yushi's cheat skill away and gave it to Fubuki as punishment. Can Fubuki, who got two divine blessings, live in a different world safely?
