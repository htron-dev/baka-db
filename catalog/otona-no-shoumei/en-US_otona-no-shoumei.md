## Sinopse

Tsubaki always appears experienced, but actually, she has never had a boyfriend even though she’s already 16, and she’s a real baby. She wants to quickly increase her love experiences, and become an adult! One day, she got called out by her math teacher, Shiina-sensei, and she was told that she’ll have to take supplementary lessons. All alone in the math room with her teacher after school, Tsubaki’s heart beats like crazy when she sees that Shiina-sensei’s facial expressions are different from usual…?
