    "sinopse": "The main character is Dan-bi, the daughter of a Yakuza boss. One night, the father she loves more than anything is killed before her eyes. The killers blind her, making her father's death the last thing she sees with her own eyes. Her mother sends the wounded Dan-bi to Korea, where she has an eye transplant. From then on, Dan- bi is to be a good girl, live with her aunt, and stay out of trouble.\n\nDan-bi does her best, maneuvering between her aunt’s boy-crazy daughter and Jijang son. Things get complicated when her aunt's adopted son turns out to be connected to the mysterious boy who looked in on Dan-bi when she was in the hospital. This boy always looks so sad, and once he even asked for permission to kiss Dan-bi's eyes.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
