    "sinopse": "The Amusement Academy in Kyoto, along with its traditional curriculum, teaches its students about game design, how to write graphic novels, and voice animation. Akabane Iori is a cute girl that mistakenly enrolls into game design school instead of pursuing her dream of being a graphic novel author. She tries to make the best of her situation, but with no knowledge or experience about gaming, Iori has a hard time. The two friends she makes, Hio Raichi, a game programmer, and Kirino Sami take her deep down a niche otaku culture that may make forever change Iori.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
