    "sinopse": "The fancy and stylish playboy Xander Anaketos could have had his pick of any woman. Handsome, rich, and successful, he had it all, so Clare never understood why he chose a country bumpkin like her. For an entire year, they were intimate, traveling the globe together and basking in each other's presence. However, that dreamlike time came to an abrupt end when Xander broke off their relationship. Unbeknownst to him, Clare was pregnant with their child, but cast aside, she ran out without ever informing him.\n\nFour years later, Clare is a single mother working as a waitress to get by. One fateful day at the high-class restaurant where she works, she encounters Xander once again. After he tracks her down at home, he discovers Joey—his son—and insists he be part of his child's life from now on.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
