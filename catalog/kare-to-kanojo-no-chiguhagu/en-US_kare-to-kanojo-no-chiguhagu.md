## Sinopse

Koume, who has always admired the rumored "princess carry" is in her first year of high school. On her way to school, he meets a boy, Daisuke, who's extremely athletic, but extremely small. The only thing big is his attitude. Our first impressions suck! Plus, we're in the same volleyball club. I can't believe it's with Daisuke, or so I thought, but my heart won't stop thumping hard. What is this?
