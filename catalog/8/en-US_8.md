## Sinopse

Shibuya, Tokyo. An illegal skateboard race "13 Nights" is held once a year. 14-year-old Masato dies during the race. He was one of the last eight students at Udagawa Middle School. His former classmates couldn't cope with his death nor understand what lies behind it.

Then, all of a sudden, Eito appears, who looks just like Masato and tries everything to discover the truth behind Masato's death.
