    "sinopse": "Masumi is an earnest student with a past that made him hate adult men. However, due to some unprecedented circumstances, he got hired to work as a part-timer for a popular adult mangaka, Otomo. Although initially he was wary of being touched by Otomo, he starts to feel comfortable enough to even model in girl’s clothes. As if being restrained, his body starts to tremble in his gaze. His greed gradually propagates and wishes for Otomo to touch him more.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
