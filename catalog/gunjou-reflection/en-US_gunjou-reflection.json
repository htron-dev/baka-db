But one day she wants to \"take on a role that only she can fill\". With this determination in hand, she begins her heart-pounding school life.\n\nShe was then given the lead role for a mini play put on as a welcoming party for new students. This play had a special jinx to it: Anyone with a lead role in the play would become a huge star in the future! But she has to perform together with an unknown person, Serizawa Ren...!?\n\n(Source: MU)",
