## Sinopse

Koharu is a first year at Funakoshi Highschool for the Performing Arts. She is daunted by the fact that her class is filled with nothing but well-known stars. But one day she wants to "take on a role that only she can fill". With this determination in hand, she begins her heart-pounding school life.

She was then given the lead role for a mini play put on as a welcoming party for new students. This play had a special jinx to it: Anyone with a lead role in the play would become a huge star in the future! But she has to perform together with an unknown person, Serizawa Ren...!?
