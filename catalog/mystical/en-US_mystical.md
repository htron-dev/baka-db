## Sinopse

Garam has always loved to draw, but his dreams of being an artist have been on hold ever since his mother passed away. Wanting to become more independent and focus on his art, he moves into his grandmother's empty house by the ocean. There, he meets his greatest muse: a mystical water creature with no memories of her past. Now it's up to Garam to help her uncover what she has forgotten.
