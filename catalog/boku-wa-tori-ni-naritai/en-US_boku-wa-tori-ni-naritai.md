## Sinopse

Contains four stories: a boy's escape from reform school; an aspiring mangaka's final bid (one of the brothers of piano boy makes a not insubstantial appearance here); a tiny alien family crashes accidentally into Earth and into the lives of two human families; finally, the eponymous story of a guy's mysterious, quiet classmate who turns out to be a modern day Icarus.
