    "sinopse": "It has been 800 years since the battle gods \"Idaten\", who boast overwhelming speed and strength, contained the \"demons\" who led the world to ruin after a fierce battle. \"That battle\" is now just an old tale in a distant myth. While the \"peaceful generation of the gods,\" who have never fought since they were born, are out of peace, someone has revived the demons from a long sleep! Bring armed forces, wisdom, politics, conspiracy, whatever you can use! No-rule & no-limit three-way battle royale is about to begin!!!\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
