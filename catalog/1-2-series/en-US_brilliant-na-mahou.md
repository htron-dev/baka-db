## Sinopse

Mitsuki's a high school freshman worried about her looks—or, at least, her "baby face." Until, that is, she enlists a little help from classmate Atsuki and her makeup kit. When Atsuki's finished, the transformation is complete—and breathtaking. It's also when the romantic adventures begin—a roller coaster ride of the heart that young and old are sure to enjoy.
