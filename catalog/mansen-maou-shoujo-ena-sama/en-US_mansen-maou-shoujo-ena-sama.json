    "sinopse": "In the land of Glengard, the realm's 666th Demon King, Fienalia Glengard Flamveil...is bored. With no challenges to excite her and all of humanity long since subjugated, she's off to find a new world—any world!—to conquer...and it just so happens that Earth is next on the hit list! But when \"Ena-sama\" meets Kento Sugitani, an aspiring manga artist, it seems she might have found a new hobby more interesting than world domination. What is a demon lord to do but enroll in a manga school herself?!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
