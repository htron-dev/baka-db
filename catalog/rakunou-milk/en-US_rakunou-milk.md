## Sinopse

A four-panel comic set on the farm by Yoko Sanri of B Gata H Kei. Laughter, it does a body good (?).

When she was very young, Milk Ushijima saw a calf being born on television and was greatly moved. Now she's enrolled in Toto School of Veterinary Medicine, and she thought her campus life was going to begin, but unfortunately... it turns out she's a complete airhead! She's about to get caught up in the lives of the crazy characters that are her teachers and fellow students, and her journey's about to go wild!
