## Sinopse

Jinguuji, who's not coming to school, is the most "talented" in his grade. To get this son of a yakuza to attend lessons, Yuuki, the assistant teacher in charge visits him at home. But when Yuuki gets the attention of Jinguuji, who is with a girl, the latter suddenly gets aroused and forces Yuuki to sleep with him. Is there a "family secret" Yuuki's not allowed to know hidden in the ferocious eyes of Jinguuji who's devouring Yuuki's body?
