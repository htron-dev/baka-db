## Sinopse

In a world where demons are subjugated by human "trainers," there is a demon named Bahomust that none of the trainers can handle. Dia, a trainer who breaks demons by pleasuring them with magic, is sent in to handle the high-level demon, but the tables quickly turn as Bahomust escapes his restraints.
