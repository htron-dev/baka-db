## Sinopse

Zenichirou is a middle school student raised in a motherless family. His breakfast always consists of onigiri and instant miso soup from the convenience store.

Yae, a childhood friend of Zenichirou, cannot stand to see him eat such an innutritious breakfast, so she decides to make him breakfast every morning…

This story conveys a simple message: eating with another person makes miso soup taste more delicious and hearty!
