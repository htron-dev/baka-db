## Sinopse

There is only one Magi Craft Meister in the world. After the death of the last Meister over one thousand years ago, Jin Nidou was transported to another world in order to succeed her will. After obtaining the knowledge of the Magi Craft Meister, Jin attempts to use a warp gate but it malfunctions, transporting him to an unknown world. Along with that, an automata he recently restored also uses the warp gate in order to search for her "father." Thus, the crafting journey of the new Magi Craft Meister begins!
