Theo has travelled to a bar for Rumspringa, a traditional coming-of-age period for members of the Amish community where the adolescent leaves the enclosed religious community to take part in the outside world. There, Theo meets Oz, a man working as a waiter after abandoning his dream to be a Broadway performer.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
