## Sinopse

The story of an Amish boy named Theo living in America in the 1980s. Theo has travelled to a bar for Rumspringa, a traditional coming-of-age period for members of the Amish community where the adolescent leaves the enclosed religious community to take part in the outside world. There, Theo meets Oz, a man working as a waiter after abandoning his dream to be a Broadway performer.
