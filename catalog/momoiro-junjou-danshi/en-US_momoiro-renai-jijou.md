## Sinopse

Somehow, over the summer, Yamaguchi ended up going out with his best friend, Takagari. But now that they are together, something has really been bothering Yamaguchi; why does Takagari love him so much? Is it his shaggy hair that begs to be petted? His often stubborn personality? Or the way he blushes when lavished with Takagari's umm... affection?!? Either way, Yamaguchi's insecurities are really putting a strain on their relationship. Seems like he is pretty nervous about fulfilling Takagari's more carnal needs when is mind is pre-occupied with other things. While Takagari would like for nothing more than to drag Yamaguchi to the nearest cupboard and have his way with him, it seems like our seme is going to need a little bit of help to calm his nervous, little uke.
