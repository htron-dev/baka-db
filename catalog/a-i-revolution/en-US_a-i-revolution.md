## Sinopse

In futuristic Japan, robots are as common as toasters or washing machines. Technology rules, and high-school student Sui is more than used to any new inventions that may come about…until her father engineers a robot that walks, talks and looks as human as she does! Now it’s Sui’s job to teach her new friend about being human, and she couldn’t be happier. But teaching a robot to fit into society isn’t as easy as she thinks, and the fabulous new prototype may wind up being more trouble than she expected…
