    "sinopse": "It's August 15th, the season of the Bon Festival. Aki likes this time of year because she can see the spirits of everyone's ancestors that come back home, and wishes that it could stay like this forever. However, her wish comes true as the same day begins to repeat over and over. She works together with a mysterious young man named Natsuo, the only other person in town who notices the days repeating, in order to find out what's going on, and how to return things back to normal.\n\n(Source: Leed Publishing, translated)",
