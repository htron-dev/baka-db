## Sinopse

Watanabe gathered up Mizuo's battered and bloodstained body, was forced to cooperate with the ensuing blood transfusion, and for his trouble was late for his part-time job, resulting in his termination. The mysterious Mizuo tells the now-unemployed Watanabe that he is a vampire, and offers Watanabe a position at his salon. Despite his feeling that Mizuo is a potentially dangerous partner, for some reason Watanabe cannot bear to be away from him... Includes a bonus back-up story!
