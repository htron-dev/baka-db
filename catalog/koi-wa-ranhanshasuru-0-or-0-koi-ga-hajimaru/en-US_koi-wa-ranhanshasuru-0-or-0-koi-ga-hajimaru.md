## Sinopse

Cold beauty uke is member of the calligraphy club in university, and is always taken advantage of by the other members, by pushing all the tasks on him. He's in love with playboy seme, who's in the same year as uke. Due to jealousy and other circumstances, seme forces uke in a sexual relationship. It escalates into an uke-breakdown, and they return to being just friends, as opposed to sex-friends. The story is about their awkwardness, and how it takes courage to show your true feelings.
