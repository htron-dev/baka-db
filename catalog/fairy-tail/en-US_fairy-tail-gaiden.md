## Sinopse

Fairy Tail Gaiden is a trilogy detailing the adventures of Sting and Rogue, Gajeel and Levy, and Laxus and the Thunder Tribe in separate volumes.

Kengami no Souryuu
Now the guild master of Sabertooth, Sting faces the trials of leading a guild and the responsibilities that come with it. A number of challenges come his and Rogue's way, including the kidnapping of one of their guild members and a mage attempting to steal their dragon slayer powers. They must fight to keep their Sabertooth guild family together.

Road Knight
Mash, a nefarious criminal, manages to break out of a secure prison, and Gajeel is suspected as his accomplice! Furthermore, Gajeel has been missing from the guild for three whole days. Determined to get an explanation for his alleged actions, Levy sets out on a quest to find him. Little does she know that the reasons for his absence lie deep in his past, and are connected to a malicious plot conceived by Gajeel's "friend."

Raigo Issen
Following the disbandment of Fairy Tail, Laxus and the Thunder Tribe turn up at the door of Blue Pegasus, seeking to join the guild. Even though they are accepted, the environment is different from Fairy Tail: not only is it a guild, but also a host club. Before they can settle in, Ichiya is kidnapped by the rival guild Red Princess! Laxus and the Thunder Tribe set out to rescue Ichiya from the clutches of a fellow eccentric guild.
