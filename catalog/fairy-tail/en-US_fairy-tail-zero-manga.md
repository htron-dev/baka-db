## Sinopse

Long before she would found Fairy Tail, first master Mavis Vermillion is left under the care of the Red Lizard guild. Abused and belittled at every opportunity, she is forced to complete difficult chores. Despite this horrific treatment, Mavis refuses to cry, for if she did, she would not be able to meet the fairies. However, her life of servitude comes to an abrupt end when the Blue Skull guild raids her home, leaving only Mavis and the guild master's daughter Zera alive.

For many years, Mavis and Zera live alone, taking care of each other. But this all changes when a band of treasure hunters come to the island in search of the Tenrou Jade—a precious gem that is sacred to the island. With the arrival of new faces, her life begins to change again. Mavis has never stopped wishing to meet the fairies, and now she may finally have the chance to find them.
