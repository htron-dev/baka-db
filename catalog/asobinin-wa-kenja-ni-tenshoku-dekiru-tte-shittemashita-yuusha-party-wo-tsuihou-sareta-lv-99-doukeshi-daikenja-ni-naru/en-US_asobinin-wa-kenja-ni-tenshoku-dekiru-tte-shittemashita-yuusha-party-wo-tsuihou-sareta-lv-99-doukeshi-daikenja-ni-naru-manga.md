## Sinopse

The Jester—more commonly known as the "Playboy" Dylan, was fired from the party of the heroes. The self-centered heroes didn't understand Dylan's importance to the group. They were just a group of one-man teams; not interested in cooperation at all. Any failures were blamed on the jester. Dylan, who was disgusted with such companions and was sick of playing as their comedic foil, happily accepted being kicked out.

The heroes didn't know. After saving them many times over with his magic tricks, the level 99 jester can change his job title to that of a Great Sage.

"Life, how about a rewrite?"

He's done being the clown. From here on out, he's going to take the leading role.
