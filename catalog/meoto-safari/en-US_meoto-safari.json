    "sinopse": "Jo is your average manga artist slash divorcee, a dime a dozen in Japan. At least that's what he'd like the outside world to believe. But his editor Nichika knows his terrible secret, a secret which she threatens to expose unless he puts a ring on her finger.\n\nWhat is Jo to do when he is still deeply traumatized by a past divorce? Why, marry her of course! After all, don't people say to \"Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer?\"\n\n(Source: Stiletto Heels)",
