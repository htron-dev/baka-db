    "sinopse": "Story centers on twin sisters Miyako and Tomiko Shigeta, who work as real estate agents in the Kichijouji neighborhood in Tokyo, an area that is consistently ranked #1 as the place where those already living in Tokyo want to live. The sisters assist women searching for an apartment, but direct them to neighborhoods in Tokyo aside from Kichijouji. The story follows the worries of new clients as they move, and showcases the charm of Tokyo neighborhoods.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
