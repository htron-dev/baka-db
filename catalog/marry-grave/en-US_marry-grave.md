## Sinopse

In a world where demons run amok on earth, Riseman Sawyer had managed to find love and happiness with his wife, Rosalie. But she died, and Riseman now carries her coffin on his back while searching for the ingredients to the "Deadman's Recipe." The spell is rumored to be able to bring someone back to life—a rumor that Riseman knows is true, because Rosalie used it on him, making him an immortal "undead" at the price of her life.

Gathering all the spell's ingredients won't be easy, and the world is still full of plenty of despair and death. Can hope and love possibly be resurrected?
