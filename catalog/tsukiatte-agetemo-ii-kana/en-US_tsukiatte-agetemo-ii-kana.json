    "sinopse": "For as long as she’s known, Miwa's been into women, and now she's at university, it might finally be time for her to come out of her straight-passing shell. Of course, that takes a lot of confidence, and coming out is never easy. But could Saeko, her trashy popular weirdo of a friend, give her the help she needs. Or just maybe, could the two of them be more alike than Miwa realises...?!\n\n(Source: Sexy Akiba Detectives)",
