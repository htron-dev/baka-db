## Sinopse

"There's no way you can run away from me-- I MUST HAVE YOU!" said the super-egotistic ex-host Hisakawa as he carried a bouquet of roses, to the beautiful yet uptight sensei, Shindo Misaki!!

Under the masterful fingers of his pursuer, Misaki was assaulted by a powerful lust, which rendered him defenseless to Hisakawa's advances. Though in truth, it was Misaki's unconscious wanton responses that captured Hisakawa's heart!
