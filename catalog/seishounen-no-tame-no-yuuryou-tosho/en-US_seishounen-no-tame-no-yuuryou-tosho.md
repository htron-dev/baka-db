## Sinopse

Shun Imai is a shy, quiet boy who struggles with the idea that he may be gay. One day, he is found reading a BL novel by his classmate Kounosu, who calls him out on it. Although Imai is surprised and anxious, Kounosu says "I want to know more about you"... This starts a tender relationship that takes place over time, pulling at your heart strings.
