In the case of Koutarou Sasaki, middle-aged widower consumed by his extreme worry for his teenage daughter Noriko, the answer is a lot. Noriko herself is only trying to live a normal high school life together with her boyfriend Kitano—a seemingly impossible task in the face of the increasingly bizarre incidents and situations her father's antics cause, all in the name of keeping his daughter off the delinquent path!\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 6: Kojin Kyouju",
