    "sinopse": "The first story under the title \"Chibi Maruko-chan\" was published in the August 1986 edition of the shoujo manga magazine Ribon. Other semi-autobiographical stories by the author had appeared in Ribon and Ribon Original in 1984 and 1985, and were included in the first \"Chibi Maruko-chan\" tankōbon in 1987. The author first began writing and submitting strips in her final year of senior high school, although Shueisha (the publisher of Ribon and Ribon Original) did not decide to run them until over a year later. The author's intent was to write \"essays in manga form.\" Many stories are inspired by incidents from the author's own life, and some characters are based on her family and friends. The nostalgic, honest and thoughtful tone of the strip led to its becoming popular among a wider audience.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
