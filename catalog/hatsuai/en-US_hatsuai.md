## Sinopse

Why would Kashiwaya be so bothered by Hibino’s adam’s apple? Kashiwaya couldn’t figure out the reason and thought maybe he might be a vampire. After pushing Hibino down and started licking at his throat, Kashiwaya felt so good that he didn’t want to stop. What is going on? The pure and innocent love story of a unique high-schooler, Kashiwaya, and his classmate, Hibino.
