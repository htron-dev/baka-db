## Sinopse

Haru Miyoshi, a researcher who loves his "alone time," agrees to a blind date just before his 30th birthday. However, his date's younger brother, Kei Akiyoshi, is there to greet him instead. Knowing that his sister stood Haru up, Kei is nice enough to join him for a few drinks. Comforted by Kei's kindness, a drunken Haru admits he's tormented by the urban legend that says "men who don't do it by their 30th birthday become wizards," when Kei leans in and steals his first kiss...!
