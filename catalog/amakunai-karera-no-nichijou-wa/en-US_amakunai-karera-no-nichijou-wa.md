## Sinopse

Midori drops her wallet on her first day of high school, but her new classmate Ichijo swoops in to help. She wants to thank him, but he's part of a tight-knit trio and none of them are ever in class! Rumor has it that they all got expelled for acting up, and studious Midori's actually at risk of expulsion, too... In order to help support her family, she has a part-time job, which is against the school rules. When the chairman of the school board catches her leaving work, he says he'll let it go—but only if she's up to the task of bringing the three boys back to school. Well, why not? It'll be a piece of cake... right?
