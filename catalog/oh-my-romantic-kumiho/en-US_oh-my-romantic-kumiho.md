## Sinopse

Ji-Eun has been dating Gyuho for 3 years now and he's pretty much the perfect boyfriend. Even the way they meet was perfect, the same as in her favorite movie, Twilight. But now she learns that he is a Kumiho (Nine Tailed Fox), he's 700 years old and he wants to marry her. And on top of all this weird things he mentions that he loves her liver. Is the price of a perfect boyfriend worth her liver? Join in this funny contemporary fantasy where a girl learns that prince charming also has a dark side and that stories sound good in a book, but living them might end up not so enjoyable.
