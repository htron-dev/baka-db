## Sinopse

The daughter of a prominent family. That was all that her mother valued in Abigail's existence. Raised like a caged bird, there was one time that she disobeyed her mother. That was when she fell in love with a poor boy, Grant, eight years ago and got pregnant. But the summer love ended in atrocity with his betrayal. Since, she has lived her life like a doll, but one day, she is offered a marriage proposal by a man who is connected to her mother. While considering it, Grant shows up after eight years! But hatred toward her spirals in his heart...
