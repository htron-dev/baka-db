## Sinopse

The Konoe and Kazuki families have been fighting like cats and dogs for generations. Masaya Konoe and Yuma Kazuki attend the same elite high school and are known to all as arch rivals, but do they really hate each other? Masaya still cherishes a childhood memory of a time when Yuma shared a "treasure" with him. Now they share a secret attraction. Can they hide their passion? Burning desire has a way of erupting into flames! (_back of book_)
