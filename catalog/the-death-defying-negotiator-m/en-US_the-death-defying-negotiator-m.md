## Sinopse

Jiro gambles at mahjong, but loses big. His opponent, however want him as a partner and takes Jiro to a factory where the Uehara yakuza group are gambling about something more than money - a man's life. No matter if he wins or loses, somebody has to die. The game quickly turns into a violence story about life and death. Together with Takeda, whom he had managed to save from said game, they try to take down the Uehara group once and for all. And the yakuza - they have their matters to settle.
