## Sinopse

Liz who remembers being dumped by her lover in her previous life decides to live freely in her current one.

Holding a mysterious power, she was invited to the palace as a saint candidate where she meets with the crown prince who was actually her former lover from her previous life.

Though Liz looks to be the weakest among the saint candidates she is (likely) the strongest among them.
