    "sinopse": "Six lost souls gather in a candle-lit room with a mysterious host. None of them know exactly how they came to be there, but there's only one way out. Each of us follows a path preordained by destiny. If the souls are judged to have lost their path by mistake they will be returned to it. But if destiny says their time is up: they have to move on.
