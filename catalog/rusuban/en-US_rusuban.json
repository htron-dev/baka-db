    "sinopse": "A Handmade Animated Cat! Stop and Look at Me for just 4 minutes! It's the first time for the Cat to be all by itself at home. This Cat does not have a name yet and nobody knows whether it is female or male. And it has two faces, one is very sensitive and the other is rather naughty. We try to make sensitive animations, and do not want to bombard children with too much noise and too many images.\n\n(Source: N&G Production)",
