## Sinopse

Asuka is a talented woman who works hard at her real estate job, but her true dream is to get married and be a loving housewife. She seems to be on the fast track to realizing that dream... until her boyfriend of five years suddenly asks to break up. She meets Nanami Ryuu, a young hotshot TV announcer, who is accomplished, handsome, and acts the perfect gentleman, but he is strongly opposed to marriage. Is it possible to get along without agreeing on such an important issue?
