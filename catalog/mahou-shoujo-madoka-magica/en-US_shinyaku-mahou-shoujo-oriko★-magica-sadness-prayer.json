The story is split into two distinct parts: the first exploring Oriko's new friend Komaki Asako, another magical girl; how Oriko met Kirika; Oriko's family; Komaki's friends, and her death by Kirika's hands. The second part features the reappearance of Sasa Yuuki and the introduction of many more magical girls.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
