    "sinopse": "The last thing Sooha wants in her life is a man. She's sick of her mother calling about boyfriend problems, of friends trying to set her up on dates, of girls waiting for their Prince Charming. But when a broke and homeless man offers to keep house in exchange for temporary housing, Sooha finds herself saying yes to a man for the first time in her life. After all, who wouldn’t want to come home to warm homemade dinners, clean sheets, and freshly ironed clothes?\n\n(Source: Lezhin Comics)",
