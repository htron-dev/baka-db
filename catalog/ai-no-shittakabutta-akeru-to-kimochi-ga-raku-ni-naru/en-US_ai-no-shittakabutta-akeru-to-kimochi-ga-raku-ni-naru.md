## Sinopse

This is a story about the Over-thinking pig with his frustrations with love, his suffering, and how he eventually tries to cheer up. Of course, while we watch and laugh at his bitter experience, we simultaneously recognize his circumstance in our own troubled relationships. Only when we can understand how feelings change when in love will we find true happiness.
