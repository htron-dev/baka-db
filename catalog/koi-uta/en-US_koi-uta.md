## Sinopse

A collection of fantasy oneshots with a dash of animal-ear flavor. An onnagata inspires a young boy to get in touch with his inner woman, a family of foxes teach a miserable young tailor to cure leather, a cat is trapped in a pretty intense love triangle, a bumbling newspaper club member is delegated to photography club duties, a boy with a history of sexual abuse falls for the painter he wants to cover those memories up, and a merboy falls for the wrong man.
