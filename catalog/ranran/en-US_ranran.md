## Sinopse

Azuki and Chimaki are fraternal twins with supernatural powers! Azuki has the ability to read the minds of anyone she touches, and Chimaki has the ability to fly at will by taking off her hat. Because of their special abilities, they have to be homeschooled, and the only friend they have is their cousin, Aruhei. That all changes one day when a boy named Kohaku moves into their neighborhood. Will they be able to become friends with him? Only time will tell!
