## Sinopse

Georgette "Georgie" became the talk of every social circle when she married the Greek tycoon Angolos Constantine. She loved him so much that she put up with his mother and sister, who demeaned her, and the servants, who ignored her. None of that mattered as long as she had his love—and his child. But when Georgie told Angolos that she was pregnant, he threw her out, insisting the child was not his. Georgie's whirlwind romance ended in a flash and, unable to handle the resulting gossip, she moved to the countryside to live with her grandmother.

This experience allows Georgie to grow and become an independent woman who enjoys her teaching career and time spent with her beloved son Nicky, who is the spitting image of his father. When Angolos reappears one day, he wants to be part of their lives. While there is no doubt he can be a good father, can Angolos and Georgie become close once again?
