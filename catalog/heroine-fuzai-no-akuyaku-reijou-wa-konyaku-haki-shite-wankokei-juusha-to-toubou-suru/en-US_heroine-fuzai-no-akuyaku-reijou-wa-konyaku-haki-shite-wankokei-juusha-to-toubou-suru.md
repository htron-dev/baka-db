## Sinopse

When I was reincarnated, I was a villainess, Viara.

"Why am I a villainess? I definitely don't want to die!"

Viara is in love with her servant Sid who has supported her for a long time. While trying to find the heroine and set up another fiancé, Viara, who couldn't stand the tyrant prince, finally hit the prince and fled the country.
