## Sinopse

Immediately after graduating from Tootsuki Culinary Academy as the First Seat of the Elite Ten, Kojirou Shinomiya moved to France to work towards becoming the first Japanese chef to win the French Pluspol Award. However, it was achieving his dreams that made his cooking stagnate; with no goal to fight for at the top of the food chain, he soon lost the drive to improve his cooking.

Shokugeki no Souma: L'étoile focuses on Kojirou's self-reinvention following the aftermath of the unofficial Shokugeki at the first years' training camp. To revitalize his passion for the culinary arts, Kojirou must re-examine his old methods, and in turn, move toward the future to find out what he wants to express with his cooking.
