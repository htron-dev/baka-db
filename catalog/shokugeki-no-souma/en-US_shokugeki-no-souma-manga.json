    "sinopse": "Fifteen-year-old Souma Yukihira dreams to one day surpass his father's cooking skills and take over as the chef of their small family diner. However, his aspirations come to a halt when his father announces the closure of their restaurant, as he must travel abroad for cooking-related business.\n\nIn the meantime, Souma is urged by his father to attend Tootsuki Culinary Academy: a world-renowned school where expulsions of incompetent students are commonplace. Due to the curriculum's rigor, any student that manages to graduate is recognized as a chef of great caliber. Reluctantly agreeing to the proposition, Souma heads to Tootsuki's high school division for the entrance exam. Little does he know, he will soon begin a new chapter of his life—one that entails new friends, daring rivalries, and sleepless nights.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
