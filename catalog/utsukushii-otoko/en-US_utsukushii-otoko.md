## Sinopse

Welcome to the future. In tried-and-true sci-fi fashion, the date is given in a time system that we have no reference for, so I can't tell you how far into the future we are beyond saying that it is S.E. 156. Thirty years before our story begins, an ace space pilot by the name of M2 Rimstein was put into an experimental cold sleep until such time as he would be needed.

That time is now. He is unfrozen and put in command of the Dance Mania unit of three superb pilots, though two are rookies: Stellasta von Argyll, Malloy Chihaya, and Cloud Neelsen. Accelerated training commences, and new ships and gadgets are brought out so that they will have victory over their enemy.

Unfortunately, things go awry fairly soon when M2 is captured and brain-washed by a planet which sends him out to fight for the enemy. Malloy at first refuses to fight his commander, and then does so with the conviction that he can bring him home to the Great Carrier.

Bringing him home may be easy, but regaining his mind?
