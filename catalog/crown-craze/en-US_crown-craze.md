In a room lie the two real brothers, the 17-year-old Kuruto and the 15 year old Enishi. —This is the good night kiss— They have been together since they were small. It was a natural thing for them to spend time together but that is slowly starting to change.

The day the relationship between the two of them becomes awkward is when Kuruto returns home after a long time. The brothers attitude towards each other are so different and suddenly Kuruto tells the younger brother “Don’t think of saying you love me again”…?
