While their relationship has not been without its challenges, they've managed to get past them and live happily together... But they're not actually \"living together,\" unlike their friends Yoshimura and Shima, who shacked up halfway through their college life. Will their friends' decision inspire Morisaki and Taguchi to start thinking about their future?\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
