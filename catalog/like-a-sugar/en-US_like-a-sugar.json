    "sinopse": "One day, Yoshimura bumps into Shima, the terrifying third-year with scary eyes and even scarier rumors surrounding him. Thinking that Shima's angry, Yoshimura begs for mercy, not knowing that Shima's just...a sweet tooth? Hobby baker Yoshimura ends up sharing homemade sweets with Shima every day, realizing the famed bad boy isn't that bad at all. All is well until one day when Yoshimura's teaching Shima how to bake, he somehow accidentally sneaks in a kiss...? A sweet high school love story between a puppy-like boy and his scarily frank underclassman!\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
