## Sinopse

Present day, present time. For some reason, rare newborns get swapped with the newborns from another world. They have the features of legendary creatures (like dwarves, oni, harpies etc), however, they lack the abilities of their legendary predecessors. Our heroine, an elf girl Kazamori suffered through her childhood because other kids expected her to wield magic like a true elf. She tries to uphold her "magic user" image in high school but the person who finds out her secret is an ordinary human who practices magic-like science.
