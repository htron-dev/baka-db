    "sinopse": "Seishuu Handa is considered a prodigy in the calligraphy world. However, he is extremely narcissistic about his work, and when a senior curator dismisses his award-winning piece as conventional and bland, he loses his cool, leading to potentially career-ending repercussions.\n\nAfter seeing his son's immaturity, his father⁠—also a master calligrapher—sends Handa to a village in the Goto Islands as punishment. Deprived of city comforts, Handa moves into a house in the local village with the sole intention of spending his stay engrossed in calligraphy. However, the house he has moved into was previously the hideout for some rambunctious children, headed by Naru Kotoishi, who are unwilling to move out. Furthermore, the neighbors seem very interested in the calligrapher, who they see as an amusing oddity!\n\nDespite Handa having been uprooted from his comfortable lifestyle, his experiences with the village and its people will teach him things about himself, life, and calligraphy.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
