## Sinopse

In his middle school years, the feminine-looking Terumi Minamoto was bullied by his female classmates after the most popular boy in the class declared Terumi to be the prettiest "girl" of them all. Living with a fear of women ever since, he seeks to change himself as he enters college. However, his father puts a wrench in his plans when he brings a pregnant woman home, announcing her to be Terumi's new mother. To accommodate her in their small apartment, Terumi is sent to live with his aunt, who is coincidentally an associate professor at his new college.

On his first day, Terumi finds out that his aunt, Kaoruko Fujiwara, is a voluptuous beauty known to hate men. As a professor, her main research is on the classic work The Tale of Genji. After a more personal introduction, Kaoruko works out that Terumi has suffered greatly because of his looks. Sensing an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of her research, she offers to help him—starting with his fear of women. But when her methods include being "raised" into the perfect lover like Genji who had sex with 14 women, will he truly be cured by the end of his very own "Tale of Minamoto"?
