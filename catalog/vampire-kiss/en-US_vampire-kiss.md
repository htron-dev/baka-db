## Sinopse

Takara meets Aoyama, a guy in her class who is really cute and a great athlete. Deciding she likes him on the spot, Takara asks him out on a date! However, despite her cuteness and popularity, she is turned down! Things get interesting as Takara finds Aoyama asleep one day with his neck left exposed wide open there, just ready for a little nibble... Another problem Takara must face is a classmate who suspects her secret.

The second story involves the appearance of a new boy in Takara's life who knows her secret and has one of his own!

The third story is a too-cute-to-be-believed flashback story where everyone is a little kid.
