However, despite her cuteness and popularity, she is turned down! Things get interesting as Takara finds Aoyama asleep one day with his neck left exposed wide open there, just ready for a little nibble... Another problem Takara must face is a classmate who suspects her secret.\n\nThe second story involves the appearance of a new boy in Takara's life who knows her secret and has one of his own!\n\nThe third story is a too-cute-to-be-believed flashback story where everyone is a little kid.\n\n(Source: shoujo-manga.com)",
