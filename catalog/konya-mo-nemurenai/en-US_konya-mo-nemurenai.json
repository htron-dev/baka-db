    "sinopse": "An amusing romantic story about a college student girl and a man who is a famous fashion designer. Thanks to the antics of his very unique cat, the girl and the designer are thrown together, and sparks fly! Again, there is a large age difference between the hero and heroine. His name is Hanada Renichi, and he is 38 years old. Her name is Saigou Kaori, and she is only 18. Their age difference is an issue in there relationship. He is interested in her, but tries to resist because he thinks he is too old, and she is a virgin. But even though Kaori likes to tease him by caling him 'ojisan' ('gramps') she doesn't care about his age, and is perfectly willing to let him relieve her of the second objection he has about her. This is a very cute romantic comedy!",
