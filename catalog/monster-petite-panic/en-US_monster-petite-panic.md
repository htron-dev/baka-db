## Sinopse

Suzuki Kojirou, whose Kago is Ifrit, is a member of the public morals committee at a high school which gathers a lot of students whose “Kago” powers are stronger than normal people. But, for some reason, he’s being pestered everyday by the super beautiful president of the public morals committee, Asagiri Lauri—whose Kago is Leviathan—who always has to run around solving all kinds of problems within the school because of his strong power.
