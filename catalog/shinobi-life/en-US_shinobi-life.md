## Sinopse

Have you ever wanted your own personal Ninja? That is not a question that our heroine Beni Fujiwara has ever pondered, but she is about to find out what it is like! Many, many years ago, a ninja named Kagetora devoted his life to protecting Princess Beni ("Beni-Hime"). Unfortunately they are attacked, and Kagetora is flung into a lake, where he sinks to the bottom.

Beni is a modern high school girl, but her life is not quite normal. The story begins with her being threatened at knife-point. Not only that, but she is standing on the edge of the roof of a skyscraper. A struggle ensues, but things go from bad to worse when a mysterious boy appears out of thin air and lands on Beni, knocking her off the edge!

You guessed it—it's Kagetora. There was a time portal in the middle of that lake, and he has slipped forward in time to modern Japan. I suppose that if you are knocked off the edge of a skyscraper, it's good to have a ninja around, because, Kagetora is able to use some of his super ninja skills to save Beni from becoming a pavement pancake. When Kagetora lays eyes on Beni, he is convinced she is his "Beni-Hime-Sama" and swears to be her protector.
