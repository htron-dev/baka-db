    "sinopse": "Have you ever wanted your own personal Ninja? That is not a question that our heroine Beni Fujiwara has ever pondered, but she is about to find out what it is like! Many, many years ago, a ninja named Kagetora devoted his life to protecting Princess Beni (\"Beni-Hime\"). Unfortunately they are attacked, and Kagetora is flung into a lake, where he sinks to the bottom.\n\nBeni is a modern high school girl, but her life is not quite normal. The story begins with her being threatened at knife-point. Not only that, but she is standing on the edge of the roof of a skyscraper. A struggle ensues, but things go from bad to worse when a mysterious boy appears out of thin air and lands on Beni, knocking her off the edge!\n\nYou guessed it—it's Kagetora. There was a time portal in the middle of that lake, and he has slipped forward in time to modern Japan. I suppose that if you are knocked off the edge of a skyscraper, it's good to have a ninja around, because, Kagetora is able to use some of his super ninja skills to save Beni from becoming a pavement pancake. When Kagetora lays eyes on Beni, he is convinced she is his \"Beni-Hime-Sama\" and swears to be her protector.\n\n(Source: Emily's Random Shoujo Manga)",
