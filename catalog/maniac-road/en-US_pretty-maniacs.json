    "sinopse": "The final volume of Maniac Road has come and gone, but author Kurihashi delves deeper into the otaku crazed world of fandom with \"Pretty Maniacs\". Hoping to further the manga/anime craze, Takezou sets up a sister shop in the U.S. He leaves his sister to help at the Maniac Road store. Bitten hard by the otaku bug, Takezou's sis quickly enlists the aid of some quirky but talanted anime-philes. Watch as this new zany bunch of cute otaku girls match wits with other fans in this humorous and off beat romp through the world of Japanese fandom.\n\n(Source: DrMaster)",
