## Sinopse

A stop-motion comedy drama about sugar cube people from the Meiji era. Specifically it focuses on the father Kakuza who easily succumbs to emotion usually about his 37 year old daughter Touko's newest fiancé who tries to ask for his blessing. He's scared of losing his daughter even though it was his late wife's dying wish to see her as a happy bride.

The show had a very irregular release schedule and by the end of its serialization its title had changed to Kakugen! Kakuza Tousan.
