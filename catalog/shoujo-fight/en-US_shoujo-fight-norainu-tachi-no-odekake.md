## Sinopse

The story follows Neri Ooishi, a high school girl who is a talented volleyball player. She once was the captain of an elementary school team that went all the way to the national tournament. However, she spent three years as an alternate at a junior high school renowned for its volleyball program. Now she is in high school with new teammates, and she gets a chance to prove herself again.

The sixth manga volume will have a "special edition" that will ship with the anime DVD on October 23. Nihonbashi herself is writing the script for the anime, and Prodution I.G is animating it.
