## Sinopse

Yuuto Lenix, a former DEA investigator was arrested by a false accusation of killing his own partner. The FBI agents gave him a special deal, to look for a particular criminal hiding in the same prison. By the time he was detained in the Schelger Prison, he got to meet his cellmate, Dick Burnford, who didn't show signs of being kind and welcoming upon his arrival. Will he ever be in good terms with his inmates, especially to Dick?
