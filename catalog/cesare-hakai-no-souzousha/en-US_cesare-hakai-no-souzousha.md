## Sinopse

Based on exhaustive research in collaboration with a Dante scholar, Souryo brings Cesare Borgia, one of the most enigmatic figures in history, to life in vivid detail. Bookish and naive, Angelo da Canossa is unprepared for life as a student in a university that hums with tension and intrigue in Renaissance Italy. Will his innocence remain intact when a chance encounter with the charismatic Cesare draws him ever deeper into the darker side of the Renaissance?
