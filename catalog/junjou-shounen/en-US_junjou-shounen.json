    "sinopse": "Kusaka Taisei was born into a good family without knowing much about the world. He became interested in the reserved and tranquil beauty of the transfer student, Mizutani Aoi. On a day off from school, Kusaka spotted Mizutani going somewhere, and gave into his urge to trail behind him. Kusaka arrived to see a sex parlor in front of him. It was inside there that he encountered Mizutani and was invited into a private room. In exchange for keeping quiet, Kusaka was given a blow job.\n\nDumbfounded by Mizutani's change in personality, Kusaka is told flirtatiously by Mizutani to \"take a lesson from the real world,\" as he shows off having sex with a client...\n\nA revenge tragedy mixed with love and hate. Being tossed around by a countless fate.\n\nThese two people's love will go...?\n\n(Source: Fusion Product Inc., Omegaverse Addicted Scans)",
