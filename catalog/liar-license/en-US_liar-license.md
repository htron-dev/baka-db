## Sinopse

From the front it appears to be an elite school, but in actual fact Morinomiya Gakuin is 'thievery' (phantom theif) facility that only accepts people with an 'ability'. Sugisaki Wataru entered this school under his brother's name. As the younger of a set of twins born in the Sugisaki family, a family that has been producing generations of 'thieves', he was ostracised by the branch family for being unable to materialise an ability. His older brother Yahiro also did not materialise an ability however, he demonstrated a superb ability to lie and aimed to be a theif that deceived all. But due to a certain incident, and possibly some intention, he left this world. In place of his elder brother Wataru is determined to become a thief and win over the other ability holders...
