    "sinopse": "Natsugami remains remembering the beautiful boy he once met in an abandoned building named Aki. It was due to trauma after seeing him being violated by someone in that same place.\n\nHis junior, Miyoshi, confessed to him but he couldn’t embark on another journey of feelings because of these memories. In order to face Miyoshi’s feelings and his past to unravel more details of Aki, he went back to that abandoned place, with Miyoshi tailing him.\n\n(Source: J Publishing, translated)",
