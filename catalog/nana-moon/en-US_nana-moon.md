## Sinopse

There is a mysterious Nana Moon in the universe with lovely little moonies as residents. One day, a girl named Coco from the Earth suddenly appeared, which reminded the moonies of an old saying that whenever a catastrophe would happen, a human with magic power will surely come from the Earth to help them discover 7 treasures to rescue Nana Moon.
