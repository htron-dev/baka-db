## Sinopse

Former gang leader Kotarou has always had to live with the hardship of his pretty face. He's the young owner of a bath-house and he's leading a carefree life until he meets Chitose, an innocent rich boy who is always being bullied—and his peaceful life changes! Moreover, it seems that Chitose's feelings are more than just an admiration. But is Kotarou confused only because he's not used to being liked by people?

Tantalizing and precious, this is the story of their first love.
