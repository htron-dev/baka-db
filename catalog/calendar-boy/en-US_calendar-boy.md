## Sinopse

Calendar Boy depicts the whimsical adventures of human personifications of national holidays on the Japanese calendar. Focusing on gags that are tied to stereotypes and images typically associated with holidays in Japan, like "New Year's Day" is a traditional Japanese individual, "Coming of Age Day" likes to drink, and "Valentine's Day" is an unrepentant casanova.
