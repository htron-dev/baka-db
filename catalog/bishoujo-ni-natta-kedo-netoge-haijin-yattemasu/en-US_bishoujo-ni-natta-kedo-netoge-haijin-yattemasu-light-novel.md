## Sinopse

The story follows the high school student Jintarou Futsu, whose confession was rejected by his crush. His misfortune continues, as news of a gender-change disease turns Jintarou into a beautiful silver haired girl. The shock of it causes him to try to escape from reality by playing the VRMMO, Clan/Clan...

His game character uses the same girl appearance as in real life, and the Alchemy skill, which most players call a trash skill. He meets lots of fellow adventurers, and becomes stronger within the game world of Clan/Clan's slogan, "When one becomes an adventurer, they can fight, steal, control, explore, invent, create, and do anything as they like."

He meets a wide variety of adventurers that help him grow, while hiding what happened to his appearance as a bug to his friends who also play the game, and hides the fact that he had become a girl in real life. When summer break is over, he will have to show his face at school.

This is about one of the best National-class adventurers, the story of the Alchemist who won a war without even taking a single step. When a normal high school student suddenly turns into a beautiful girl, what would they do? The answer is to that is to become a net-game addict!
