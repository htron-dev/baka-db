    "sinopse": "Souta Matoi is an overworked office worker tired of his life. Then, on his way home from a long day of work one day, he decides to watch a traditional Japanese play. But something strange happens. He could have sworn he saw one of the actors has cat ears.\n\nIt turns out that the man is actually a bakeneko—a shapeshifting cat from Japanese folklore. And then, the cat speaks: \"From now on, you will be my spouse.\"\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
