    "sinopse": "As a child, Nunnaly Hell was entranced by the receptionist at the magic guild Haare. She admired how the lady handled everything that came her way, sending off heroes as they ventured out. Since then, Nunnaly has aspired to become a receptionist herself.\n\nEnrolling in Dolan Kingdom's Magic Academy, she aims to be the best. However, the noble Alves Lockmann is always preventing her from being at the top. From simple games like rock-paper-scissors to greater trials like exams, Nunnaly has always been second best. The years quickly pass, and though unable to beat Lockmann, Nunnaly graduates second in her class with a recommendation letter to Haare.\n\nBeginning her new job is not so easy; the days are hectic and many trials come her way. To make matters worse, even though they chose different careers, she still can't seem to get away from Lockmann!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
