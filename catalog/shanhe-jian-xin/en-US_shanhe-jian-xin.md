## Sinopse

Yan Wushi had walked a path full of blood and corpses. He did not believe in the good nature of humanity. Even more so, he did not believe that there could be someone with great kindness and sense of justice, who would be so considerate of others without asking anything in return. One day, Shen Qiao, who was the sect leader of Mount Xuandu, the number one Daoist sect under the heavens, was challenged to a duel but somehow fell off the cliff. Yan Wushi happened to pass by down there. Seeing Shen Qiao who was seriously injured to the point of dying, he suddenly came up with a perfect idea… After thousands of autumns, who could stay eternal?
