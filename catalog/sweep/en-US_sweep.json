    "sinopse": "The city at the end of the railroad tracks, Minami, was once famous for its hot springs, but now it's just a small country town. While walking her dog one day, Satoko, who was born and raised in Minami, accidentally ends up discovering a new hot spring! However, she finds it on a construction site belonging to the neighboring city Kita.\n\nNow the dispute arises; does this new hot spring belong to its discoverer and the city of Minami, or to the owner of the land, Kita? Naturally, the best way to decide this is with a curling match! Since she's the hot springs founder, Satoko is going to be the Minami team's leader. Satoko and her friends are determined not to lose, but they don't really know anything about the sport of curling! Will they be able to defeat Kita and help Minami regain its hot springs fame!?",
