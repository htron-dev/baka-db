## Sinopse

Teenager Murakami Chisato was sick of her granny panties and was hoping she would get lingerie that was more modern. Then out of nowhere, on her way to school, a pair of sexy lingerie falls from the sky. Confused at where it came from but excited by what she found, Chisato decides to keep the bra and panty. Little does she know that they were actually Miracle Lingerie from space that absorbs sun light and gives the user extreme amounts of power. She now has such powers as the strength to lift cars, the agility to leap from house to house and insane running speeds. The only drawback is that she has to take off her clothes and expose the lingerie she is wearing to the world for it to give her powers.

Her classmate, Umeko (aka Plum) Sainoji, also has Miracle Lingerie and is scheming to take Chisato’s pair from her. Chisato’s classmate, Kudou Daisuke is a pervert and tries hard to make her take off her clothes to reveal her underwear. How will Chisato juggle between being a normal school girl, saving the world using her new powers, thwarting Umeko’s plans AND fighting off Daisuke’s perverted motives?
