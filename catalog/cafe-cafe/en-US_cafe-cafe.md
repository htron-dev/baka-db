## Sinopse

The troubles of Kazuno, proprietor of the Japanese-style café "An", are thus: There aren't enough customers, the coffee she makes is really horrible, and… she's getting stalker-ish marriage proposals from her regular customer, the Arabian prince Ashraf!? With no regard for their differences in social status! A nutty, princely comedy!
