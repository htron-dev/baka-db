## Sinopse

Jirou is the butler of Hikari Nishinomiya, a young and cold-hearted lady. As the young mistress completely disregards other people's feelings, Jirou has become exhausted. Thankfully, his friend Rene Akai has a solution for him. Using black magic, Rene plans to develop a white knight who will be able to solve any problem.

She aims to accomplish this with the help of a mysterious grimoire that can control human nature called the Tanut Codex, also known as the Cookie Cutter. Upon using its powers on a black ominous sludge lifeform, Rene successfully creates Kraunessa—a joyful and pure being with a tomboyish female appearance. Having been made for the purpose of assisting others, Kraunessa strives to be as useful as possible. However, as this artificial human aids more people, Kraunessa slowly starts to realize that just like good and evil, solutions to conflicts are ambiguous...
