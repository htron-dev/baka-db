    "sinopse": "University student Kiyotaka Hirose finds a love letter tucked into the pages of a borrowed book. The intended recipient is a mystery, but the writer's identity is clear: a fellow student who's suddenly leaving Tokyo and heading back to his hometown. Hirose is determined to return the letter, and as he tries to do so he runs into a black-market match seller, Seiji Hanashiro. Drawn to each other at first sight, tangled up in destiny and their own feelings, the men see their lives turned upside down by a single love letter.\n\n(Source: SuBLime)",
