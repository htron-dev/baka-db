A former delinquent who loves Yaoi, a beautiful but sharp-tongued teacher, a high school girl who throws herself on the ground to apologize, a French history buff…This is a tale of manga school life, that illustrates the youth, the successes, and the failures of manga school students!\n\n(Source: Silent Manga Audition)",
