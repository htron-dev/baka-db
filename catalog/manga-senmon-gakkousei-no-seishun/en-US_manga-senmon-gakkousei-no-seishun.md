## Sinopse

Dreaming of becoming a popular manga artist, Urashima-kun enters a manga school called "Tokyo Manga Academy." With a mixture of hope and anxiety, he takes his first step into the world of manga creation… where he encounters all sorts of strange characters! A former delinquent who loves Yaoi, a beautiful but sharp-tongued teacher, a high school girl who throws herself on the ground to apologize, a French history buff…This is a tale of manga school life, that illustrates the youth, the successes, and the failures of manga school students!
