This is a story about a showdown between magic and science.

horrifying power of magic to humans, the King of Evil challenges Dr. Higeta to a competition between science and magic.

Backed by a scientist from Mars named Tyrol, Dr. Higeta, his nephew Kenichi, and niece Hanako together begin the match.
