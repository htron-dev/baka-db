## Sinopse

April 1945, Okinawa. While Japan has been at war for some time now, the small tropical island of Japan still seems untouched by conflict. It is there that little Tomiko lives in joy and good humor, despite the absence of her mother. However, when the bombing begins and her father has to go to the warfront, her daily life changes. Now, she will have to survive... survive against all odds!!
