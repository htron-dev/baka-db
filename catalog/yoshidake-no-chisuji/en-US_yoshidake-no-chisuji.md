## Sinopse

The Yoshida household is all male except for Takako, who married into the family. Surrounded by her husband Akihiko, son-in-law Takeshi, father-in-law Heihachi and grandfather-in-law Heihachi, it is a very testosterone heavy family. Being the only female in the house, she has been receiving unwanted male attention and it is getting awkward. Even though they are family, they are not related by blood.
