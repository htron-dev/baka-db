    "sinopse": "The queen of the Magical World is selected through a competition in which two young witches travel to the Human World to gather the hearts of boys who fall in love with them. This time, best friends Chocolat Meilleure and Vanilla Mieux, the daughters of the previous queen candidates, enroll in a human school in order to commence the challenge. Aided by their familiar spirits and mentor Rockin Robin, the young witches learn to adjust to human life as each aims to become the next queen.\n\nChocolat, who is popular with boys in the Magical World, finds that her strategies do not work well for capturing human hearts. In contrast, Vanilla's quiet and shy personality seems to make her the center of attraction. To make matters more complicated, a mysterious boy by the name of Pierre Tempête de Neige seems to be after Chocolat's heart. The two witches' friendship is put to the test as the competition intensifies.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
