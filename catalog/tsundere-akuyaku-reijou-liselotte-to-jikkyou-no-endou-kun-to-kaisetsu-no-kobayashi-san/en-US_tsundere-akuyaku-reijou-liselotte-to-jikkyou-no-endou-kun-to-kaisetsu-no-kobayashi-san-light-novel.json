    "sinopse": "\"She's always putting on that grumpy face even though she's not actually that upset! Oh, why can't she just be honest with herself...?!\"\n\n\"She is a tsundere, after all? When her embarrassment levels exceed a certain limit, she will explode into anger. However, the point that she's suppressing under the surface is that she wouldn't mind that sort of thing if it were in a less public place.\"\n\nAs Endou-kun passionately reacts to the antics of Lady Liselotte, the villainess of an otome game, Kobayashi-san provides a painstaking breakdown of her tsundere behavior. Suddenly, one person could hear their voices; Liselotte's fiancé, Prince Siegward. That is where this story begins.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
