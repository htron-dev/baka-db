In the omegaverse, alphas, betas, and omegas are born into inequality. One day, as three little boys played in the mountains, their hometown Omega Forest came under attack of the alphas. The three boys survived but were never the same again. Twenty years after their world flipped upside down, Homura, Satsuki, and Minato begin their revenge on alphas to avenge their fellow omegas who fell victim to the brutal attack. Their name: Dark Omega. Their goal: Get revenge on alphas. Their weapon: Pheromones...!? The Dark Omega execute their plans, but they won't have an easy time terrorizing the country when the Alpha Rangers come to fight back!
