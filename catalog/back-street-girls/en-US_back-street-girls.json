    "sinopse": "Would you give up being human—or would you become... an idol? A trio of yakuza achieve the impossible and debut as idols—and become a big hit to boot! Under the guidance of their fiendish and overcontrolling boss, three former yakuza men undergo a complete makeover and debut as the back street girl idols \"Gokudols.\" In their dressing room, they drink alcohol and gamble, but in front of their fans, they're idols through and through. The idol gag manga \"without honor\" that everyone's talking about has finally been released. Is this what Japan's idol industry has come to?!\n\n(Source: Kodansha Comics USA)",
