She travels to an anonymous Western city, a bizarre dreamscape cluttered with elements from works by Dali, Magritte, de Chirico and Escher. The journey will change her completely but when she returns she will be the only one who knows how she has changed.\n(The poem in the film is by Su Tong-Po, a famous Chinese poet)\n\n-AniDB",
