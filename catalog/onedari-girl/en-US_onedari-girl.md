## Sinopse

Meguna Hirasawa has confessed 5000 times in total to her 10 year long crush Ayumu and in turn, received 5000 rejections. But that won't stop her. In fact, Meguna is retiring from simple confessions and moving to a whole new level. That being said, Meguna is ready to dive straight into seduction! Wait, the first thing she does is smash her lips into Ayumu's face for a bloody kiss?! Will her pestering finally allow her to capture Ayumu's heart? Or will this desperate girl's hard work be in vain?
