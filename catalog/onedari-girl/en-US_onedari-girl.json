In fact, Meguna is retiring from simple confessions and moving to a whole new level. That being said, Meguna is ready to dive straight into seduction! Wait, the first thing she does is smash her lips into Ayumu's face for a bloody kiss?! Will her pestering finally allow her to capture Ayumu's heart? Or will this desperate girl's hard work be in vain?\n\n(Source: Hearty Thrills)",
