## Sinopse

After the Hero's birth, Seycred, the youngest priest of the church, is sent to take care of an abandoned chapel right across the Demon King's Castle, for it to serve as a resting place in his quest. Thus begins the relationship between a priest and the Demon Lord. Was the person with the right ability sent to the chapel, or will their encounter bring forth chaos to the nation?
