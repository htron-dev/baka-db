## Sinopse

Hisagi and the twins Mizuki and Takahi share an apartment. Hisagi is in love with Mizuki, but can't pick up his courage to confess. Takahi, who looks exactly like Hisagi's love, promises to support him and tries to make his brother jealous. But as he falls in love with Hisagi himself, a curious love triangle is formed.

Furthermore, there are three other hot BL short stories in this manga, featuring the troublesome life of a young CEO, a kindhearted doctor and a newly turned vampire.
