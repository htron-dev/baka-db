## Sinopse

While recovering from surgery, Kazuya Minekura is asked by the Zero-Sum editor-in-chief Koyagi to create a series of illustrations for the manga magazine Zero-Sum WARD. To create a theme, Koyagi rolls four dice: two hold character names, one holds a situation, and the last holds an action. With each roll, characters are placed in strange situations, much to Minekura's chagrin.
