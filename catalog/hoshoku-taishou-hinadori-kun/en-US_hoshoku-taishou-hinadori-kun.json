    "sinopse": "Hinata's been in love with Hakuba since he was little, and they used to perform together... Now that they're both grown up though, Hinata is part of the \"bad boy\" boy band who (for marketing purposes?) hates the pop duo Hakuba is in. Hinata has tried to hide his true feelings for Hakuba, but his group leader, Takaomi, sees right through him. Trying to help Hinata get it together on stage, Takaomi kisses him in front of all their fans during the live battle of the bands!\n\n(Source: Renta!, edited)",
