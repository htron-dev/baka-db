## Sinopse

Seiya is an acclaimed star and a genius student who is liked by everyone. Even so, Seiya has a hidden side to him that no one knows about... Lately, he can't stop thinking about Tatsumi, who's in the same year as him.

One night, just as they had started bonding together, Seiya confessed his feelings to Tatsumi and kissed him. But all of this occurred in front of a cemetery, which freaked out the scaredy cat, Tatsumi. And because he was scared, Tatsumi was unable to reciprocate with honesty.

But the next day, their relation became...?!

This is a series of love stories in an all boys institute!
