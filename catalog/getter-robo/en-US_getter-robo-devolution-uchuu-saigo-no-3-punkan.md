## Sinopse

They call them Devolved—strange alien creatures that attack our world through distortions in space. Tragedy has always haunted Ryouma, and when his high school comes under alien attack, he figures it's just the latest chapter in a long history of suffering. Yet beneath the monster's deadly glare, a strange professor steps forth with an offer of power. Ryouma is touched by the Getter Rays, a mysterious cosmic force that grants the power to pilot the ultimate fighting machine: Getter Robo!
