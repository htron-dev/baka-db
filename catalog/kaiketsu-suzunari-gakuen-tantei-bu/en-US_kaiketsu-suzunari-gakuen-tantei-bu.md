## Sinopse

The Suzunari high school detective club which consists of three good looking high school students; Suzaku Tachibana, Kouhei Hiba, Soutaro Tsubaki, and a cat called Boo-chan. Boo-chan holds the power to decide the girls who get to join the club. Since there hasn't been any girls Boo-chan approved so far, the club has been a boy-only club since the first day. Until the day Suzaku used his intuition to scout Aoi Kaidou, who he thought would be a cute girl. This was approved by Boo-chan, but she turned out to be a girl who is weird and doesn't smile... This is high school tale about the detective club of 4 students and one cat solving incidents on campus.
