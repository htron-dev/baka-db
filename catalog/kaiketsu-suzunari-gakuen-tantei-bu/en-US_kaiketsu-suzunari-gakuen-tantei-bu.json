Boo-chan holds the power to decide the girls who get to join the club. Since there hasn't been any girls Boo-chan approved so far, the club has been a boy-only club since the first day. Until the day Suzaku used his intuition to scout Aoi Kaidou, who he thought would be a cute girl. This was approved by Boo-chan, but she turned out to be a girl who is weird and doesn't smile...
