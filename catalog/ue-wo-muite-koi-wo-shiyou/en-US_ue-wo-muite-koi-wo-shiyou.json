    "sinopse": "One day, Kaede Tachibana, a salaryman who has no self-confidence, finds himself dumped by his lover. Even when his sister takes him to visit a host club, all he can do in his state of depression is drown himself in alcohol. There, the owner of the host club, Tsunayoshi, appears, and a drunk Kaede pours all of his feelings out to Tsunayoshi. \"Let me help you\" is the last thing Kaede hears before he loses consciousness. Waking up, Kaede finds himself lying naked in a bed that he has never seen before?!\n\n(Source: Taiyo Tosho, translated)",
