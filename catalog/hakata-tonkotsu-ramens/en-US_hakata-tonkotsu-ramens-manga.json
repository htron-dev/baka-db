The city's Hakata ward is home to the professionals of the underworld: professional killers, detectives, informants, professional revenge seekers, those skilled in torture, and more. And according to urban legend, even a \"killer of professional killers\" exists in the city. When stories of the men in the underworld are told, a \"professional killer murder\" appears.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
