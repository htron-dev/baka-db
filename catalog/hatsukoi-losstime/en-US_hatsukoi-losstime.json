    "sinopse": "Suddenly visited Aiba Kouji who had been living a school life unrelated to girls, the strange phenomenon “loss time” where the time stopped for only one hour per day. In such a still world, Kouji who wants to regain his youth meets a young girl, Shinomiya Tokine, who has a scarlet-eyed eye that can move in the same time when she stopped. In a world where only two people move, the distance gradually decreases, and eventually the feelings for Tokine sound change to first love. But she seems to have a big secret that obstructs her thoughts.\n\n(Source: MU)",
