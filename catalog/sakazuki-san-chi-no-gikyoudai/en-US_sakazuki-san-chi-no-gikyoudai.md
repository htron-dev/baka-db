## Sinopse

Youichi's a gruff, taciturn boy who attends a school full of delinquents; Chikage is naive, friendly student of a prestigious academy. These two very different boys become stepbrothers and suddenly find themselves living under the same roof. This is a comedy about their day-to-day lives.
