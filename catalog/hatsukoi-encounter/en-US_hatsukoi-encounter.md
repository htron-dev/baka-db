## Sinopse

Mine thought his high school life would be just like a movie. He would fall in love, confess, and have a girlfriend. But, that's not how Mine's high school love story goes. Instead, Mine meets Hachikaku, a fellow student suffering from erectile dysfunction. Through a series of movie-esque jumps, Mine rouses Hachikaku's slumbering junior.
