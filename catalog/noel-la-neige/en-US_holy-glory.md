## Sinopse

19th century England. Christmas Day.

A young thief, Salt, and his partner-in-crime Pierre come across a strange-looking traveller with a penchant for sweets. The only thing of value Salt finds in the traveller’s bag is an odd compass, so he steals it – only for monsters to come after him a few hours later! Why are they after Salt? And what does the traveller want with him?? It’s a fantastic winter tale of magic!
