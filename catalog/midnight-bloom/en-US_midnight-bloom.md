## Sinopse

Everybody knows Tatsuki - is a star performer at the Academy of Performing Arts. When he is on stage, he is very expressive and full of energy but off the stage he's the complete opposite - especially when it comes to his relationships.
He had a crush on someone a long time ago and it ended up crashing and burning, but that's all that's in the past now.
Several years later, he meets someone new and this someone changes his life and his personality. Will Tatsuki gets his happy ending this time?
(Based on DokiDoki's synopsis).
