En Asakura is having the same dream lately. She dreams of a boy asking her to kiss him. Her dream is connected to a painful memory from her high-school life when she felt in love with a boy named Maru. When he asked her to kiss him she refused and now she’s regretting that act. Not to mention that the boy started to date another girl after that incident. En is now in university and is trying to find her life partner through “blind group dates” named goukon. What will she do when a boy with the same name as her past crush asks for her number? Will she refuse and regret it again?
