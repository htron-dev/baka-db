## Sinopse

Aika, a novelist, has been able to see ayakashi since he was little. Because of all of the ayakashi around him, Aika did not get along with humans. The only one who stayed around him was his now deceased dog, Shiro. One day, he meets an ayakashi that looks similar to Shiro. This ayakashi, Rintarou, is a mysterious being who likes humans and is engaged in social life as a person. Moved by the bright sun-like Rintarou, Aika's awareness changes little by little. However, one day, Aika is suddenly told by Rintarou that he loves him!?
