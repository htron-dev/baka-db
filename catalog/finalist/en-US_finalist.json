    "sinopse": "Finalist's story takes place in a college town somewhere in Japan. The protagonist of the story, Yoshiki Shirasagi, is a male high school student. When he entered high school, he was mistakenly given a room in the girl's dormitory due to his feminine name. This did not bode well with Yoshiki, but he eventually ended up taking the room in the end since there was no more room left in the boy's dormitory. Yoshiki meets many of the girls who live in the same dormitory.",
