## Sinopse

Yorika is in the middle of chasing her beloved Shiiba-senpai. Seeing him every day takes her to her happy place, but her father suddenly has to transfer overseas! Not being able to see Shiiba everyday is not possible for Yorika. She uses the internet to find a room to rent, but just when she believes that the problem is settled, the person she is supposed to live under the same roof with is... somehow extremely cool, but... it's a boy!
