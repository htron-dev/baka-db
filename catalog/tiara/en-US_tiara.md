## Sinopse

Prashian is an aristocratic line gifted with 500 years of life and special powers. Elan are "normal people" who live 100 years. In this place where these two "peoples" live together, there is a Litra Palia living in among them without knowing her own name. Following the orders of servants, she lives off the charity provided by the Prashian among the Elan. She is but a "pet".
