## Sinopse

In a world where gigantic, ferocious monsters and humans live together, monster hunters exist to protect humanity from becoming extinct. Raiga is a hot headed but passionate warrior that relies on his brute strength to cut through monsters. Keres uses his long range attacks to asses the situation calmly and calculate the ideal next move. Tolche is timid and shy but her deadly traps are anything but cute. These three hunters decide to form a team to hunt the deadliest of monsters hundreds of times their size and impossible to kill alone.
