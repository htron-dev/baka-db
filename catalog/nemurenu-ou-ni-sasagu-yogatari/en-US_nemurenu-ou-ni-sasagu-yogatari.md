## Sinopse

The Sleepless King summons young ladies to the palace every night and make them tell him bedtime stories, and the penalty for failing to lull him to sleep is death. The one who finally managed to sooth the king to sleep is Lady Farasha, who volunteered as the storyteller in order to save her imprisoned father. But how was she able to accomplish the impossible? Is there more to the relationship between the Sleepless King and Lady Farasha than what meets the eye?
