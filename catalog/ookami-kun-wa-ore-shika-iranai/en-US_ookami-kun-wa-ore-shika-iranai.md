## Sinopse

Taishi Odagiri wishes he weren't so short. Thanks to his height, he hasn't had a girlfriend for 17 years... let alone been intimate with a girl. Deciding to do something about it, Taishi goes to Haruomi Tsukamoto, a tall, unfriendly guy who Taishi feels has all the qualities he's always wanted in himself... but then, Haruomi proposes Taishi be his girlfriend for a while!! Taishi agrees to do this to learn how to "be a man," but on their date that day, Haruomi suddenly kisses him...!
