## Sinopse

His last memory?—The electric chair, the cowl, the hand of the executive which lowers a control lever…

When he reopens eyes, Ash has only vague notions of the fact that was its life, and more still, circumstances of its death. The androgyne Angel announces him that he was a victim of a miscarriage of justice and that he means, at the moment, avoiding the same fate to the other innocents.
