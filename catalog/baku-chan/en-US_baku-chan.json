    "sinopse": "A little tapir boy comes from his planet to immigrate to the Earth. All of the things here are entirely new for him. Let's have a fantastic adventure with this brave boy!\n\nBaku-chan, a little tapir from the planet Baku, immigrates to Earth and comes to live with Hana, a human girl who has come from Nagoya to live in Tokyo. Baku-chan comes into contact with new and different things in everyday life and encounters discrimination toward immigrants. However, he also gets support from Hana and other friendly Earthlings, and also from his immigrant friends, and lives a cheerful and robust life. Masumura's experiences as an immigrant in Canada are reflected in a story depicted through colorful and fantastically designed drawings. While heartwarming, the story also depicts immigrant situations and feelings that could come about in the real world, including thoughtless violence, pressure to conform, and the difficulty of adapting to a new land. It is an adventure that poses questions for society.\n\n(Source: MU)",
