## Sinopse

In a world called Barzel exists a particular profession called Private Military Firms or more commonly known as PMFs. They take on any particular job ranging from stealing to security as long as the price is right. Lynbell, Zephyr and Vashyron joined alliances to take on jobs and have been doing decently even in this highly competitive and cut throat industry. However, lately, there has been a mysterious figure who has always been one step ahead of them, taking their jobs and keeping them from making money. And now, it seems that person is their new client.
