## Sinopse

Alice Amakawa was 10 years old when her mother and family servant left the house. Now 16 years old, Alice lives with only a small talking pet she calls Papi and one duty: to keep the house and the rest of Nemiki City away from the family pets—plushie-like but very destructive aliens known as Cosmofs. With this exhausting task and six long years of solitude, Alice hopes for nothing but her small family to return.

On her birthday, Alice's monotonous life begins to change as she soon becomes a target of the Space Police due to her mother's connection to the Cosmofs as well as her own ability to hunt them. During her escape, the Cosmofs make one simple request that begins an adventure that transcends time, leaving Alice several years in the past where she meets a younger Raika Amakawa and her servant Imori. Alice is glad to see the family that she has long wished to see again, but as fate would have it, her happiness is not guaranteed to last...
