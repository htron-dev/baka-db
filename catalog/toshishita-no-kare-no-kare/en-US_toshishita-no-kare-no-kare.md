## Sinopse

To Kuniyoshi, university student Akamatsu, who's 5 years younger than him, is very cute with his dazzlingly pure eyes and straightforward words. These two earnestly tell each other their feelings and are always lovey-dovey. This is a pure sweet story on how the two honestly put into words their bashful and embarrassing thoughts.
