## Sinopse

In order to present a report for his class, college student Niwa Kyouichi had to pair up with Sakashita Hitomi, a taciturn guy who lets his hair and beard grow wild, wears unattractive clothing, and is difficult to understand. At first, Kyouichi thought it would be hard dealing with Hitomi, but as they spent more time together, Kyouichi discovered the appealing aspects of Hitomi’s personality. Wanting others to know about this side of Hitomi, Kyouichi started thinking about a plan for Hitomi’s makeover...!?
