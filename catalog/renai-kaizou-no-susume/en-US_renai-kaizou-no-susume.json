At first, Kyouichi thought it would be hard dealing with Hitomi, but as they spent more time together, Kyouichi discovered the appealing aspects of Hitomi’s personality. Wanting others to know about this side of Hitomi, Kyouichi started thinking about a plan for Hitomi’s makeover...!?\n\n(Source: Eternal Dream)",
