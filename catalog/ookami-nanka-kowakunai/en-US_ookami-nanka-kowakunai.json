But why's he being such a jerk and pretending he doesn't know her? Moe's gotta be creative and use her wits if she wants to survive the new schoolyear with her virtue intact. Who's gonna protect the lone princess, from a school full of wolves?\n\n(Source: Condensation)\n\nThis one-shot volume also includes two extra stories.",
