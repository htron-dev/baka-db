    "sinopse": "Ever wondered what goes on behind the closed doors of the teachers' lounge? At Asashio High, the new school year brings new faces, both in the student body and on staff.

From romantic entanglements to otaku obsessions, these teachers just go to show that the fun doesn't have to end after high school!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
