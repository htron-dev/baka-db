## Sinopse

Momotarou is a masked wrestler and a descendant of his legendary warrior namesake. Combining the ferocity of pro wrestling with lighthearted gags, this manga knows how to make the wrestling ring exciting. Throw in characters based on famous figures from fables such as Kintarou and Urashima, and you have yourself a recipe for white-knuckle showdown!
