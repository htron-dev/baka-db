## Sinopse

Ever since Tsubaki Tarou, who lives alone in the city, was coincidentally reunited with his childhood friend Hiraiwa who is now divorced (with a child), his life started to subtly change. Tsubaki naturally integrates himself into Hiraiwa and Fumio's family, slowly adding colour to their lives. A heart-warming story depicting the warm interaction between people and their tender lives.
