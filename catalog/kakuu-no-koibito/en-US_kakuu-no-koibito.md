## Sinopse

Seduction is on the agenda!

As far as secretary Gina Leighton is concerned, billionaire businessman Harry Breedon has never shown more than a professional interest in her. Why should he? Plain and plump, Gina knows she's hardly trophy--wife material!

But Harry has noticed her--sexy curves and all--and now that Gina has another job offer, he'll have to act fast. This handsome tycoon is determined to seduce her into staying--even if that means making her his wife!
