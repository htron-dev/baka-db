    "sinopse": "Seduction is on the agenda!\n\nAs far as secretary Gina Leighton is concerned, billionaire businessman Harry Breedon has never shown more than a professional interest in her. Why should he? Plain and plump, Gina knows she's hardly trophy--wife material!\n\nBut Harry has noticed her--sexy curves and all--and now that Gina has another job offer, he'll have to act fast. This handsome tycoon is determined to seduce her into staying--even if that means making her his wife!\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
