## Sinopse

Sou Tsukishiro chose to enter the same high school as his childhood friend Kashiwagi, for whom he secretly has feelings for. He happily spends each day at school with her, despite knowing that she chose to go to this school to chase after her first and current love interest.

Sou's eyes possess a special ability inherited from his vampire father, called "Temptation." Its power allows the user to make anyone their "captive" just by making eye contact with them. These "captives" will do anything for their "master" no matter how dangerous or unfavorable it is. Sou sealed this power because it led to the death of his mother, but it unexpectedly ends up activating. A story of a pure, dark love twisted by the power to control the hearts of others.
