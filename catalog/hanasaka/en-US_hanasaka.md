## Sinopse

Hanasaki Koji has the most awesome body ever. Whenever he consumes alcohol, he produces a powerful pheromone that women are physically unable to resist and they literally jump on him and beg him to please them. There are drawbacks, however, in that it gets in the way of pursuing a teaching career and having a peaceful normal day. He lands a position as a teacher in training at his younger sister’s high school and meets Seno Sanae who he is going to work under. But Koji knows that a student body and faculty full of females is a recipe for disaster.
