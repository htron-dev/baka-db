## Sinopse

For the first time in thirteen years, Rosemary runs into Willis, her former classmate, and is shocked at how he's changed. Back in high school she was attractive and popular, and Rosemary wrote off Willis as a scrawny nerd who was only good at studying. Now, he's a professor at an acclaimed university and has come back to her village to observe a passing comet...and she can't help but observe his stellar body. During his stay in the village, he'll be sleeping over at Rosemary's house. Will more than the comet be keeping him up at night?
