## Sinopse

Couverture, a specialty store run by a pair of handsome brothers dealing in fine chocolates,

For the times when you are swaying in between career and love.
For the times you are troubled awaiting a spring romance.
For the times when you feel like you have forgotten how to smile or be gentle.

If you take one step into the shop, you will understand the flavor of happiness they want to share with everyone.
