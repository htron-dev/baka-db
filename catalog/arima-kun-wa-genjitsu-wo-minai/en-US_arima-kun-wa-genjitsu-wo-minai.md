## Sinopse

Arima is a positive individual who always mistaken other people's words to his own convenience in an all boy's school. Despite that, in order to win everyone's expectation (delusion) and good will (delusion), Arima will continue to try hard today!

And so begins the delusional comedy with Arima standing on the fine line between cute and annoying.
