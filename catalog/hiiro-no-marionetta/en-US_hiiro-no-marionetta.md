After the woman he loves, Erika, dies of an illness, Jeanie sees no reason to keep on living. He used to be an artist who painted beautiful blue skies, but now he hasn't even got the desire to do that anymore.

One day, a strange girl called Coppelia comes into his life. Is she a shinigami, finally come to lead him to his beloved Erika in the afterlife? Or is she something more sinister, a dangerous marionette who has her own reasons for seeking his life?
