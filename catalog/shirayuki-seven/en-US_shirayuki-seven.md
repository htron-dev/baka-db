## Sinopse

You would normally call girls who love little boys “shota-cons.” Well, Ahiru goes beyond that as her fetish, obsession, and life is all about little boys. Although she denies accepting the fact that she is a pervert for little boys, her friends know that she is indeed a shota-con. Ahiru’s dream was to marry a young prince, and her dream has somewhat become reality when a new student, Shirayuki (little boy, of course), transferred into her school. The next day mysterious phenomena suddenly strike the school, Ahiru gets a fever and appears in an alternate dimension. As she opens the door to the infirmary, she sees Shirayuki in a throne, and is told that she is to become the wife of the prince, the prince of the devil’s world. Wait, the prince of the devil’s world!? What the hell is going on here!?
