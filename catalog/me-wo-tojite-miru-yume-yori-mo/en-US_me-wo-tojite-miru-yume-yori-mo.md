## Sinopse

Yuki is owner of the Fuuka Cafe. When a man with a single rucksack comes to the store and insists, "Hire me," Yuki is forced to take him on as a live-in employee. The food Kamishiro, Yuki's new employee, cooks in the kitchen is top-class and he is willing to work for less than $5 an hour!?! However, Yuki's live-in worker really appears to be a live-in lover and one day he is attacked. Kamishiro is left to soothe Yuki's injuries and temper. But, Yuki is a strong believer that kissing wounds make them all better.
