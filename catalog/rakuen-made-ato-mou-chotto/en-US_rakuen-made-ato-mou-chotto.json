    "sinopse": "Takashi Asada who works as a debt collector, is having an affair with his boss Kikuchi, the president of Loans Kikuchi. They keep their relationship a secret from Kikuchi's wife--however, they are nearly found out when Kikuchi accidentally drops a ring from his pocket--ring matching the one Asada is wearing. They are saved by Tsutomu Kawae, who came to negotiate postponement of a debt repayment on behalf of his ex-wife and her family running a travel agency. Tsutomu takes the ring and pretends to be Asada's lover... now the debt collectors are indebted to Tsutomu and Asada is forced to 'test-ride' Tsutomu's new mountain-climbing vacation which is supposed to bring money to the travel agency and enable them to repay the debt. However, despite his initial dislike for mountain-climbing, Asada seems to be charmed by the newly discovered mountain paradise... or perhaps by Tsutomu?",
