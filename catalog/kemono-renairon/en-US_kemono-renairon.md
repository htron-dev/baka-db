## Sinopse

Collection of short stories:

• Kemono Renairon

• Karakuchi Kakumei
Natsui has always liked the chairman of the student council, Kazuki Oda. But ever since a long time ago, she's been bad at dealing with people. She easily gets nervous, and, to hide her embarrassment, always puts on a hard face. So how will she be able to make her feelings reach her admired Oda-kun?!

• Sore wa, Nigai, Chocolate.
Yuri hates to be alone, so she'll spend time with any guy who comes along. Chiyo Kyosuke, a teacher at her school, finds this behavior repulsive, but Yuri seems to have fallen in love with him all the same.

• Eien no "Suki" ga Hajimaru Hi
