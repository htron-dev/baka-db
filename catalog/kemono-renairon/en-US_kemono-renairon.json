But ever since a long time ago, she's been bad at dealing with people. She easily gets nervous, and, to hide her embarrassment, always puts on a hard face. So how will she be able to make her feelings reach her admired Oda-kun?!\n\n• Sore wa, Nigai, Chocolate.\nYuri hates to be alone, so she'll spend time with any guy who comes along. Chiyo Kyosuke, a teacher at her school, finds this behavior repulsive, but Yuri seems to have fallen in love with him all the same.\n\n• Eien no \"Suki\" ga Hajimaru Hi\n\n(from M-U)",
