## Sinopse

Ayumu Arimura is quiet and shy girl, which is why she's bullied endlessly at school, and at her foster home, she's treated like air. Every day is just painful.

Ayumu finally decides she can't take it anymore and runs away. She ends up in a small shop full of beautiful, luxurious bags. With no place left to to go back to, she asks the owner if she can work there...
