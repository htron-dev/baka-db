## Sinopse

Karina's childhood friend Ikumi-kun had moved away in primary school, but he is now returning because of his father's remarriage; not only that, they are next door neighbors! The volleyball club that she has joined as a manager of course includes Ikumi, but also another childhood friend, Yasu, Ikumi's older stepbrother Miyuki-san, and the demon-like Arisaka-senpai, all members with rich personalities. What will become of Karina's high school life?!
