## Sinopse

When Satoshi oversleeps on his 10th birthday, he ends up with a stubborn Pikachu instead of the first partner Pokemon he wanted! But after a rocky start, Satoshi and Pikachu become close friends and true partners—and when they catch a rare glimpse of the Legendary Pokemon Ho-Oh in flight, they make plans to seek it out together.

Trainers Makoto and Souji join Satoshi on his journey, and along the way, they meet the mysterious Mythical Pokemon Marshadow. When they near their goal, an arrogant Trainer named Cross stands in their way. Can Satoshi and Pikachu defeat him and reach Ho-Oh as they promised, or will their journey end here?
