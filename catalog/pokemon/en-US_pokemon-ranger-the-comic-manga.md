## Sinopse

In yet another area of the Pokemon world, there are no trainers, only rangers who temporarily borrow the service of wild Pokemon for good.

The main character finds himself on an almost impossible mission, and discovers with the Pokemon he has borrowed from the Pokemon he has gathered, hopefully a way to stop the evildoers who have started havoc.
