## Sinopse

Be Master!! Pokemon Black & White first premiered in the October 2010 issue of CoroCoro Comics Special. It is being promoted by CoroCoro Comics as a "walkthrough comic."

The comic follows the story of a young boy named Monta, filling the role of the male protagonist from Pocket Monsters Black & White, as he travels through the Isshu Region with his friends Cheren and Bel. Throughout his journey, he and his Tsutarja learn about many of the new gameplay mechanics introduced in the fifth generation games such as capturing wild pokemon in double battles and pulling off combination techniques.
