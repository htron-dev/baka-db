## Sinopse

On their way to participate in the next Pokémon contest, Ash, Brock, and Dawn come to Álamos Town, known for its beautiful gardens and the impressive Space-time Tower, built by the famous architect Gowdy. After mysterious swathes of destruction begin to appear and an ominous fog envelops the town, preventing the people from leaving, Tonio, Gowdy's grandson recognizes these phenomena as having been predictions in his grandfather's diary - predictions that the integrity of space and time are under threat from a battle between the legendary Pokémon Diagla and Darkrai. Will Ash and his friends be able to save Álamos Town?
