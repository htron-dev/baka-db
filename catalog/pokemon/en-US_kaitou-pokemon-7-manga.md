## Sinopse

The series is about a young boy named Hiori who leads a double life as the mysterious thief known as "Pokemon 7". Pokemon 7, along with his trusty partner Lucario, retrieves stolen objects from other thieves and returns them to their rightful owners.

During the day, Hiori works at the bread shop Sun-Sun. His co-worker, Nazuna, is a Lois Lane-type character who falls in love with Pokemon 7 while not thinking too highly of Hiori.
