Raised in the wild by Pokémon, he can climb as high as an Aipom, swim as fast as a Magikarp, and even eat bark like a Bidoof!\n\nRecruited by Professor Rowan, Hareta decides to become a Pokémon Trainer. Along with his first Pokémon, Piplup, and his new friend Mitsumi, he sets off in search of the legendary Pokémon Dialga. But Team Galactic is hunting for Dialga too.
