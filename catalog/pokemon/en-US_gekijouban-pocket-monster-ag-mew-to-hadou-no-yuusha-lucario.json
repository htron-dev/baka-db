Soon afterwards, the Wave Leader Pokemon \"Lucario\" is freed from his centuries-long seal and meets Satoshi. Satoshi must solve the various mysteries of where Pikachu is, what Mew's after, what the secret of the legend of the Wave Leader is and how it ties in with Lucario's hidden past as he makes his way to \"the Tree of the World's Origin\" with Lucario.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
