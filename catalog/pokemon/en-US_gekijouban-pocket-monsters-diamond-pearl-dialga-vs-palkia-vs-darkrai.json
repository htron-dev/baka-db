After mysterious swathes of destruction begin to appear and an ominous fog envelops the town, preventing the people from leaving, Tonio, Gowdy's grandson recognizes these phenomena as having been predictions in his grandfather's diary - predictions that the integrity of space and time are under threat from a battle between the legendary Pokémon Diagla and Darkrai. Will Ash and his friends be able to save Álamos Town?\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
