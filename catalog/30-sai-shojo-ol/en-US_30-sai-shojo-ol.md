## Sinopse

Hinako, a 30-year-old virgin, has always had relationship problems. Due to her phobia of dirty things, she punches any guy who touches her. Desperate to find someone to love and help her graduate from being a virgin, she takes her much younger co-worker Kai up on his offer to date his friend Machida. Will she finally be free from her virginity streak and find someone to love her despite her phobia?
