## Sinopse

Like an invitations of smell of spring, I was walking along the town, then I was suddenly kidnapped. "Huh? What!? what are you doing to me." When I woke up, I was somehow in the radio recording studio. When I turn around, there was a popular idol voice actress that I admire, Otonashi Madoka sitting across me. Whhhaaaa...what is meaning of this.

Without debate, I was put in to radio recording with her. Conversation that we do in recording is that "where do you hide your porn" and "You are hiding your porn, under your bed right?" and so on. Ahhh... What we are talking about is same subject, that's not changing the subject.
