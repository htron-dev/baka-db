## Sinopse

Matsukawa has all the qualities that would make women fall head over heels at first sight. He's good looking, has great style, is an excellent worker, treats people with kindness, and even has a great smile. It's all thanks to his "secret" efforts to make himself look that good. However, he didn't expect for his co-worker Yuuki, whom he hates, to approach him. A salarymen love story between a gentle yet sadistic junior and a senior obsessed with beauty begins!
