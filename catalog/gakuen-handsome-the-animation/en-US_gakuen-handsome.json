    "sinopse": "High school student Yoshiki Maeda is starting a new year in the all-boys Baraman High School. On the first day, Yoshiki reconnects with his childhood friend, Takuya Saotome, and meets his odd and dramatic homeroom teacher, Teruhiko Saionji. Yoshiki’s younger sister, Yuu, is aware of many of these handsome boys and seems to take pleasure in teasing her big brother about them.\n\nYoshiki soon discovers a number of stereotypical romance characters and has no choice but to deal with their outright ludicrous and nonsensical boys' love antics.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
