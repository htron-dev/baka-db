He's smart and handsome but he has a rather tough exterior. Miya, the youngest, is a senior in high school. He gets sick easily so he gets everyone's attention in the family.\n\nThey all love each other very much, but they all have secrets and desires that are yet to be explored... And everything is sure to get confusing when they all find out that one of them was adopted 21 years ago! With a love triangle amongst them and secrets that are bound to tear them apart, how will this family possibly survive?\nfrom KittyMedia",
