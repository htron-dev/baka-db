## Sinopse

Kugayama is a gifted music teacher, but a man with little ambition or desire. Born to a wealthy and prominent family, Kugayama passes his days simply going through the motions and existing. When ex-student, Azuma Tanaka, requests his help in studying for a prestigious music school's entrance exam, his budding youth and enthusiasm invoke a passion in Kugayama that he has never experienced before.
