## Sinopse

There is a girl in the hot springs deep in the forest. She easily lifts huge rocks, controls the weather, and talks to animals. The secret to her abilities are the masks she wears. The profession of this girl is a "menya," which creates masks with special powers. A craft working comic that depicts a girl who pursues this job, from cutting out wood to coloring patterns and finishing with varnishing!
