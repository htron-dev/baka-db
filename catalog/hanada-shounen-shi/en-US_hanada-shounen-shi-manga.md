## Sinopse

A little bumpkin kid by the name of Ichiro Hanada gets into all kinds of mischief until things take a turn for the nasty. Trying to escape the wrath of his enraged mother, he gets in an accident resulting in 9 stitches on the back of his head, and one little side-effect: a knack for the supernatural. Young Ichiro is now able to communicate with ghosts, who just can’t get off his back with all kinds of requests.
