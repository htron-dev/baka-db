## Sinopse

Elma, who was raised in a prison, was pardoned and released. Though she tries to heed her mother's words to be "normal," while working as a maid in the royal palace, her outlandish abilities and behavior end up shaking it up in its entirety. Completing a job in one morning that would take four people an entire day, brewing tea that tastes like it was blessed by the heavens, cutting up a giant tuna with one stroke, even surgical procedures more esoteric than healing magic are her specialty.

"This much is normal outside of prison, isn't it?"

The curtain opens on a story of an inadvertently peerless girl who had intended to be normal.
