## Sinopse

Mizuki Hijiri is a high school girl who just transferred schools. At her new school, she has a fateful encounter with boys suffering from chuunibyou (adolescent delusions of grandeur). There is Noda who dreams of becoming a hero, the tragically handsome otaku Takashima who only likes 2D girls, Nakamura the supposedly "reincarnated" angel or devil, and the self-professed string-puller Tsukumo.
