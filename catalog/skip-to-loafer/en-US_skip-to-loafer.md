## Sinopse

Iwakura Mitsumi always had big dreams, of leaving her small town, advancing to a top tier university, and then contributing to the country before retiring back to her home town. So focused is she on her goal that she is oblivious to all the other ways she comes up short, much to the chagrin and concern of her friends and family. Can a naive country girl make it in Tokyo?
