    "sinopse": "Tomita Yuri has hated boys since she was little, seeing them as the devils who taunt and tease her. So when her all-girl school Kinka academy decides to merge with the Ginka academy for boys, her ‘heaven’ is once again threatened by the devils from hell = men. Not only that, but being a member of the student council, she now has to work alongside the male student council of Ginka academy. Will Yuri’s ‘heaven’ be overrun by the male devils from hell?\n\n(Source: Aerandria)",
