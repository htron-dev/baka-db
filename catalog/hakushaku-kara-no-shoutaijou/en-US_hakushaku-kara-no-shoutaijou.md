## Sinopse

Helen, who lost her parents when she was young, was raised by her aunt. However, her aunt's business has gone bankrupt and now they're desperate. They receive an invitation from Earl Bridgemere, the patriarch of Aunt Bella's family, to his annual Christmas party. Aunt Bella usually declines, but she has no choice this year. The two decide to attend the party to ask the earl for help, but upon their arrival Aunt Bella collapses. Helen seeks assistance from an attendant... who turns out to be Earl Bridgemere himself!
