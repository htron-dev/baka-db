## Sinopse

In the Ainu language "orushipe" means "storytelling" and "suopu" means "this place."

The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC) in conjunction with various directors from Studio Rocca created short films every year starting in 2012. They tell stories from within the Ainu land and culture. These short films are featured at museums, schools, and film festivals--particularly "The New Chitose Airport International Animation Festival" who's celebrating Hokkaido's 150th anniversary (before the Boshin War the land was known as Ezochi and not formally a part of Japan).

The official YouTube channel provides various audio and subtitles combinations for the short films, roughly a year after their first showcase. And the yearly films are also released on DVD.
