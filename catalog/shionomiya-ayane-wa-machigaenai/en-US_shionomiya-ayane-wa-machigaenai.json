Ayane has a score of \"7,\" while Kurumi has a score of \"11.\" Ayane's ability allows her to control shoe laces, while Kurumi can form contracts with objects, which allow her to control it. Ayane feels severely inferior to her sister, but will she be able to prove herself against the other \"Ghost\" bearers in combat?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
