## Sinopse

Ume Daidouji is determined to make lots of new friends after starting high school in a new town, but her first day at school doesn't go so well. After school, she starts a new part time job at an ice-cream shop. While distributing flyers and worrying about her new life she is hit on by some sleazy men.

The knight in shining armour who saves Ume is a young primary school aged girl called Momo.

This is the beginning of their friendship, at least until Momo confesses her love for Ume...
