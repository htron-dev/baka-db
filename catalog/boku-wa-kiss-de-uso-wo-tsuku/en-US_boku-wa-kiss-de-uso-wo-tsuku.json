    "sinopse": "Meiko falls asleep in the library one day, only to be awakened by a kiss! She is unsure of who it was that kissed her, however, since there are multiple boys still in the library. Could it be the popular boy Shinoda-senpai? Or the super-cool Mikoshiba-senpai? The boy-next-door type Mogami? Or the cute underclassman Hachiya? Who could it be? They're all possible candidates, but which one does Meiko like the best...?\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Soprano\nVolume 2: Anna no Kami ga Nagai Wake, Hakka Drops",
