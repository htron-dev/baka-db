## Sinopse

When Kazura Enomoto’s grandfather dies, he leaves her to the son of a rich family, Mizuki Magahara, as payment for his debts. After she goes to live with him, Kazura learns that she’s not going to be working off the debts as a servant—she’s going to be Mizuki’s fiancée! Unless Kazura can repay her debt, she’s got no choice but to learn to live with her new lot in life. But no sooner has Kazura begun to adjust to living with Mizuki and going to his snotty rich school than the dark secret of the Magahara family comes to light. The head of the family has the unique power to bring back the souls of the dead—and right now the head of the family is Mizuki!
