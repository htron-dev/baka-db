    "sinopse": "It's just another normal day at a maid caf√© until one of the customers turn out to be a zombie! Disrupting business and infecting some of the maids, everything suddenly descends into chaos as people are attacked. As one of the more experienced maids comes to deal with the unruly customer and newly-made zombie maids, perhaps there's a bright side to this unbelievable turn of events after all?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
