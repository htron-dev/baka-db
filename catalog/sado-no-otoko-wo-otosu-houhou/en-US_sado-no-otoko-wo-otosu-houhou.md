## Sinopse

Honma Shouta was born from the Sado region. Due to his parents' death, he dropped out of his university to take care of his younger brother. Amidst the new, tough lifestyle, he met the famous architect, Sakagami Tetsuaki. In order to raise money to live, he accepted a sex proposal of "50 thousand yen a pop." He may seem a bit mean during sex, but he's been showing his kind, familial side outside of their sex life. What's next for Shouta, who seems to be falling for him...?! (Credit: Unmei No Chance)
