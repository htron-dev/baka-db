Amidst the new, tough lifestyle, he met the famous architect, Sakagami Tetsuaki. In order to raise money to live, he accepted a sex proposal of \"50 thousand yen a pop.\" He may seem a bit mean during sex, but he's been showing his kind, familial side outside of their sex life. What's next for Shouta, who seems to be falling for him...?! (Credit: Unmei No Chance)",
