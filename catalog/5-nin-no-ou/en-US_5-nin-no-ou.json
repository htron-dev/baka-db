Seiji, who has no relatives except his young sister who carries a godly power of reading the stars, agrees to devote himself to the arrogant and ruthless Blue King, Azure. However, by chance he meets the gentle and caring Red King Gules, is healed by his gentleness and then slowly falls in love with him.\n\nBut the Blue King does not forgive Seiji's thoughts, who is still his property, and as if to ridicule him Azure starts toying with his emotions.\n\n(Source: Frontier Works, translated)",
