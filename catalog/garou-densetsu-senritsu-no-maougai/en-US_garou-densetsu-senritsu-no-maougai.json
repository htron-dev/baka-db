To his shock, the rumors are true and the demons' overlord is the formerly deceased Geese. Using his troop of seven demon lords, he imprisons the younger brother and hopes to make him one of minions. Worried about his brother's absence, Terry teams up with Joe, Mai, and Big Bear to battle the undead forces and rescue Andy.\n\n(Source: SNK Wikia)",
