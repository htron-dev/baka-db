A spin-off of the movie with completely original storyline.

In the aftermath of a devastating world war, Deunan Knute and Briareos are scraping by a living as mercenaries in a ruined New York City. Deunan dreams of finding the technological utopia known as Olympus, though Briareos isn't so sure it exists. They soon cross paths with a mysterious girl and her cyborg bodyguard who claim to be on an important mission for Olympus and that they are fleeing a team of highly advanced cyborg mercenaries who will stop at nothing to ensure that they fail.
