## Sinopse

Rina, a company slave, reincarnated as the villainess Ekaterina of the prestigious duke family. Because of the unfortunate setting of the villain brothers and sisters that I did not know in the game, and because of the most recommended (non-capture target) brother Alexei, everyone will be happy!
