## Sinopse

A tragic loss. The endless despair that accompanies losing a loved one. A mysterious girl who appears at just the right moment. An unbelievable offer. "I can bring your lost loved one back to life, if you complete a simple task for me. Please kill three people, any three people, in the next 24 hours. Do that, and without fail I will revive them just as they were." Could YOU take three lives to bring someone you love back from the dead? What value do you place on human life?
