In a not-so-distant future Japan, the popularity of maid cafés have skyrocketed, and maids are revered as national idols. Battles are fought between the maid cafés to determine which one is the best at serving their masters, and they are all aspiring to be like the supreme maid and waitress (which is an anime character), Minori-chan!

However, it seems that the secret behind Minori-chan and her uniform is...?
