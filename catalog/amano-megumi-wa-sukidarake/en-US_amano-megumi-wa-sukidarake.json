That is, until his childhood friend, Amano Megumi, who goes to the same school, starts to distract him. He only saw her as the tomboy she was as a kid until they meet up again when she has become \"more developed.\" As the two get closer to each other, Manabu gets more and more distracted from his goal of getting into Tokyo U, so hilarity ensues.",
