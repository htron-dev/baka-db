Suddenly, he then finds himself roommates with his perfect, ideal handyman type, a man called Arihara. Imagining more and more indecent things, after a war with himself, Satou eventually comes to accept the romantic feelings in his heart. A BL story about complicated fudashi tendencies, with slightly tortured and realistic characters. _heart_ Also, this compilation includes a pure love story of a librarian with glasses and a flashy high school boy!!\n\n(Source: Nakama)",
