## Sinopse

Thirteen years ago a disaster occurred. Out of nowhere, a meteorite fell from the sky, and that's when everything started. First of all, there is said to be numerous people who vanished when the meteorite fell. Afterwards, according to certain reports, this was known as "spirited away."

At the same time, strange things happened. The sky filled with clouds, and a red mist shrouded the streets. And those terrible monsters had started to appear. A monster, in other words, a slave beast, one who has sold his soul to the evil king.

However, we must not despair, they have returned from the depths of the red hell, and in order to defeat the impending disaster they carry with them a gift in their hands.

"They have returned, the ones who posses the flash have returned to tear apart the fear."
