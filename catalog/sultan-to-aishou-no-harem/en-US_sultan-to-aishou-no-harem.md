## Sinopse

The whole time he was seeing Jacqui, Sultan Asim had been meeting with potential princesses!

Jacqui, a magazine writer, met Asim, a sultan, in his country when she visited Jazeer. They met in the harem, which had gone unused for a long time. The extremely confident Asim looked at Jacqui with great interest—their personalities were complete opposites and he was fascinated by her. It didn't take long for Jacqui to be entirely captivated by Asim's charm, either. She was filled with happiness when Asim made love to her...until she learned that the king had been meeting with a number of potential princesses...
