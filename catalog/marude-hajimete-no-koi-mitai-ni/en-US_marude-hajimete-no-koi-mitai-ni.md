## Sinopse

Kouno, a safe salesman with a bad case of stage fright, is on the verge of losing his job if he can't make a deal worth one million yen in the next the three days. After a shift full of nerves and disappointment, a forbidding looking man drags him into his house, plies him with coffee, and takes him out on a date! What on earth is going on?
