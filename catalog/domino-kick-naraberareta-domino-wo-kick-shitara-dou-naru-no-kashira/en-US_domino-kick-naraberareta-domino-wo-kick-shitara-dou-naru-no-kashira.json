Her impulses range from shouting out obscene words during exams to drawing a picture of feces for her school art homework. Every time, Himemori is there to be the buffer between Sae and her unquenchable thirst for chaos.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Domino Kick (pilot)",
