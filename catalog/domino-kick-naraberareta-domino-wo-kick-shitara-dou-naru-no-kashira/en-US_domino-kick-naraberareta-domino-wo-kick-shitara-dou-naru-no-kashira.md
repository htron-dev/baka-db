## Sinopse

Follow the life of Ms. Sae as she fights her catastrophic impulses to break the solemn mood of serious situations and her butler, Himemori, who will sacrifice himself in order to protect Sae from herself. Her impulses range from shouting out obscene words during exams to drawing a picture of feces for her school art homework. Every time, Himemori is there to be the buffer between Sae and her unquenchable thirst for chaos.
