## Sinopse

A series of short stories in Kago Shintaro's bizarre but innovative style. A race with dying patients on stretchers; a man finds out that everything around him is a part of a Hollywood conspiracy; a manga artist as seen by his own characters; a man creates a business of crushing mosquitoes on human skin; and many more.
