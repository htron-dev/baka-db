    "sinopse": "In a parallel world where sexism is king, young girls do not live... They survive.\n\nHaru Koyama, an average high school student, sees her life turn upside down following a violent accident. It's only when she opens her eyes that she realizes that she is no longer at home. She is now thrown into another world governed by a patriarchal system. Having no particular stats, the young girl finds herself having to work at Blue Cat Nocturne, a bar, also known for being a brothel where everyone can fulfill their greatest fantasies...\n\n(Source: Meian, translated)",
