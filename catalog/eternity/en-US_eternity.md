## Sinopse

In the year 184, three leaders (Yoobe, Kwanoo, and Jangbe) rose up against the oppressive Chinese government and were all killed. Now, a 17-year-old shaman by the name of Aram Ko is in search of the reincarnations of the three men. Back in the year 184, Kwanoo had saved a man's life and, in return, that man ensured that every one of Kwanoo's female descendents became a Shaman so that they could serve Kwanoo when he is reincarnated.
