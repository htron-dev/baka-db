Ambassadors of the gods on Earth, they shine to their people and seem at first glance like the perfect couple. However, under her mask of a perfect wife, Hatchepsout hides a deep rage... She doesn't want to just be queen, but to become the pharaoh, like her father!\n\nAs a child, she humiliated Sethi in sword combat, and nobody can beat her in shooting arrow. Why can't she achieve the greatest rank, just for being born a woman? Hatchepsout will start a war against the traditions of one of the most splendorous cultures in the world!\n\n(Source: Manga-News)",
