    "sinopse": "The story of Jeanne d'Arc, the maid of Orleans adding some original characters and events with violence and black magic. Jeanne d'Arc was a 17-year-old peasant girl who was totally unschooled in the strategies of war. Devoutly religious, she had seen visions and heard heavenly voices that told her to go to the dauphin, lead his troops to victory, free France of her enemies and see him crowned king in the great cathedral at Rheims. She was opposed by officials and she was forced to travel across France through enemy territory but so great was her consecration that it enabled her to reach the dauphin, to win belief in her mission, and to ride in shining armor beneath the golden lilied banner as the leader of the armies of France. The author introduces two original characters in the story, Pierre, a young shepherd who loves Jeanne since they were children and William, an english spy who Jeanne falls in love with.\n\n(Source: Stage Storm)",
