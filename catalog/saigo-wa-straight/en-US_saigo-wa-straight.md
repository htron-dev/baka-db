## Sinopse

The story of Takatsu Mutsuki, a scholarship student at a prestigious academy who seemingly has no talent at all. He spends his days skipping classes and playing games until he meets Mizoguchi Taiga, who transferred in to play baseball. Taiga realizes that Mutsuki's face and pitching form are identical to rival's and forces Mutsuki to become a pitcher. With the help of Mutsuki's sister Kanna, they gather nine members and form a baseball team that goes on to have all kinds of adventures.
