    "sinopse": "High school student Toudou, a handsome, womanizer who always gets the girl he aims for, ended up making a bet with his bad-boy friends about getting Miura, the school nurse, who’s a good-looking man who might be gay. Toudou will make up any excuse to shorten the distance between him and the one in the school infirmary. When Toudou finally tried to lay a seductive kiss, Miura’s usually quiet and gentle expression changed completely, and the nurse changed the kiss to a bold and deep one!?\n\n(Source: MU)",
