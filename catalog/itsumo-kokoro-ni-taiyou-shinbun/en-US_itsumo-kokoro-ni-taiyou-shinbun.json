    "sinopse": "Takayama Kobato works in the advertising department of the Taiyou Newspaper. She is typcially calm but is a little weird and has a thing for older men. Her co-workers are Sakuragi Yuu, a beautiful woman who is really sensitive about her age and her lack of relationships with men, and Yukiya Asagi, who is young and cute but is known for her rude comments. This manga tells the comedic story of these three women in the workplace and the events around their daily lifes.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
