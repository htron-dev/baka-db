## Sinopse

In 1916, in Fukagawa-ku, Tokyo, there was a cheerful young man, Keisuke Hanamori, and Yoshifumi Shirakiku, who had an unappealing beauty. Hanamori, who is working as a part-time worker at the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, is taken to the Director General of the Horticultural Research Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. So he was told about a fairytale-like incident... It is a Taishou Noir detective story made by two diametrically opposite men.
