## Sinopse

The royal palace of the kingdom of Alba Forest received one letter of advance notice. That is, "We shall take the last treasure left behind by the late king to his beloved daughter, Violet." The sender of that letter was a group of robbers called the "Three Beasts." When Violet meets one of them by chance, the crow, her life changes greatly...!
