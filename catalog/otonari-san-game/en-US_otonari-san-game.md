## Sinopse

Tsuruoka Maiko and Sasano Keisuke are childhood friends and just entered high school. Their families are neighbors and have been living next to each other for well over a decade. They've been getting along well ever since they've met, but recently there seems to be a divide between them. What could be the reason?
