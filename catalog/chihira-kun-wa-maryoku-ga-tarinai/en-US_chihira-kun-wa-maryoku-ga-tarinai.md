## Sinopse

Chihira is an ordinary boy looking to lose his innocence. One day, his "succubus blood" awakens, which means he now needs to steal other men's vitality in order to survive. He desperately asks his best friend Arou for help... Wait! He wanted to take someone for the first time but now he's being taken?!

What is an ordinary high school student to do when he suddenly becomes a succubus?! A rom-com featuring a taciturn airhead and a cheerful dunce.
