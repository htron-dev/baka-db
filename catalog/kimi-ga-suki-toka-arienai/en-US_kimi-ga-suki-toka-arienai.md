## Sinopse

Kana, who has zero experience with love and can't even talk to a boy, loves to read about it in her favorite manga, which according to her friends is completely unrealistic. Annoyed by their cynicism, Kana declares that she will finally get herself a boyfriend and prove them wrong. Suddenly, a handsome transfer student arrives. Is this love at first sight? Does she have a chance with this popular boy? Why does he seem to know so much about her?
