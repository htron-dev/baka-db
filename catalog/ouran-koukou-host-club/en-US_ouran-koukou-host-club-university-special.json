    "sinopse": "July 2011 Special\nWhen Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin bail on being models for an upcoming fashion show, Mei Yasumura finds herself scrambling through last-minute replacements. Unfortunately for her, the Hitachiin twins have already sent in their substitute: Ritsu Kasanoda. With all options exhausted and time running out, Mei resolves to train a vexed Kasanoda to become her model.\n\nAugust 2011 Special\nOn a hot midsummer night, a few of the Ouran Host Club members begin to share ghost stories to each other. Soon, they are interrupted by a tardy Takashi Morinozuka, who claims to have seen an apparition. Upon arriving at the location of the sighting, the group is surprised to see that the ghost looks similar to Kyouya Ootori—who is very much alive. As they try to identify the mysterious figure, the club encounters a child with a wish to attend a festival.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
