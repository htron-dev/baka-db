## Sinopse

Gordon is an unsociable middle-aged man driving his food truck through a world buried in sand. One day, he meets a girl named Arisa sleeping stark naked in the middle of the desert. While Arisa wolfs down any and all food she can fit in her mouth, a mysterious armed group seems to be pursuing her, too.
