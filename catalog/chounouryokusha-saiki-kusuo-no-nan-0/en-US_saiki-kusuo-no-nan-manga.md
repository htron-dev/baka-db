## Sinopse

Kusuo Saiki is not your typical high schooler—behind his glasses, pink hair, and antenna-like appendages exists a being of unfathomable psychic power. Telekinesis, teleportation, and astral projection might sound exciting to the average person, but from Saiki's viewpoint, they are nothing but an annoyance. Psychic powers are unnecessary—this is all that Saiki has believed since he was a kid.

As a secret esper with the sole dream of living an ordinary life, Saiki tries to use his psychic abilities to stay out of the public's gaze. However, having to clean up after his odd classmates and their antics, all the while keeping his psychic powers a secret, makes it rather difficult to achieve the peaceful life he desires.
