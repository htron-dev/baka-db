## Sinopse

Touya Asayama, a registered dietician, is suddenly sent to another world with his little sister Momoka. They stumble across a restaurant specializing in healthy food, but it ends up that the people of this world believe that food can't be healthy and taste good at the same time. Armed with his knowledge as a dietician, Touya begins working at the restaurant in hopes of changing the world's view of food and healthy eating.
