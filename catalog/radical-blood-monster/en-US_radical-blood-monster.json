Despite having the chance to escape, he lingered to gain writers experience, and ended up getting stabbed. During his last breath, a strange guy appeared claiming it was fate. A few hours later he awakens and finds himself sleeping naked next to that strange guy. Then that strange guy tells him that his blood is \"S-Class\" and that he's going to be Yuichi's lifetime \"partner\". Will the pragmatic novelist be able to wrap his mind around all this...?!\n\n(Source: Girls' Generation Scanlations)",
