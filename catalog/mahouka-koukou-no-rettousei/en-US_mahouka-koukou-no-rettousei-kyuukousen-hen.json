    "sinopse": "Manga adaptation of the 2nd arc of the Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei series.\n\nThere are currently nine magic high schools affiliated with the National University of Magic throughout the country. In an effort to address the current limitations, magic high schools are trained to the highest degree, while they are trying to increase the limited pool of instructors.\n\nFor that purpose, a measure was put in place so as to fuel the student's aspirations through competitions between the 9 magic schools. The largest of these is the summer Nine Schools Competition. It is a nationwide magic high school magic tournament.\n\nEvery year a selection of magic high school students from across the country meet, putting their pride on the line, and unfold a story of frustration and glory. With a huge crowd including not only government officials and those interested in magic but also businesses, overseas companies, researchers and scouts, this is the greatest stage for magic high school students to shine.\n\nThis year too, the curtains of that momentous event will be raised again.",
