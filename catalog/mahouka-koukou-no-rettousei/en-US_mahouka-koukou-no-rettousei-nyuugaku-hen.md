## Sinopse

Manga adaptation of the 1st arc of the Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei series.

"Magic" is a product of neither legends nor fairy tales. It has become a technology of reality for nearly a century. Various countries in the world are locked in a race in nurturing "Magicians."

What will happen to him, and how will he live his school life where he is one of the many reserves in the school looked down upon by the chosen magical students?
