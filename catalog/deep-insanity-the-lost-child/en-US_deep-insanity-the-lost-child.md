## Sinopse

Madness and unawakening sleep, Randolph syndrome.

This new illness is slowly but steadily approaching humanity, caused by the huge underground world Asylum that appeared in Antarctica. There are strange creatures different from the earth, and unknown resources. People bet their lives on the depths of the mysterious new world to get huge wealth, organizational plots, or their own ambitions.

And here alone, a young man with a wish in his heart is trying to challenge the front line of Asylum.
