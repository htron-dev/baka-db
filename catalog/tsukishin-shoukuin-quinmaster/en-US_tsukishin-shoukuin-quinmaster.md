## Sinopse

High school girl Ibuki Wakaba yearns to be a tokusatsu hero, just like on TV. While daydreaming on the school roof she runs into real monsters and is saved by Ririe, warrior from another dimension sent to protect her.

Note: Appears to be an older short series by Kotetsu Akane that was not collected into volumes until Tubame Syndrome became popular
