In the company of her faithful bat friend, Sen, Kuro encounters all manners of people and places which fire the reader's imagination. Told in 4-koma style with beautifully rendered art, Hitsugikatsugi no Kuro. is a manga that manages both dark and gothic and irresistibly endearing on just about every page!",
