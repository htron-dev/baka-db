## Sinopse

"I'm the smallest person in our grade... but love came for me, too!"

Hina's very petite, but her first love confession ever comes from the tough-looking Akitaka, who happens to be the tallest guy in their grade. Hina is overjoyed to get her first boyfriend, but at the same time, she's overwhelmed... What do lovers do? That means... k-kissing, right? The couple decides to experience their firsts at their own pace, but many trials await them! And amidst all that, Akitaka reaches for Hina in a sudden outburst of desire...!
