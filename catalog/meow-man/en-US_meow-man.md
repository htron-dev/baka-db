## Sinopse

What if your dream date turns out to be... a cat? Such is the dilemma for Bonnie, a young woman who wanted love and ended up with Claude, a highly needy half-man-half-cat instead. Will they be able to make it work? Is sharing the litterbox going to be a huge problem? And what are her friends going to think? Read Meow Man to see how this big ball of yarn unfurls.
