## Sinopse

If you thought the SOS Brigade's adventures couldn't get any more outrageous...you've never met Haruhi-chan! Nagato has gone otaku! Asakura is her pint-size prisoner/plaything! Mikuru's so cute she turns into a sheep!

You'll find plenty of gags and guffaws as Haruhi dives into the world of four-panel and short comics.
