The countries and brigades (parties) all over the world are searching for the location of its whereabouts; the age to fight for the Encore. The boy called Ren who wants to become a knight has no talent in wielding swords despite looking exactly like the Elline the Brave Hero, he has been having a lifestyle where people taunts him as the \"Fake Brave Hero.\" The one that appears in front of him is the legendary Dragon Princess Krische, who had waked up from her seal.
