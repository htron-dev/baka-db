## Sinopse

Masataka takes care of a shrine which houses the 12 spirit animals of the Chinese zodiac. One day he gets a surprising visitor, a young man named Kotarou, who is possessed by the cat spirit, Koma. Their own shrine having been burned down, Kotarou now searches for a new place and ends up on Masataka's doorstep.
