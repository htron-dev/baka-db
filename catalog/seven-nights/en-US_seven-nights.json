    "sinopse": "I, Sakuya Hoshi, am just a normal high school student who attends to Suijou Academy.\n\nBut for some reason, every night I was being 'called' by a 'creepy' dream. In the dream is a town of never ending night. No sign of people there besides me; instead of people there are 'monsters'. That's the kind of dangerous world it is.\n\nWith the girl I met in my dream, Akeno Gasukamori, we try to find a way to somehow escape this endless nightmare...\n\nWill we ever safely get out of this endless nightmare, with monsters after us and other repeating horrors... And exactly what or who awaits us in the end...?!\n\n(Source: MU)",
