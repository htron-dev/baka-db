    "sinopse": "The fabric of life twists, turns, comes together in strange shapes, splits and transforms, and reunites again. In one cord of that rich tapestry, Tokyo boy Taki Tachibana and rural Itomori girl Mitsuha Miyamizu wake up in each other's bodies as if they were dreaming of another life. While the phenomenon persists, the two 17-year-olds adapt to each other's lifestyle as they try to figure a way out of the situation.\n\nHowever, it is not just the two teenagers who have to deal with the unusual state of affairs. In particular, Mitsuha's friends and family find the girl's unusual behavior hard to fathom. To her friends, sister, grandmother, and even stray father, her brash conduct feels curiously celestial.\n\nWhen a meteor shower colors the night sky crimson during Itomori's autumn festival, a long-forgotten piece of the town's history is revealed, unraveling the entangled threads of fate.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
