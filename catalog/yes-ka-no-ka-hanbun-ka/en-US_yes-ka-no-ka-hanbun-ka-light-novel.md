## Sinopse

Kunieda Kei is a popular TV announcer known for being a cool and flawless professional. But on the inside, he’s the opposite: brash, hot-tempered, and as prickly as can be. Still, Kei juggles his private and professional personas successfully until one day, the unthinkable happens: stop-motion animator Tsuzuki Ushio from work sees him at the grocery store with his real personality on display! Now Kei has to figure out how to navigate a relationship he didn’t expect. But is that really as scary as the possibility that someone might love both sides of him?
