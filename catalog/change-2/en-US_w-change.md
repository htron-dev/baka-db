High-school student Kisaragi Maki has one dream: to be a normal wife. She’s part of a Yakuza family known as Group Kisaragi and her father is the third generation of the group - and he wants Maki to be the fourth generation! But Maki isn’t a ‘normal high school student’. She has a split personality which gets her into all sorts of trouble. Can Maki achieve her dream of being a ‘normal wife’?
