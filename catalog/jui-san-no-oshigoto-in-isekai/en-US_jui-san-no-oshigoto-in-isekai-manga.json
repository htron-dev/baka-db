    "sinopse": "Kazami Shingo was summoned into another world. The purpose for that summoning was \"to make the territory more prosperous.\" To sum it up, it's a typical \"summoned into another world thingy\"—is what Kazami thought at the time.\n\n\"But, I'm only a mere veterinarian.\"\n\nHowever, never underestimate a fantasy world. This world has dragons, monsters, and many other races. The difference of language, magic, food, religion, common sense and many other aspects different from the Earth are endless.\n\nEven so, the veterinarian becomes a public servant and for the time being performing autopsies, medicine making, and improving agriculture.\n\nNot as a hero, not as a doctor, but as a veterinarian, and this is the story of how he do his best in making this another world as his new house.\n\n(Source: Novel Updates, edited)",
