    "sinopse": "Hina Mizuki is a girl who never liked learning, and her test scores are naturally at the bottom of the class. Even most of the tutors don't really know what to do with her. One day a young handsome tutor named Sakuya Ichijou came. His ways of teaching are different; When Mizuki is learning from him, learning felt just like talking to a friend. Mizuki also had developed a secret love for Sakuya that she is trying her best to hide. Could Mizuki possibly have the power to change her test scores?\n\n(Source: LiVelY sCaNs)",
