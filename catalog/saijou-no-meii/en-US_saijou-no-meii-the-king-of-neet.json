    "sinopse": "This is a sequel to Saijou no Meii. Dr. Mogami currently has two major problems on his mind. The first is that the young, genius surgeon from the previous series, Saijou Mikoto, has fallen terribly ill. The second is his delinquent, shut-in son, Yoshiaki. He just knows that Yoshiaki has a lot of potential, but he's failed at raising him. Yoshiaki is nothing but a lazy, arrogant, spoiled brat.\n\nAfter Dr. Mogami kicks him out of the house, in hopes that it will do him good, Yoshiaki crashes with his childhood friend Date Masamune. Date is also something of a punk, but, to Yoshiaki's surprise, he's decided to try to study to become a doctor. The combined efforts of Date and his father slowly nudge him back on track. After a near-tragic occurrence, Yoshiaki even begins to think that maybe he should become a doctor, too!\n\n(Source: MU)",
