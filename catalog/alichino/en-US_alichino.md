## Sinopse

Beautiful creatures called 'Alichino' grant any wish to those who find them--but at a price!

A young lady searching for an Alichino wants to bring her brother back to life. She meets Tsugiri, a handsome young man who she thinks is an Alichino. While Tsugiri turns out to be a mere mortal, he does have a mysterious connection with these rare creatures--a connection that brings him and those around him grave danger!
