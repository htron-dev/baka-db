## Sinopse

Izumo Kunisaki, a descendant of Izumo no Okuni, is often mistaken as a girl. It is the bane of his existence. His father and best-friend (i.e. the girl he likes) often laugh about it. To top it off, he plays the girl roles in his family's Kabuki troupe. In this short, he discovers that that curse is also his greatest source strength and will prove just how much of a man he is.
