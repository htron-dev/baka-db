## Sinopse

The criminal is a witch. The trick is magic.
In the middle of a festival, a girl disappeared into a sea of flames. This was in a locked room under the sight of many and furthermore, it was an imitation of a thousand year old legend. Rookie knight Werner and Witch Hunter Ludovika challenge this incident. However the two of them were not aware --of the long history that lays behind the incident.
And to make matters worse, they are hindered by the inquisitor Ersilia.
The two old friends, as well as natural enemies are bound by a certain tragedy--
The girls' obstacles, an incident made up of magic, a mystery that has been left unsolved for a thousand years. And when lies are brought to light, the boy will find true justice.
