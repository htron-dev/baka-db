    "sinopse": "The criminal is a witch. The trick is magic.\nIn the middle of a festival, a girl disappeared into a sea of flames. This was in a locked room under the sight of many and furthermore, it was an imitation of a thousand year old legend. Rookie knight Werner and Witch Hunter Ludovika challenge this incident. However the two of them were not aware --of the long history that lays behind the incident.\nAnd to make matters worse, they are hindered by the inquisitor Ersilia.\nThe two old friends, as well as natural enemies are bound by a certain tragedy--\nThe girls' obstacles, an incident made up of magic, a mystery that has been left unsolved for a thousand years. And when lies are brought to light, the boy will find true justice.\n\n(Source: Amazon, translated)",
