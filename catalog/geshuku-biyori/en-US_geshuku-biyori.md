## Sinopse

"Kindly move out within 6 months." Masachika Fujimaki, the new apartment manager, makes this sudden declaration to the tenants of Wisteria Manor. Having lived there for so long without incident, “shock” doesn't begin to describe how the tenants feel. To top it all off, the cool and always aloof Masachika turns out to be (of all things) gay. Though he’d always thought himself to be straight, tenant Kei Kuraya finds himself attracted to Masachika. Discover the heart-warming story of men from all walks of life living happily together.
