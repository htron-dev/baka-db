## Sinopse

Three episodes aired on TV as part of the Ribon x Oha Suta specials.

Akane: She's beautiful and popular, lively and full of vitality; Aoi: Looks like a small animal but is actually very clever. Who knew that these two very different people were actually... twin siblings?!

Note: Episodes were made available on the official stream few days before the official broadcast.
