    "sinopse": "After their victory over Shitenhouji Middle School in the semifinals, Ryouma Echizen and the Seishun Academy Boys Tennis Team must now face off against the two-time defending champions of Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School in order to claim the national title. Rikkai is not only seeking revenge for its team's previous loss to Seishun at the Kanto Regional Tournament, but they also are aiming to win the national title for a third consecutive year.\n\nIn the conclusion of Tennis no Ouji-sama, the titular \"Prince of Tennis\" is pitted against the \"Child of God\" in a head-to-head battle for the national championship title. Along the way, Ryouma must teach his opponents and teammates that there is more to tennis than winning.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
