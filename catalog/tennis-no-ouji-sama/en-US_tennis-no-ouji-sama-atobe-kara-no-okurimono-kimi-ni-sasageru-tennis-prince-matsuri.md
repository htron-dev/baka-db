## Sinopse

Hyoutei Academy's excessively wealthy and prideful tennis captain, Keigo Atobe, decides to host a giant one-day inter-school festival in order to bring together the middle school tennis circuit. The festival exudes class and wealth, befitting its host. The extravagant occasion is filled with many attractions, with the most major event being a fierce relay race between all of the schools in attendance. However, Atobe has his own reasons for hosting this Super Tennis Festival; it seems that the special day is all for a certain someone among the festival attendees.
