## Sinopse

What exactly do middle and high school tennis players do after classes end for the day? Surprisingly, it's not always playing tennis. From enjoying the seasons to discovering unconventional training techniques, there are more to these enthusiastic athletes outside the sport. In this 4-koma after-school comedy, Ryouma Echizen and his friends stumble upon whimsical situations in which the laughter never stops!
