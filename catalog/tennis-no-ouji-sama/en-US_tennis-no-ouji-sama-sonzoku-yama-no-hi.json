    "sinopse": "Echizen and the Seigaku regulars took a day off of their normal routines and went hiking on a mountain, where a tennis resort awaits their arrival. Expecting to do some special training, the team reaches the destination only to find their precious tennis courts taken over by a group of college tennis players. However, Ryoma is more than happy to teach them a thing or two about how to play \"real\" tennis.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
