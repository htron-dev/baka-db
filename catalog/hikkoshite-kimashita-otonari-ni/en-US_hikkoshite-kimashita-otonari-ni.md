## Sinopse

Takumi Kusunose is a man who loves the company of others and simply cannot abide being by himself. When he took responsibility for his company's losses by paying out of his own pocket, it nearly broke him. As a result, he was forced to move into a cheap apartment, but what happens when the sexy blonde guy next door begins making sexual advances at Takumi...?! And what happens when Takumi's former secretary shows up, turning Takumi and his neighbor's potential relationship into a love triangle?!
