## Sinopse

Kazumasa is on the baseball team in his middle school in Komae (a city in Tokyo), but he's hardly an ace player. He's something of an otaku, and he isn't all that concerned that he's not the top—his dream is to become a sports journalist. This year, everyone knows the team captainship is between the great players Namikawa and Yokosuka. However, the faculty advisor of the baseball club decides this year to choose a captain instead of taking a vote from the players. Based on a desire to involve Kazumasa more in the team (due in large part to a visit from Kazumasa's mother), he chooses Kazumasa as the captain. The other players are shocked and disappointed, but Kazumasa doesn't want to refuse the captainship and quit the club. Will he be able to rise to the challenge?
