## Sinopse

Viscount Adam Canning possesses unrivaled good looks as well as a reputation for seducing countless men and women. He is appointed as the bodyguard of Lorraine's Minister of Justice, Montague, who is constantly under threat due to his rivalry with the Church. Adam is less than thrilled to shoulder this responsibility, until he meets Sir Montague's straight-laced nephew Joel and immediately falls for him. However, when Adam attempts to court him, he is only met with numerous refusals.

In the midst of a crisis related to religion, politics, and conspiracy, how will the relationship between Adam and Joel develop?
