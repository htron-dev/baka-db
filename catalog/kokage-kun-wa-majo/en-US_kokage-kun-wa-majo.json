    "sinopse": "Yumeko, a daydreaming high school girl, lives with her family in one of the apartments in a rundown and scarcely populated housing complex. The person who manages the housing complex, Kokage-kun, a hikikomori, lives on the rooftop of the building, and he happens to be a witch.\n\nYumeko often asks Kokage-kun to use his magic to help her whenever she has any kind of selfish wish. For example, when her crush, a heart throb senpai from school, suddenly notices her and asks her out on a date.\n\n(Source: MU)",
