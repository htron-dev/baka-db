## Sinopse

Yuuichi Tachibana, who lost both of his parents and sister in a traffic accident, took in his seven year old nephew, Ayumu. To create a new life, he moves them to the city where the sea can be seen, so they can focus only on themselves. They meet Ryou Kurebayashi who runs the local souzaiya. Even though he is the same age as Yuuichi, he is a popular person who has his own shop and is loved by the neighborhood. Taking things day by day, will these three be able to overcome the lingering fears from their pasts?
