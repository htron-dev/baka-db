## Sinopse

Yuzu is only 11 years old, but she's got a lot on her plate. When her mom gets sick, Yuzu goes to live with her Uncle Akihito, who runs the local animal hospital. She's super scared of animals, but she'll do her best to help out!

Through many tough moments, like her mother's illness and standing up to bullies, Yuzu learns big lessons about what it means to care. And with some help from her animal pals, friends, and kind grown-ups, Yuzu's ready to take on the day!
