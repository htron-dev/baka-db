## Sinopse

In 1982, 30 years ago, I failed my high school entrance exam at the peak of my youth, and was a so-called "chuurou." I lived as a chuurou when I was 15, the most impressionable time of my life. For most ordinary people, that year would be considered a negative. And yet, that one year made me who I am now. Speaking of which, am I happy now? The 2013 me will meet the 1982 me once more.
