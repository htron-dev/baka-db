## Sinopse

Don’t mess with Ayu; she’s one of the top-ranked Karate club members in the region, although she does have one weakness; snakes. After one fight where she is unconscious because her opponent knows her weakness, and old friend shows up, a young man named Shunpei. He used to be a weakling, but now he may be even stronger than Ayu!
