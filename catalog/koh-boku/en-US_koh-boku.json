    "sinopse": "From good morning to good night, working like a horse, aiming for the betterment of Japan's tomorrow... that is the duty of a civil servant (Koh-Boku), a public official of Kasumigaseki. One such Koh-Boku, Kyuu-san, has Kashiwagi by his side, a super-elite who is a dozen years his junior. Even though he thinks that he really should push his junior to stand on his own, he couldn't bear to be parted from the pleasure of working passionately every day with Kashiwagi... but one day, their cozy relationship changed...?!\n\n(Source: Shinshokan, translated)",
