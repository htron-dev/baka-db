    "sinopse": "Brothers Conflict Short Stories is a compilation of all the short stories that were previously featured on Sylph and Dengeki Girl’s Style. This book contains unusual interactions between the characters who didn’t usually talk to each other, like Azusa and Iori, Subaru and Rui, or even Ukyou and Natsume. The short story about the triplets’ school life—\"Early Days\"—is also included here.\n\n(Source: Love-colored Sky)",
