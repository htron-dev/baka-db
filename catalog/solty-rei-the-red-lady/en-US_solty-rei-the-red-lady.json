    "sinopse": "In a future-based disaster-ridden city with an enormous gap between the rich and the poor, it is hard to tell which humans are walking around with cybernetic body parts. This makes Roy Revant's job as a renegade bounty hunter/bodyguard-for-hire even more difficult. When a young girl with unbeliveable strength rescues him from a particularly dangerous criminal, Roy realizes that perhaps help can be found in the strangest of places. Joining together with a few others, they engage in a battle to find out the truth behind the giant conglomerates that are supposedly serving mankind and making life better.\nSolty, an android who has lost her memory, has escaped and is being hunted by the RUC Security Bureau. She encounters a bounty hunter named Roy who adopts her as his daughter after being hired as a bodygaurd for Miranda\n\n(Source: MU)",
