## Sinopse

Yukimura got kicked out of home because he was the son of a mistress and his dad passed away. After going abroad to cope, he then applied for this job to be a waiter at a resort. Yukimura pictured fancy bowties, music, and trees by the poolside. However, on day one, he finds out he's working at a traditional Japanese inn with a rather cold boss. It seems that people who work at the inn have nowhere else to go...
