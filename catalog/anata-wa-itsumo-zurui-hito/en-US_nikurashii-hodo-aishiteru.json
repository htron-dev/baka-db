    "sinopse": "From an outside perspective, the relationship between Saori Fujimura and her boss Ayako Asano is purely professional. However, digging beneath the surface shows that strictly platonic rapport could not be further from the truth. After assisting her with work that she has been struggling to finish, Ayako invites Saori out for drinks at a bar. However, Saori drinks too much and lets slip the famous phrase—\"I love you.\" This leads to the two sharing a passionate night together, despite the fact that Ayako must return to her husband in the morning.\n\nAs both women grapple with the unsatisfactory nature of their current lives, they begin to explore the meaning of their own happiness and the strength it takes to grasp it.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
