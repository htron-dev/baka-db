    "sinopse": "Warrior Woman doesn't want much out of life, other than to get Hero to fall in love with her. But no matter how hard she tries to show off her feminine side, he only sees her as a fellow adventurer. Maybe that's because she's the strongest fighter alive—strong enough to slay a dragon with a single blow! Does Warrior Woman have what it takes to win Hero's heart without accidentally killing him in the process?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
