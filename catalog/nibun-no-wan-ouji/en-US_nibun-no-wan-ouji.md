## Sinopse

Takizawa Tsukiko is a slightly jaded, but otherwise average high school girl who believes that princes are only interested in princesses that are beautiful. That's how it was in all of the fairy tales she read as a little girl and that's how it must be in real life, too. Could a chance encounter with a grumpy half-human half-dog male who claims to be a prince from the strange country of Manten change this belief?
