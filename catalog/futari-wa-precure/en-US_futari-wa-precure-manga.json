    "sinopse": "Nagisa Misumi and Honoka Yukishiro couldn't be more different. Nagisa is sporty and Honoka bookish, and while they attend the same school, they have very little in common—until one day, a shower of shooting stars brings two very unlikely visitors into their lives: Mippuru and Meppuru, refugees from the Garden of Light, which has been conquered by Darkness. Endowed with new and startling powers, Nagisa and Honoka become Cure Black and Cure White, magical defenders of the light-together, they are Pretty Cure.\n\n(Source: MU)",
