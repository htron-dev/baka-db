    "sinopse": "During the summer festival five years ago, two girls met at a mysterious tree and saw two glowing spheres. Now, these two girls—Saki Hyuuga, ace pitcher on the school softball team; and Mai Mishou, who prefers sketching over stargazing—are chosen by the spirits of flowers (Flappy) and birds (Choppy) to restore the Seven Fountains and save their worlds from Dark Autumn. Together, they are the new Pretty Cure.\n\n(Source: MU)",
