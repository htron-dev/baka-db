## Sinopse

Haruka Haruno attends the Noble Academy boarding school and cherishes her dreams of becoming a princess. One day, she encounters two fairy creatures from the Hope Kingdom: Pafu and Aroma, who are followed by the monsters created by Dyspear, who wants to bring despair to the world by locking dreams away in the Gate of Desperation. The fairies give Haruka a Princess Perfume and she becomes Cure Flora. Later joined by Minami Kaidou and Kirara Amanogawa, as Cure Mermaid and Cure Twinkle, Haruka forms the Princess PreCure Team to collect Dress-Up Keys needed to open the Gate of Dreams while protecting people's dreams from Dys Dark's forces.
