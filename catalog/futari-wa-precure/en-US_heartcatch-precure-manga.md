## Sinopse

Tsubomi Hanasaki is a 2nd year middle school student who loves flowers and plants. One day, she dreams of a mysterious flowering tree that wilted, causing the sprites to disappear. When she transfers to Myodou Academy, the sprites that she saw in that dream appeared before her. The sprites begged Tsubomi to become Pretty Cure to protect the Great Tree, but she refuses. However, a sudden attack from a mysterious enemy came, and the Heart Seed of her new classmate, Erika Kurumi, is stolen. To save Erika's heart, she had no choice but to become a Pretty Cure and fight.
