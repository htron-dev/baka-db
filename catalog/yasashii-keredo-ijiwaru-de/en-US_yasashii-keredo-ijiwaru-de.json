On top of that, he then finds himself carrying the knocked-unconscious Wakasa home! Is this guy really a nice, kind homeroom teacher, or is he, in reality, someone quite naughty in more ways than one?\n\n• Bouquet for You\n(Chapters 1 & 2)\nWhen young florist Kazuki helps a customer who has allergies, he doesn't expect to see the man again. But pretty soon businessman Etou is becoming a regular part of Kazuki's life.\n\n• Unexpected Disaster\nWhen the cat he's not supposed to have gets into his next door neighbor's house and makes a mess of some valuable paintings, a young scuba instructor finds himself blackmailed into nude modeling by the perverted artist.\n\n(Source: MU)",
