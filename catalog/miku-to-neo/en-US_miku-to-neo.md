## Sinopse

Miku, a young man who had attempted suicide and lost all his memories, is found by the caretaker of the nearby Buddhist temple, Neo, who ends up taking him under his wing. At that moment, Neo discovers that Miku has a sling bag containing a huge sum of rolled-up bank notes... Until he gets back his memory, Mic becomes a freeloader at the temple, living his days without worry. However, Neo comes to discover Miku's dark past...
