## Sinopse

Nakamura Mei is a very simple high school girl. While at a cafe with her friends, they bump in to -none other than- the model Shirou's table. Mei apologizes and that's when Shirou notices something. Grabbing her he takes her outside with him and reveals that Mei was once a kids model—and that he's her idol-otaku!?
