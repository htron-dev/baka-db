## Sinopse

About a "unique" manga artist down on his luck. He finds a job where he meets another young otaku, and they manage to fall for each other. Unfortunately, she is a different kind of otaku than what he is used to. Cosplay, manga, hilarity, and some madness ensues as we follow the journey of two otakus falling in love.
