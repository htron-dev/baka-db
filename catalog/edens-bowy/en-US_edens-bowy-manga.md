## Sinopse

In a world with floating cities know as Eden, a young boy named Jorrne attempts to return to Eden to be reunited with his mother. Born with the destiny of bearing god-killing powers, he is the object of Eden's attention—both as something to study, and something to destroy. Aided by a young magic-wielding girl named Elisiss, her sister Enefeaa, and a swordsman sent from Eden, Jorrne travels to find his way home and to discover the truth behind his power.
