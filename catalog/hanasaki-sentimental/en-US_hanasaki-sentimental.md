## Sinopse

Sasaya Kae is a young girl eagerly waiting for spring to come, and on a snowy school day she meets Niina Yuito, a boy with the same sentiment in his eyes. She endeavors to get closer to Niina, but in the process finds out he has a phobia of being touched by girls. Not wanting to give up, Kae asks him to become her boyfriend, but what shocks her most is the girl named Kataoka who can casually touch Niina and whom he calls "special".
