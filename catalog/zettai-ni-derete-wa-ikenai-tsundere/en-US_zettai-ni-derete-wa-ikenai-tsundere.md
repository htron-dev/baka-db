## Sinopse

"Don't get the wrong idea, okay. I definitely don't like people such as you!"

This template tsundere phrase marked the beginning of mine and Mifuyuu Aotsuki's story. Because of her cold and indifferent attitude, she always stands out negatively in class. However one day, we ended up talking more and more with each other, and I started to see the warmth behind her cold words. Why is she so distanced and unaffectionate toward people despite being so kind? That seems to be related to her past that I don't know about...

This is a story about love, telling the coming along of a boy and girl until they finally act affectionate toward each other.
