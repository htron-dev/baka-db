    "sinopse": "Class rivals June and Lucia vie for the honor of being named the Queen of Light, entrusted with protecting the people from the King of Darkness. June is an attractive girl whose feisty, hot temper and general laziness may prevent her from receiving the crown...Lucia has a more regal quality and a strong desire to match, but she is always overshadowed by June. Will petty jealousies, love triangles, and one cute boy interfere with the Queen's royal duty?!\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
