One of these heroes is Zane, a lawyer by day and defender of justice by night. Another is Al, an attractive ladies' man. Another is Mana, a 33-year-old man who appears to be a child and who has robotic hands. Last but not least is Nisu, a cheerful girl who has the powerful ability to trap people inside of Polaroid pictures. The four of them carry on with their life together, defeat criminals, and do their best to keep their vigilante identities top secret!",
