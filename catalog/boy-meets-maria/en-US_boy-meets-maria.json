On his first day of high school, he sets eyes on \"Maria,\" the star of the drama club. Graceful, with an air of ambivalence, Maria is the apple of everyone's eyes. Taiga is quick to confess, only to find out that Maria's real name is Yuu Arima, a very much male classmate.\n\nHowever, Taiga is drawn to Arima's volatile personality, belying a past that haunts them to this very day. Regardless of gender, Taiga nevertheless wants to learn who the true \"Arima\" is.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
