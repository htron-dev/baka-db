    "sinopse": "The main character, Yuya Yoshizumi, was being pressured into paying off the debt left by his parents who had fled abroad. It was his classmate, Kaede Hitotsuba, chosen as the cutest schoolgirl in Japan, who saved him from this crisis of life and death. However, there was a catch. The condition required to fulfill in return for taking over his debt was—\"In return for the loan, you have to live with me.\"\n\n\"Why did that happen?!\"\n\nYuya's daily life collapsed on this day.\n\n\"Yuya-kun. Let's take a bath together. Yuya-kun, please be my hug pillow.\"\n\n\"That's enough, Hitotsuba-san!\"\n\nThe slapstick love comedy between the beautiful, but easy-going Kaede Hitotsuba and the serious and hard-headed Yuya Yoshizumi, starts now!\n\n(Source: Kakuyomu, translated)",
