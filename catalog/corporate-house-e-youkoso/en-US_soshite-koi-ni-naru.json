    "sinopse": "Midori had an offbeat air and a gorgeous face that gets him tons of attention…but he’s completely antisocial! His popular pal Takahiro couldn’t be more different, but behind his sweet smile, there’s something that suggests he wants more out of life than just night after night of drinking and flirting. Will these two opposites finally come together and find the words to tell each other how they truly feel?\n\n(Source: Juné)",
