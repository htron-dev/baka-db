## Sinopse

What lies below Tokyo's subway system is more frightening than you could have ever imagined...
Deep beneath Tokyo there exists a boundary between this world and the next: the land of the dead-and the mysterious young man Seiya is its guide. In this collection of bone-chilling shorts, follow the twisted tales of death and hauntings that inhabit this horrifying underworld, where innocent youth fall victim to the ghosts who lurk in Tokyo's underground.
