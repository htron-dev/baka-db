## Sinopse

Kumagae, who's only had bad rumors about him go around school since admission, becomes an isolated existence in class. For one of their lessons, Akira pairs up with Kumagae. Through this incident, something strikes a chord in Kumagae and he becomes attached to Akira. Whatever Akira says, he does. Wherever Akira goes, he goes. Kumagae's change in attitude causes a stir around them. "A really wacky guy's started liking me...!" Even so, why can't Akira leave him alone...? An attention-seeking ex-lone wolf and a soft puppy-like owner—a love story where possessiveness meets neediness!
