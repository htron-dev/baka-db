## Sinopse

The story will be set in the city of Minamisouma in Fukushima prefecture, and will center around a down-and-out protagonist who gets to know a robot while working rescue efforts. It will depict the friendship and growth of a group of children alongside the robot. Local traditional crafts such as Ouborisoumayaki pottery will appear in the story. Fukushima Gainax is producing the anime to promote Fukushima's "Innovation Coast" initiative that aims to revive industry and tourism in the region after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
