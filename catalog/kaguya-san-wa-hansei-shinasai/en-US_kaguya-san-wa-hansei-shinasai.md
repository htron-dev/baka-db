## Sinopse

Kaguya was banished to Earth for crimes on her home world. To adapt to human society, Kaguya took over the body of an unconscious high school girl and became interested in the reproductive habits of the primitive Earthlings. Now it's up to the health teacher Kato to protect the girl's body and the rest of Earth from Kaguya's tentacle powers!
