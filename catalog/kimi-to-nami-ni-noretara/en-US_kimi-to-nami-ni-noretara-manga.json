Their young romance comes to an abrupt end when Minato drowns...but in her grief, Hinako discovers that singing a song they used to perform as a duet summons Minato into the nearest body of water—be it a puddle, glass, or bathtub. Will Hinako be able to reach Minato again?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
