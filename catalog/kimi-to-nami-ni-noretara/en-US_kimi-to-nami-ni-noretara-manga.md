## Sinopse

New college student Hinako, who moved to a small seaside town to surf and have fun, finds herself falling in love with firefighter Minato after he saves her from a fire. Their young romance comes to an abrupt end when Minato drowns...but in her grief, Hinako discovers that singing a song they used to perform as a duet summons Minato into the nearest body of water—be it a puddle, glass, or bathtub. Will Hinako be able to reach Minato again?
