## Sinopse

When the housekeeping robot Caret shows up unannounced at his front door, college student Ikeda learns he has been randomly selected to participate in her creator's "Life Improvement Project." Although he agrees to let Caret live with him based on her appearance alone, he quickly learns the truth—she can't be bothered to do any housework at all!

This is the daily life of a stubborn robot who can't do chores and her pervert roommate.
