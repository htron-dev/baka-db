    "sinopse": "1920, the 9th year of the Taisho era. Kiyo Fukasaku, a student freshly admitted into the Imperial University, lost his way while heading to his rental dormitory and met a man named Ozaki. Ozaki, who lived in a huge mansion, learned of Kiyo's financial troubles, and invited him to live in his mansion. However, Ozaki had many secrets—he was a fox spirit in human form, and he had invited Kiyo to live with him as a way to repay his debt to Kiyo's grandfather, Seishirou. The two continue living together, surrounded by secrets.\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)",
