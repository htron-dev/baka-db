## Sinopse

Asano is a hardworking employee, but has a deep-seated smoking habit. Whether it is under the pretext of being busy with work, or just having some time to spare, he can be found with a cigarette in hand. Materializing to accompany him each time he smokes is Tabako-chan, the anthropomorphized smoke from his cigarette. Asano's penchant for smoking as well as his dynamic relationship with Tabako-chan leads the two into various encounters and experiences with other smokers, each with their own personified cigarettes.

Through their personified relationships with sexy smoke girls, Tabako-chan explores the unique and vexing struggles of smoking addicts.
