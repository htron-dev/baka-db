    "sinopse": "Kusuko has a secret crush on the resident class playboy, Mishima. But with his constant rotation of ever changing girls on his arm, she keeps a safe distance. Mishima takes her stand-off-ish attitude for coldness and confronts her about it; however, they manage to overcome the misunderstandings and even begin dating! The more she gets to know him, the harder she finds herself falling, but one day, she overhears him talking to another girl on the phone...\n\n(Source: JShoujo Scans)",
