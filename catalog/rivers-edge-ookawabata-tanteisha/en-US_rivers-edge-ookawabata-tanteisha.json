    "sinopse": "The Ookawabata Detective Agency consists of three people: the old, bald, boss, the somewhat slovenly man Muraki, and the cute young lady Megumi. Rather than solving crimes, they use their investigative skills and network of people to determine the truth behind rumors and urban legends for their customers. Their range of cases can include anything from tracking down a person from the past to finding a love hotel with a 1-way mirror for voyeurs.\n\n(Source: MU)",
