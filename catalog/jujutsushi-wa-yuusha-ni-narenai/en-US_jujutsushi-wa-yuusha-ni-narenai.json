    "sinopse": "On that day, due to the outbreak of an unprecedented and abnormal event, 41 students from class 2-7 of Shiromine Academy are summoned to a different world, one full of magic. Separated and summoned inside a vast dungeon, where the only way to escape is to head to the deepest area, they are given the power of a Divine Protection \"Vocation\" as the only means of survival. While some of them are brave, some just do whatever they want, and some harbor treacherous intentions, they all aim to capture the dungeon.\n\nIn this place, one person gained a \"Vocation\" whose skills are unsuitable for combat, attendance number 19, Momokawa Kotarou. A boy with a small and lean build from the Literature Club wasn't blessed with a physical ability, swordsmanship, or strong magic, rather he only had the \"Shaman\" vocation to rely on.\n\nAfter being driven out of the group and left behind by his powerful classmates—his survival instinct starts running at full throttle! Pushed to the limit of survival in the different world's dungeon, what starts with trusting and loving each other soon ends in killing and betrayal.\n\nThe most beautiful and gruesome battle royal has raised its curtain.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, Novel Updates)",
