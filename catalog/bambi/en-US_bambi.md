## Sinopse

Set in the classical age of Korean history, a stubborn beautiful young lady finds herself one day out in the middle of nowhere… and to make things worse, she can’t remember a thing! Her name, where she’s from, and why she was almost about to drown in a pond. But fate would have it though, that a dashing young man with blonde hair and a wing for his right arm would rescue her. Somehow, deep down inside, this young man puts her at ease, and as she had lost all of her memories, she asks him to name her. With a face expressing the mixed emotions of sadness, remorse, and hope, he names her Bambi. Immediately, Bambi feels as though she has regained a part of herself as the name Bambi somehow feels so nostalgic. Especially the way the young man says her name… It almost feels as if she has known him since childhood...
