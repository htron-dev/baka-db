## Sinopse

Mounted warriors line up and rush to the assault. Brandishing swords on horseback, the warriors slash at each other... This kind of image of feudal combat is all a lie. Well, then, how did Samurai really fight? A declaration of war has now been made against the lie of combat that was forged during the Edo period, and continued uncontested to this very day.
