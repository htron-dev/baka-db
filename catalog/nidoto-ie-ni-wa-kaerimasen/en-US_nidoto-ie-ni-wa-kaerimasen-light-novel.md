## Sinopse

Chelsea Eucharis was born of noble ilk, but her life so far has been anything but easy. Day in and day out, she scrubs and cleans, obeying every order doled out by her mother and twin sister, Margaret. Refusal to do so means suffering under the crack of the whip and further starvation.

However, the chance to change her abysmal circumstances arrives when she awakens to a brand new type of magic: Seed Creation. Whisked away by the magic appraiser Glen, Chelsea begins a new life in the royal magic academy. As she learns more about her abilities, Chelsea makes new friends along the way, all the while learning to move on from the scars of her past.
