    "sinopse": "Takato Saijou, a young and attractive actor, has held the title of \"Sexiest Man of the Year\" for five years running. However, the up-and-coming actor Junta Azumaya has risen to fame expeditiously, and his momentum allows him to take away Takato's title. If that was not humiliating enough, he also surpasses Takato to be the lead actor in the new drama they are filming together. Irate about the change in his circumstances, Takato sees Junta as a foe he must promptly defeat.\n\nAfter accepting an invitation for drinks following the completion of filming one day, the next thing Takato knows is that he wakes up naked in Junta's bed. Junta shows him an unsightly video from the previous night, which Takato understandably assumes to be blackmail.\n\nTakato sleeps with Junta in hopes that the video will be deleted. But after receiving a sudden heartfelt confession of love and admiration from the other man, he realizes Junta's motives are not as malicious as he had initially thought. Although he puts up a front, Takato begins to enjoy Junta's endeavor to become the number one man in his heart.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
