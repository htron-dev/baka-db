## Sinopse

Compilation of short stories:

• Visconti no Eiga no You ni

• Romantic
Romantic is the story of Konrad Nernst, a German-native who falls deeply in love with the Japanese Viscount he meets in his homeland. Walking a tight-rope between restraint and desire, Konrad agrees to return to Japan with the Viscount and serve as his butler. Every day the pair face the censure and mockery of those around them; the powerful magnates that control the Viscount's estate, the staff he employs and his devilish wife, Hanako.
