    "sinopse": "Yoshida's poor popularity and constant teasing are caused by his unfortunate looks. He's short, scrawny, and is infamous for his almond-shaped eyes and the evident scar which plagues his left cheek. Just when Yoshida's school life continues to spiral down, Satou, the school's celebrity, confesses his love for him! But this is not good news at all when Yoshida assumes the worst in Satou since it's tough to trust those of high social status. With the help of both old and new friends, uncovering past memories, and the life-saving sound of the school bell, will Yoshida ever escape his bitter charades to his true sweet and friendly side?\n\nAitsu no Daihonmei breaks every rule in the romance handbook in the name of mixed signals, shared memories, and the sweet surrender of after school liaisons! Satou's feelings are crystal clear as Yoshida struggles in concealing his true colors. Blast off to the crazy adventures of Yoshida and Satou as the fruits of their labor grow of both their relationship, and of themselves as well.\n\n(Source: Alipio)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Kimi wa Happoubijin (You're Everyone's Friend)\nVolume 2: Kame no Koi wa Mannen A Tortoise's Love Lasts For A Thousand Years, Love is Swallowed Whole), Koi wa Marunomi (Love is Swallowed Whole)",
