    "sinopse": "Harumi's your typical grade 9 girl. Sure, she still sleeps with her stuffed animal that she dubbed \"Umetaro,\" and her ability to sense snow before it falls is labeled as just plain \"weird\" by her friends, but otherwise, she's your average girl just like any other.\n\nWhen her mother accidentally ruins her stuffed animal though by accidentally spilling coffee all over it, it sets the ball rolling for a series of events that changes her outlook on life.\n\nShe even meets a young guy working at a local knick knacks shop who reminds her of her beloved Umetaro! As she gets to know more about him, she begins to realize that there is someone out there in the world who'll accept her for who she is.\n\nAlso contains the short story, \"10, Even 20 Years from Now\".\n\n(Source: Pink Rose Scans)",
