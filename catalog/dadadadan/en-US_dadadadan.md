## Sinopse

One is super shy around girls. The second just hates them. The third could give a care unless she's 2-D. Welcome to Dadadan, a slapstick school life comedy following the antics of three fail males and their troubles with the enemy—females. Though the trio can't stand to be near the opposite sex (either out of hate, disinterest, or difficulty), the girls themselves have no problem migrating to them!
