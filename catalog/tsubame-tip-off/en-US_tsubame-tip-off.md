## Sinopse

Being overwhelmingly tall is a trait many sports players dream of, but for Tsubame Haruno, it's a nightmare. All she wants to do is blend in with the crowd. Sports clubs seek her out with high expectations, but when her natural abilities end at just her height and her true, clumsy colors are revealed, it's a disappointment for everyone involved.

Despite Tsubame having come to terms with her flaws, Ibis Akikaze—the ace of the girls basketball team—hasn't lost faith in her underclassman and recruits Tsubame into the club. What starts out as a simple favor for Ibis quickly becomes a passion that Tsubame gets hooked on, even after a few mishaps. With the help of the team, Tsubame learns to appreciate her height and make the very most of it through basketball.
