    "sinopse": "Fujisaki joins the Japanese Self-Defense Force thinking it would be easy money for his dream car. He hadn't realizing how much effort basic training would be. Cramped into boot camp with all guys, he grows increasingly frustrated without even a girlfriend to relieve his stress. His very strict drill sergeant, Muromi, who seems to like singling out Fujisaki, offers him a solution. (Source: M-U)",
