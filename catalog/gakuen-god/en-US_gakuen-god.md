## Sinopse

For the very first time, a serialization that’s published in China and Japan simultaneously!

“You will never be able to get a boyfriend for as long as you live!” Chiyo Ren is a very unfortunate girl who got put under a spell when she was a child. Sure enough, up until the present, she has never managed to get a boyfriend. The only person who can break the spell…is the malicious, ikemen, ‘Kami-sama’…!?
