    "sinopse": "Once upon a time, two ridiculous failures met. Kumada, once a talented rakugo artiste, had become a famously violent gang member. Uneducated Ogawa, dazzled by Kumada, had become frustrated with his own inability to use anything but the simplest of words. Together, this unlikely duo sought their place to belong in life and in love.\n\nThree extra tales of unexpected feelings complete this volume: one of sorrow and poetry in the early Shouwa era; another of close but distant brothers; and one that reveals the secret motivations behind the perfect... woman?\n\n(Source: DMG)",
