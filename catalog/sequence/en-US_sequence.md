## Sinopse

When Kanata takes a dare to ring a bell in an abandoned church, he doesn't expect anything to come of it -- and certainly doesn't expect to meet a vampire! The vampire, Titi, and Kanata soon find out that the two of them have become part of a "sequence", a spell that binds their lives together.
