## Sinopse

Passion drives successful Italian neurosurgeon Carlo Rossi in work and in play.

Desire ignites him when he sets eyes on Danielle Blake; he wants her.

Heat suffuses Danielle when Carlo makes love to her, awakening her senses for the first time.

Carlo insists on his rules: no commitment, no future, just a brief affair. But when Danielle must leave Italy, can he let her go?
