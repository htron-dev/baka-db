## Sinopse

To be honest, I think I'm pretty popular. But I don't really know much about love and thought that girls were all the same... That was until I met you. While being with you I end up looking like a fool. If it were other girls, I could easily sweet-talk them anytime, but in front of you my mind goes blank. Real love sure is on a completely different level...
