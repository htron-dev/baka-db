Chapters 1-4: Childhood friends Yukie and Kogawa are both in love with their other friend, Yamato.They relieve their unfulfilled sexual desire for Yamato by jerking each other off, but lately it seems they're progressing to something more serious... what will happen when Yamato finds out? Later on, a new guy enters the scene and he's also interested in one of the 3 friends. Will he be able to win his heart?

chapters 5: Kichii, Akira and Akira's older brother are models for Boyfriend Grand Prix magazine. Kichii made an unfortunate bet with Akira- if Kichii can outrank Akira's brother in the magazine boyfriend ranking, Akira will be his slave. Until then Kichii will be Akira's slave. Who will win? And why is Akira so determined to see his big brother beaten?
