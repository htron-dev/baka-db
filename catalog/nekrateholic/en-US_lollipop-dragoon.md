## Sinopse

Ikeguchi Wataru has a sexual addiction! But the young virgin has to take care of it himself. Logically, of course, this is all caused by a parasitic demon who eats arousal. Maybe that perverted foreign doctor and the Chinese Taoist potions master can solve the problem. [BU]

Written under the name Wasabi, Maguro.
