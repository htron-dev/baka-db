    "sinopse": "Sakuya is a noble vampire and master of seduction, but there's one detail that sets him apart from his neck-biting brethren... he no longer craves blood! Sadly, the lone object of his lusty affections -- the elusive dhampir Atsumi -- loves to bait his prey and run away. Is Sakuya's loss appetite really a matter of the heart? When the hunter and the hunted decide to make love and war, there's no telling how the tug-of-war will end!\n\nNekrateholic goes straight for the jugular with a blood-red tale of forbidden lust and cat-and-mouse mind games! Seductive Sakuya thinks only of the vampire hunter Atsumi, but the teasing dhampir is dead-set on testing every inch of the vampire's willpower. Who will come out on top? The stakes are high and straight through the heart in this erotic quest for eternal love!\n\n(Source: Juné)",
