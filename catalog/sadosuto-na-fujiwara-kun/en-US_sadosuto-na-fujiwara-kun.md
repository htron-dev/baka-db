## Sinopse

Fujiwara is popular at his school, inheriting his looks from his father who works as a host. But there's one problem. Everything he says is sadistic and host-like and he can't communicate what he really wants to say. One day, a fellow student, Ichinose, confesses to him. Even after she's sadistically rejected, she will keep confessing her love until Fujiwara goes out with her. What will become of sharp-tongued Fujiwara?
