## Sinopse

Matilda Paige is a plain girl working a simple job, helping resident doctor Henry Lowell heal the people of Somerset County. She has to split her time between her quiet boss, her ailing dad and a mother who wants to return to her former glory. While the job isn't particularly hard, Matilda just can't figure out Henry. On top of everything his fiancée, Lucia, is aloof and disparaging, hiding a mean soul under a beautiful face. Matilda may have a crush on her boss, but can she heal his heart and show him that a little warmth might be just what the doctor ordered?
