    "sinopse": "16 year old Choko Kokonoe leaves home to learn etiquette at a wealthy household. What she finds is that it is actually a salon where various artists (perverts) have been arranged to gather as it was her father's wish that she marry an artist. However, what they desire from her is not love, but her body. Sought after for their art, and unwilling to return home in fear of indulging in her feelings for her \"brother,\" she can do nothing but give in as her heart is thrown into confusion.\n\n(Source: MU)",
