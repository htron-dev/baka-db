## Sinopse

Hiroshi Minakami is a high school student, living alone since his father left him to work overseas. He thinks he is not beloved by fortune these days.

One day his old friend advises him that the key to recover luck is to help others suffering. He believes it, and saves an abused kitten, a lady collecting charity contribution and a dirty cherry tree, all of which bring results that his condition gets even worse.

However, in the night, a pretty cat fairy, a beautiful nymphet of crane and a cute little goddess appear and whisper love to him. It is the beginning of an embarrassing tripartite love-comedy.
