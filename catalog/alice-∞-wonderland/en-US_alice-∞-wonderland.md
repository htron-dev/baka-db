## Sinopse

She has lots of friends-
but hasn't had that important conversation...

She has a boyfriend-
but there is another girl...

Family too-
Her family... the only connection is through blood.

That kind of average high school girl-
Saitou Aya is suddenly lost in Wonderland!

The white bunny boy talks like a child.
"You are my Alice. Our savior..."
Aya = Alice's "Chosen world"?
Her "real self" is...?
