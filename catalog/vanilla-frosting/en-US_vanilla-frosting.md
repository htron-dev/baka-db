Aram is a high school student who lives with her food stylist aunt. Aram's parents had to live out of the country and her kind aunt was willing to move in with Aram to take care of her.

Out of her curiosity, Aram goes to look for the patissierie who was on that show... which will lead her to change the perspective on her life and future.
