## Sinopse

Sei is a Chinese student, studying in Japan. He stays at an apartment building near the college, which is full of students. One of the residents is a Japanese girl named Yukiko, who he really likes. It often seems that she likes him, too, but he has a hard time reading her signals. Cultural and language misunderstandings crop up between them, and Sei often ends up saying or doing exactly the wrong thing. Will he be able to win Yukiko's heart?
