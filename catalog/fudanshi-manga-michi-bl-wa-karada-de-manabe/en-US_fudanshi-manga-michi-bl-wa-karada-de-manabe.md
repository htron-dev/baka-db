## Sinopse

Through physical gay sex I'm trained in the ways of yaoi manga! The secret to becoming a popular, male yaoi-author is... to experience the joys of sex between two men personally! Jun Tachibana is a manga author who finds himself forced to create a series in a yaoi magazine. Completely at a loss, Tachibana defiantly complains to his brute of an editor, Akiyoshi. "There's no way sex between two men can feel good!" Tachibana's in for it now, as a Akiyoshi's eyes flash. "...How about I convince you otherwise? With your body, of course."
