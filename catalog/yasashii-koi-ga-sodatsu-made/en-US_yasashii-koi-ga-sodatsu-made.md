## Sinopse

Segawa Kotarou loves bonsai more than anything. He loves just reading about moss and plants so much so that the people around him tell him he sounds like a grandpa.

As a side job to pay for his university fees, Kotarou is a cram school teacher during summer vacation. While at the cram school he meets Nakatsu Towa who works at a computer repair shop below the school. When Kotarou finds out that Towa also raises bonsai, he asks to be friends.

However, will it just be friends, or will something more come from it?
