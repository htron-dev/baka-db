## Sinopse

Abe Maria has joined the literature club at her new high school, bringing their total up to three members. The other members include friendly Asada and Shinkai, an observant boy who often sees truths that others miss. It also appears that Shinkai is secretly a novelist! Shinkai uses his observant nature to unravel the events around him and the motivations of all the key players, usually likening the situation to works of literature.
