## Sinopse

Lugis is an adventurer who accompanies the Hero's team party. However, every day he has to fulfill tasks that are not pleasant at all. In addition, he is oppressed by the other members of the group. The only reason he remains on this journey is because of his childhood friend, Ariane. But she is fascinated with the team leader known as Hero. One day a shadow figure appears and tell Lugis, "Let me give you a chance. A chance to redraw your life." And so, Lugis is given the opportunity to be sent to the past to restart his life.
