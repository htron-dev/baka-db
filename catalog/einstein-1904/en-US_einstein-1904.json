Self-proclaimed genius, detective, and professor, Albert can detect the most minute details in any scenario and come to a rational conclusion. The recent murder of Russian soldiers by a mysterious oriental is no exception. The mysterious oriental, who turns out to be Japanese, proclaims that he is innocent of murder. Why? Because the Russians were already dead to begin with. Follow Albert as he seeks the truth in this mystery that crosses bounds between countries and fantasy.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
