## Sinopse

Several years after the Order of the Sword incident, Kyrie and Nero (who are living together) are approached by the weapon artist, Nico. While initially wary of her rude demeanor, Nero gradually warms up to her. However, some time later a certain demon attacks Nero.

At the same time, Dante's informer Morrison introduces him to the mysterious V who has a request for him. V tells Dante that suppressing this demon is Dante's reason for fighting.

This prequel novel to Devil May Cry 5 tells the story of how Nero lost his arm and how Dante and V were led to Red Grave City.
