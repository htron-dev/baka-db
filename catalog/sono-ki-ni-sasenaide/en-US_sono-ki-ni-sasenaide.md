## Sinopse

College is filled with boys in love. Kina, a college student, and the graduate student Megumu, have become sex partners. Will miscommunication and break up cause these two lovers to finally realize their true feelings? On the other hand, Megumu's assistant professor, Shibata-sensei, and fellow assistant professor, Kikugawa-sensei, seem to have been more than friends for many years. A lovely older couple versus a newly established couple -- let the love begin. (Source: Attractive Fascinante)
