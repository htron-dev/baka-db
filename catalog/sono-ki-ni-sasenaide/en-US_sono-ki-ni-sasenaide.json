Will miscommunication and break up cause these two lovers to finally realize their true feelings? On the other hand, Megumu's assistant professor, Shibata-sensei, and fellow assistant professor, Kikugawa-sensei, seem to have been more than friends for many years. A lovely older couple versus a newly established couple -- let the love begin. (Source: Attractive Fascinante)",
