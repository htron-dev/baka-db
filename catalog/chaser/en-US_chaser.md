## Sinopse

The manga takes place around the 1950's, when weekly manga magazines still didn't exist. A manga creator who is somewhat popular with three serializations tells people he thinks Osamu Tezuka's manga are boring, but secretly collects all of his works. He makes a one-sided rivalry with Tezuka, and seeks to surpass him.
