    "sinopse": "A new twist on the \"love doll\" genre. Tempted by an internet advertisement for a \"Necoco\" doll series, Eiji orders one on a whim, imagining a moe-tastic hadaka-apron-wearing girl to show up on his doorstep. Instead he gets a scrappy looking boy, and to make matters worse...he's an aggressive, tough-talking little brat.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Good Awakening to the Master",
