## Sinopse

Story takes place 20 years after the events in Love Neko. Asakura who invented Nekoko for his teacher Eiji when he was in high school, now owns a company that makes love machines. When he tries to make one to resemble Eiji, his old crush, it all goes wrong and this new love machine is programmed as a "clumsy-type."

Asakura got mad that he made a machine so clumsy and considers him useless. Therefore, Asakura decides to give the clumsy love machine to his younger brother Minami. Asakura never named the machine, except once he called him Eiji so Minami decides to keep that name for him. Minami has a more caring and loving approach towards the clumsy little guy and their relationship blossoms.

Meanwhile, Asakura gets stuck with another love machine that didn't sell out and no one wanted. His co-workers told him to try and get to know a love machine and maybe he would like them more. The fault with this one is that half way through love making, it falls unconscious. Even though Asakura uses harsh words with him, he still wants to stay by Asakura's side and their relationship unfolds.
