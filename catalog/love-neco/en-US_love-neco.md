## Sinopse

A new twist on the "love doll" genre. Tempted by an internet advertisement for a "Necoco" doll series, Eiji orders one on a whim, imagining a moe-tastic hadaka-apron-wearing girl to show up on his doorstep. Instead he gets a scrappy looking boy, and to make matters worse...he's an aggressive, tough-talking little brat.
