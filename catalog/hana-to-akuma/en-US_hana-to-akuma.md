## Sinopse

Two winters have passed since the high-ranking demon Vivi left the demon realm and came to the human world. Although he is pleased by its peacefulness, the tranquility of the surface quickly bores him. However, his peaceful lifestyle is soon interrupted after he returns one evening to see a crying child outside of his front gate. He decides to take in the abandoned girl and names her "Hana" on a whim—keeping her for mere entertainment and as a way to kill time. Unconcerned about the future, he pledges to abandon her if she becomes troublesome.

Fourteen years later, Hana continues to mature and grow on Vivi. Perplexed by her unwavering loyalty, he remains unsure of his feelings toward her. Can he really continue to maintain his old, unconcerned facade?
