## Sinopse

Mew and Mica, two spacey alien androids, pose as cute high school students to conceal their identities as the most undependable dynamic duo ever sent to defend the Earth. Their attempts to thwart shape-shifting monsters are almost as successful as their ability to create embarrassing situations for both themselves and their classmates.
