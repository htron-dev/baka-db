## Sinopse

Humor is the only defense against insanity in a world where the crime is so bad that the cops need armored tanks! Such is the world of Leona, ace tank-cop. In her pet tank Bonaparte, she'll either save the city of Newport... or destroy it trying! In No More Noise, Leona recruits some help to catch some slippery crooks—help that's rather crooked itself! The villainous and sexy Puma sisters become duly deputized officers of the law in this latest chapter of Dominion!
