## Sinopse

Cat has been in love with her stepbrother, Luke, since she was little. Her love for him has never wavered. But Luke treats her like a child and doesn't take her seriously as a woman. And yet, he is the only one she can love forever. Feeling at a loss, she tries a new approach. She enlists Luke to help her find the perfect husband, sure that if he looks hard enough, he'll discover that he's her man.
