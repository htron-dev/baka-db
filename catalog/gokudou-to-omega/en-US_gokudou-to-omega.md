## Sinopse

"Jeez... Going into heat in a place like this..."

I hate this, but I can't stop my instinctual desire... I can't believe that this first-rate, yet horrible man is my fated match...

Niikura Wakana is a romance writer who can't sell. Her editor recommended an assignment to her: interview the "first-rate alpha male," the young leader of the Koukyou yakuza group, Tatara Kunimitsu, for a magazine article! To get closer to this beautiful man of mystery, Wakana poses as a hostess for a high-end club, but she can't stop sweating from her nervousness... or so she thought, but in reality, she was experiencing her first heat! Bewildered by the awakening of her omega traits and unable to control or restrain her aching body, Wakana's pheromones attract a large group of men.

In this desperate situation, the one who comes to the rescue is...?! Is this feeling love, or is it simply animalistic instinct?
