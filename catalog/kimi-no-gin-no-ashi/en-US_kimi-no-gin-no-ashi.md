## Sinopse

Susumu, who was traveling alone, stopped by at a sports bar in the Netherlands. On the large screen monitor inside the bar, a para-snowboarder with an artificial leg was seen gliding down the snowy mountains. When Susumu said "Cool..." out loud at what he was watching, the guy next to him said, "That's me!" In the heat of the moment, the man who calls himself Tobias took him to the city at night.
