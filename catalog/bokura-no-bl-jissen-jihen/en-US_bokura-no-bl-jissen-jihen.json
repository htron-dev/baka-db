    "sinopse": "Asahi Ichinose is a manga artist who has super bad communication skills. During junior high, there was an \"event\" which made him feel something about his childhood friend Naoya, who had much better communication skills. \"What is this feeling...\" he wondered, when his editor says \"Isn't it love?\" And then he ends up drawing a BL manga based on that?!\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
