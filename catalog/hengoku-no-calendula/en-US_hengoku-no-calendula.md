## Sinopse

When I woke up, I was in the land of the dead...

Calen, who remembers nothing except that he was a soldier when he was alive, begins a life with Makoto, the person in charge of this land called "limbo". Calen is given the duty of being a shinigami by God to make up for his sins. Supported and cared for by Makoto, Calen's love for him grows. But once he learns that Makoto is a doll made from dirt that will one day die and return to the land...

This is a story of love through redemption, full of sadness and caring, told by amazing characters and a dramatic world view.
