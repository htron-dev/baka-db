## Sinopse

“Orangutans live alone in the forest, as if they cherish solitude.”

Ikeuchi Naoki is a young, enthusiastic high school biology teacher. Despite his inexperience, Ikeuchi wants to help and encourage his students, but he’s mostly ignored and looked down upon by them. One particular student catches his attention. The quiet Souga Takashi has some scary rumors floating around about how he was previously suspended for a violent incident. While trying to comprehend how the quiet Souga could be so violent, Ikeuchi comes across Souga’s future goals survey. It merely states “I want to become an orangutan.”
