As he's peeping on Yuto putting away some stuff in the gym storage room, something unbelievable happens...! Caught witnessing Yuto showing his true self, Kawachi panics and blurts out that he'll keep quiet if Yuto pleasures him! Kawachi feels terrible because what he's doing is basically blackmail! But, he just can't help himself. A relationship that starts with blackmail... Can it work!?\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
