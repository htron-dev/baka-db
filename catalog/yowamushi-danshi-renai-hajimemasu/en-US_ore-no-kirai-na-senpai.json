He's supposed to be my enemy, but why are we touching each other like this!?\" Sano's ambition is to become the most popular guy at school, and have lots of female admirers. Except there's just one person who's getting in his way to achieve it... Kiyoharu Azuma has a bad reputation for being a player, but the girls are still attracted to this bad boy. What's worse is Sano finds the girl he's after with Kiyoharu, which makes him even more motivated to one up the guy. Upset that Kiyoharu's fooling around with a girl he doesn't even like, Sano tries to embarrass Kiyoharu. But Kiyoharu's letting out some serious sensual vibes, turning things into an unexpected situation. A story between a guy who wants to be popular and a guy who's born to be popular!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
