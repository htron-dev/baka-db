## Sinopse

Volume 1: Boss to Hisho no Juunikagetsu (Shattered by the CEO)
CEO Rand Kincaid had never been coerced—until his entire future was at stake. Under the stipulations of his father's will, Rand had to rehire Tara Anthony as his assistant. It was either get along with the one woman who'd dared to leave him first, or lose his family empire.

But before Tara would accept, she gave Rand her own demands. She wanted a second chance, with Rand back in her home and bed as her lover. And nothing prepared him for where this arrangement would lead.
