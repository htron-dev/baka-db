## Sinopse

Kippei Yuuki is the #1 ranked player in the MMORPG "The Room," and he has the ego to prove it. Real life is boring, and he'd rather be the protagonist of a video game. But soon, Kippei's skills are put on the line when he and a group of others awaken in a prison cell. There are monsters nearby, and the environment seems eerily similar to The Room. How did they get here, and who will survive?
