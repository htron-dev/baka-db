    "sinopse": "Mr. Clice is a story centering on a super dashing spy, the special agent member of Japan's elite espionage program Jin Clice, whose body was mortally wounded by the KGB. The agency had already invested a lot of money in him, so they would not allow him to die so easily. In an act of desperation, in order to save him, the government transferred Jin Clice's personality into a new body, which happens to be that of a lovely young beautiful woman! (a recently dead tennis player), because they could not afford the cost to make him into a cyborg. The dashing ladies man has, in essence, gone from being Bond to being the Bond girl!\n\n(Source: MU)",
