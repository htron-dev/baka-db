    "sinopse": "As a noble cat, the Count knows a thing or two about living, but no one's lives are as strange as the Fujiwara sisters! Shizuka is only interested in live streaming for cheap online attention, and conflicted Yumeko is rather...fond of her big sister. Can Count Fujiwara handle these two perplexing humans, or will his meows fall on deaf ears?!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
