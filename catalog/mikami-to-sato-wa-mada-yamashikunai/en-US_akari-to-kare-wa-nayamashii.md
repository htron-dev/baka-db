## Sinopse

"Can you, a straight man, fall in love with me?"

The openly gay high schooler Akari is somehow displeased with his two (straight) friends getting together. Is it jealousy?

"Someday, I'll definitely find someone to love too!"

Having eagerly gone to a gay bar, the one he meets there is an irritating adult wielding a fair argument.
