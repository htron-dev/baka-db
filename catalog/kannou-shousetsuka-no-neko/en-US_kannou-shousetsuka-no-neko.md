## Sinopse

After a fight with his parents, Kageyama Ataru runs away from home where he is picked up by Yakumo Kaoru, a coarse self centered erotic novelist. In exchange for room and board, Ataru must surrender his body--?!

Also included is the one-shot “Rescue Me”; the amusing bargaining between an author and his editor.
