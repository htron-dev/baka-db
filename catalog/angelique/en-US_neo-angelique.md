## Sinopse

The orphan girl Angelique lives in Hidamari Villa with four other comrades who make up the Orb Hunters. They aid her in purifying otherworldly creatures known as Thanatoi who attack the populace, draining them of their life energy. Two large organizations also oppose this threat, while its members try to discover more about the Orb Hunters and a possible connection with the legend of the Queen.
