## Sinopse

Memory eaters live on people's memory. They are originally death messengers who remove human's memory when they carry souls. But some of them are charmed by the memory's beauty and become Exiles: Memory Eaters. Dio is one of them, but he does not steal human memory like other Exiles, but earns it by helping people. One day, Dio finds a girl who is losing too much memories from Exiles. He tries to help her, but Ces, who was a model death messenger, is around her. What is he doing here?
