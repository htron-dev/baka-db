    "sinopse": "The Hwan-Woong dynasty is in turmoil. General Hae-Mo-Soo has taken control of most of the land. Prince Chi-Woo, ruler of the Hwan-Woong dynasty, is so severely depressed by the hardships he's suffered during the Revolution that he has become almost non-functional. It's in this state that the prince is discovered by Gat, a peasant and close friend of the prince. Gat rescues Ghi-Woo from General Hae-Mo-Soo's men, but the danger is not over yet. Though Hae-Mo-Soo and Shi-Woo both lay claim to power, there can be only one ruler of the land. Gat and Chi-Woo begin their journey together, enduring heartache and hardship as they seek to reclaim the prince's rightful place on the throne.\n\n(Source: ADV)",
