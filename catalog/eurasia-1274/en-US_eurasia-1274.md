## Sinopse

The year is 1274, and the Mongols are invading Japan! It's Kublai Khan, aiming to conquer the world. But Japan has a secret weapon in a crack team of killers, known as The Carrion Eaters. Led by the vicious Ranomaru, who wants to take Kublai's head. Not all is well in Kublai's camp, though... a Korean leader might well be dissatisfied with what Kublai plans. This conflict will take them to the ends of the earth.
