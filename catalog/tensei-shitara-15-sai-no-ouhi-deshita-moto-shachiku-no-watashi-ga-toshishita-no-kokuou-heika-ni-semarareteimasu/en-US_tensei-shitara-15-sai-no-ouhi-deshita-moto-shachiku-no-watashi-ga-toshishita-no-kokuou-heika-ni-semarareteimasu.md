## Sinopse

I'm Saeki Emi, 28 years old. After I died from overworking, I was reincarnated and opened my eyes in the body of a 15-year-old queen. I have a husband (His Majesty, the King) but... He's only 17 years old! After I reincarnated, I thought I'd be pampered and live a life of luxury. But his Majesty said, "A reincarnator's life is likely to be targeted." (As you can see, my identity was discovered.) The original personality of her reincarnated body, Emilia, also appears as a ghost. Somehow, my second life is difficult and full of drama? I was released from being a corporate slave. This time, I thought I could live a relaxed and peaceful life...!
