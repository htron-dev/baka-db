    "sinopse": "Haruka Minazuki and Aoi Kannazuki are two students at St. Cherine academy. Haruka is always filled with bubbly energy while Aoi is more mature and a top student in all her classes - but despite their differences the two are the best of friends. The two girls look like any other girls, attending the academy, but the truth is they are hiding a little secret, that they can't let anybody know about...\n\nDuring the day they really are just students at St. Cherine academy, but they can also become the Twin Angel duo, and fight against the evils of the town!\n\nThe lovely Angels are back, and it's time for them to get ready for some action!\n\n(Source: NicoNico)",
