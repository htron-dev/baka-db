## Sinopse

A high school for the scum of society. The school is a final test of whether the students can become functioning members of society (i.e. not criminals).

Upon arriving, the students are given a score based on prior wrongdoings. By behaving properly, the students can gain extra points, while wrongdoings will lower their scores. Students who get 100 are deemed conformed and “graduate”. Students who end up with 0 points are ruled unfit for society, and they’re deprived their right to be come adults.
