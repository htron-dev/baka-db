    "sinopse": "This is a 4-strip cartoon that appeared in a newspaper, featuring the pre-school boy Ma-chan. Cheerful and naughty Ma-chan and his friend Ton-chan are always arguing.\n\nThis work strongly reflects the situation immediately after the war: Ma-chan wants to learn A-B-Cs from the stationed American soldiers, rather than the phonetic a-i-u-e-o from his father.\n\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)",
