    "sinopse": "After his first love confession is rejected, Yuuki Shibuki finds himself crying away his heartbreak at a park. Feeling depressed and blaming his short height and feminine looks for his failure, his pain is eased when he encounters a cool, hooded street musician who has a soothing touch with the guitar. The next day he meets that same musician at the park and learns that 'he' was in fact a tall girl named Chikako Takamine and that she was playing the song he heard the last time specifically for him.\n\nYuuki is quickly smitten by such an unimaginably dashing and handsome girl. To him, it is not love but instead, a miracle.\n\n(Source: MU)",
