## Sinopse

Based on the popular yuri ONA series, which is about the relationship between two fraternal twins and their daily life. Yukino and Kanade continue their schooling, and Kanade takes a late night art class in preparation for her future. As before, she usually ends up fooling around and drawing her sister in strange poses before finally getting her work done. Kanade begins to question the feelings she has for Yukino... does she feel a pure sisterly love for her, or are her feelings more perverted?

Also includes a seven chapter side story, Candy Boy: Young Girls Fall in Love!.
