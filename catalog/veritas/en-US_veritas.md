## Sinopse

Gangryong is a high schooler unlike others. He has always had a dream of being the strongest. One day he meets Yoochun, who teaches him a powerful skill. One year later, people come to see him and announce that his "master" is dead. Because he was his only student, Gangryong has to follow them and go to a school where everybody has supernatural powers.
