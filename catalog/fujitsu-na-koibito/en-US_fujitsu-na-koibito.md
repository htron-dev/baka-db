## Sinopse

Jacque and Liza were once deeply in love. They shared many happy moments until she discovered she was pregnant. Jacque had never wanted to have a child and always told her, "What I can give you is passion and friendship, no more than that." Therefore, she decided to raise the child alone and left Jacque without telling him anything. Three years have passed since then, when Liza unexpectedly meets him again. Knowing nothing about what happened to her 3 years ago, Jacque tries to seduce her, full of passion and irresistible charm. How can Liza keep hiding their child from him? (Source: MangaUpdates)
