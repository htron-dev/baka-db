## Sinopse

Sakibara Eitarou is a 22-year-old virgin. He's desperately trying to get laid—and that happens right at the beginning of the story with a girl named Maiko.

After that, Eitarou's relationship with girls change suddenly: he starts feeling more secure of himself and sex and starts meeting lots of girls. Three of these girls have a very important part in his life (Ninomyia Emu, Ide Miho and Jii Shinako) and his love adventures revolve around those women.
