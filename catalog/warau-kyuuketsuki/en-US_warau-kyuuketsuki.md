## Sinopse

Volume 1 : The Laughing Vampire.
While a young boy, just resurrected as a vampire, commits acts of awful ferocity, the city around him shows all its perversion. The adults abuse their power, the boys degenerate and use all the available means to achieve their goal to give vent to their low instincts. Whoever can't understand and make opposition is doomed to change or becoming crazy. So which is the real horror? The vampire who kills in order to feed himself or the crawling disease hidden in society, which slowy corrupts without being noticed?

Volume 2 : Paradise.
Following the events narrated in the first volume, Luna and Konosuke are now living together with the old woman vampire as fellows, as lovers, in a diabolic innocence, killing for quieting their thirst for blood, joining death and love under the dream of eternal youth. Meanwhile, a young boy named Makoto is looking for his lost sister Miko, who disappeared years ago in mysterious circumstances. But what really happened to that girl who liked eating grubs and dreamed of becoming one of them? And is there really a terrible secret that someone is hiding? The paths of all the characters will dramatically collide, bringing unexpected consequences after the things are gradually revealed.

A story suspended between weirdness and decadence, showing a clear nostalgia for German cinematography and Federico Fellini, where blood is used to trace a great and only apparently amoral story.
