    "sinopse": "Kosaku Shima depicts the life of Kosaku Shima, a salaryman, a Japanese white-collar worker who devotes his life to his company.\n\nAt the start of the long-running series, Shima Kosaku is a kachou, or section chief, of a huge conglomerate, Hatsushiba Electric. He is later promoted to buchou (division chief) and eventually promoted to manager and executive-director, and with each promotion the title of the series changed as well. He is now promoted to the president of Hatsushiba Electric.\n\nThe fictional conglomerate is modeled after Panasonic, or Matsushita Electric, where Hirokane worked before and is highly accurate in its portrayal of Japanese corporate culture.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
