    "sinopse": "Sakami leads a very normal life (except maybe for the fact that somehow her parents switched traditional gender roles). Until she meets Daiji and his best friends Shirou and Tenkuu. At first she can't stand them one bit but gradually she becomes their friend and a member of this trio. However, each of the boys has a very unusual problem and the now starting love-triangle is going to be quite something for all of them. It wouldn't be an Akisato of course, if the main focus would be entirely on the love-triangle and so she adds a huge deal of weirdness and humor to her work as usual. Soredemo... is a great and funny read that doesn't follow any genre standards at any time and always surprises the reader... especially in the end...! (Source: M-U)",
