## Sinopse

Tsuguto Sumihara is a high school student who ended his life with hatred and regret because he was involved in a certain incident. He should have died, but he woke up in a strange cave. People who do not have the scent of modern civilization. A huge mountain range as if piercing the heavens. When he meets a little girl of this world, understands that he couldn't be on Earth, and realizes that his eyes have a dreadful power, he begins his journey. This is a different world adventure story, woven with a poor boy, a little girl and a shovel.
