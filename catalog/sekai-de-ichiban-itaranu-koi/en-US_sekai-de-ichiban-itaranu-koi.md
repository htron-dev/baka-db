## Sinopse

Despite being very pretty, 15-year-old Mirai-chan doesn't have any friends due to her pessimistic personality. Tooru-kun is very handsome, elegant, and bright, but he doesn't even have a friend. Is it because of his social status? They both want friendship, but since it is the first time for them, will it be the beginning of the most immature love in the world?
