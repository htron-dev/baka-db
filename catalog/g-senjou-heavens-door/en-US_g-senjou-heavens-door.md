## Sinopse

Machizo Sakai's father is a successful mangaka (manga artist). Machizo hates that fact because he feels he's living under his father's shadow. One day he meets a boy in his class, Tetsuo, who enjoys drawing manga (and is quite good at it). Tetsuo's favorite mangaka happens to be Machizo's father. They strike up an alliance in order to win a contest sponsored by Machizo's father's publisher, with Machizo writing the script and Tetsuo illustrating.

The story is about their working relationship, about Kimiko who has a crush on Tetsuo, about the relationship between Machizo and his father, and about Tetsuo's relationship with his family as much as it is about creating manga.
