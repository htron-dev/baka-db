## Sinopse

Unrequited love is a tragic circumstance with no simple resolution. It comes in many forms, yet each one shares the same debilitating feeling of inconceivable longing.

Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya are two high school students who appear to have the ideal relationship. They are the envy of their classmates, and it is easy to portray them as the classic example of high school sweethearts. Unbeknownst to friends and family, however, there is a side to their love veiled by hidden passions: their true affections lie elsewhere, and they use each other to physically sate their unreciprocated feelings.

Hanabi is in love with Narumi Kanai, her new homeroom teacher who is also her childhood friend. Mugi is in love with Akane Minagawa, who used to be his tutor when he was younger. Now teachers at the same school, Kanai and Minagawa begin to show an interest in one another. As a result, Mugi and Hanabi find solace in each other as victims of the same pain.

With little hope of their feelings being realized, these two students face a challenging predicament: cope with and move on from their lust, or become further entangled in their web of unrequited love.
