## Sinopse

In a nondescript lounge, a blonde-haired man plays a game of pool, unaware of the maddening trial he is about to face. When a voice behind him shouts, "Spinoza!" he is hit in the head with a glass bottle, knocking him out. When he awakens, he finds himself fishing in a rocky valley. A moment later, he catches a monstrous fish which swallows him whole. Coming to again, he awakens on the floor of a ring, now the contestant of a boxing match in a packed arena.

Again and again the man finds himself in entirely new locations, each time the center of a different conflict. He has little time to act, however, as he quickly finds himself awakening to a new scenario. With no end in sight, the man moves through time and space across different dimensions with only one recurring word to connect them: Spinoza.
