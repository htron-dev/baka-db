## Sinopse

Shuusuke Takayama and the rest of class 2-A have just entered their second year of high school. For a bit of fun to start the new year, Shuusuke's long-time friend, Kazuto Satou, decides to make a popularity website where their classmates can vote for each other. Naturally, he sets up a vote for the girls first, and although everyone is a bit annoyed, they ultimately assume it to be harmless. But when the girl who received zero votes commits suicide, the class is shocked.

Some believe that the girl's tragic death was brought about by the popularity contest. Soon, however, a new vote starts, one that Kazuto had nothing to do with, and it quickly becomes clear that while Kazuto may have started the game, someone or something else is continuing it. As the body count rises, the remaining students of class 2-A will have to learn the rules of this deadly game or wind up victims themselves.
