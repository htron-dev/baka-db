## Sinopse

Mitsu who lost her memories after an accident at school is trying to re-learn who she is. She found a scribble she wrote a day before her accident that said "I like 'A.'" Who is this 'A'? Because her boyfriend's name is Hongou Hideto and there's no 'A' anywhere in his name. Did he know anything? Is he hiding something from her?
