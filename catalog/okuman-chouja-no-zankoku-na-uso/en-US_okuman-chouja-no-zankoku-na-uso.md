## Sinopse

Angel gifted her purity to Alex and believed he was the love of her life. But the very next morning, a ring fell out of his pocket. Angel was devastated and hid her broken heart beneath her memories. Six years later, she was a popular model on a small island in Greece for a photo shoot. While she was at a party on location, Alex showed up. Angel played it cool, but there was more than her heart on the line—she was keeping a secret from Alex that he must never find out.
