## Sinopse

The most beautiful girl in France doesn’t believe in love. Even though Oranjyu looks like the reincarnation of a goddess, she’s also the country’s biggest tomboy! One day while practicing with the family guards, a strange man approaches and declares that he has come to kidnap her. After a quick and clean display of strength, he introduces himself as her fiancé, Rishaaru.

Oranjyu has been focused on her daily training and the goal to find and defeat the bandit that killed her mother years ago. Thus, Oranjyu is completely uninterested in marriage until Rishaaru proposes a deal. As the strongest swordsman in the country, he could avenge her mother’s death in exchange for Oranjyu’s love.
