One day, as she's taken Pochi for a walk, she encounters Yamada, the #1 handsome guy in the class that all the girls adore. He asks her to come watch his concert at the summer fest. Yuuko goes to the concert all excited, without knowing Yamada's ulterior motives. As she experiences first hand the incurable cruelty of man, she makes the world's most atrocious wish upon the innumerable stars that cover the summer night sky.
