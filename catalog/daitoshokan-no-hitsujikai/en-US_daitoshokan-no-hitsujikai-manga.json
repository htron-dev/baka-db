    "sinopse": "The story is set at Shiomi Academy, a vast, prestigious academy with a Daitoshokan (literally, \"great library\") that rivals Japan's national library. As a member of the Library Club, Kyoutarou Kakei goes to Daitoshokan to enjoy reading by himself. He then meets a second-year girl named Tsugumi Shirasaki through the efforts of a so-called \"shepherd\" who fulfills people's wishes. Eventually, more girls join the club thanks to the \"shepherd.\"\n\n(Source: ANN)",
