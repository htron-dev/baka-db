    "sinopse": "Furiko, meaning \"pendulum,\" shows the highs and lows of a family of two—a high schooler, and his future wife, whom he rescues from delinquents. From the brilliant mind of comedian Tekken, comes a heartwarming story of a couple overcoming their differences even as they struggle through life. Not a moment goes by without meaning or expression in these four and a half minutes.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIn December of 2018, Tekken released an extended cut of film which features new music and adds one-and-a-half minutes of runtime.",
