## Sinopse

Looking for anything valuable to sell to replenish his depleting allowance, Fujisawa Takumi finds a TZM50R motorcycle in his garage. Strangely enough, the bike has a spirit, a female fairy named Timu. She is passionate and knowledgeable about motorcycles but is the jealous type, especially when it comes to other bikes. Takumi has always been uninterested in anything, but something inside him changes as he starts to learn about motorcycles from Timu and learns what it means to have passion in his life.
