## Sinopse

One morning, fifteen-year-old Yuuko Yoshida wakes up to discover she has sprouted demon horns and a tail! Not only that, she learns from her mom that she has supernatural powers and an important mission—to restore her family's glory by defeating the local magical girl. The magical girl in question is Momo Chiyoda, a student at Yuuko's school. With strength that is only mediocre at best, Yuuko's task to vanquish Momo will prove more challenging than she realizes in this topsy-turvy magical girl comedy.
