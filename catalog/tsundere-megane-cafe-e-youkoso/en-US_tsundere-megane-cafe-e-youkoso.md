## Sinopse

Welcome to Megane café, a place for food, fun, and extremely hot butlers?

While walking in with her friends, Kusumoto Sumire meets one of those butlers. But there’s something rude about him, weren’t butlers suppose to be nice-tempered and attentive? Suddenly the rude butler; named Tsundere Katsuragi, kidnaps her, giving Sumire her first kiss! Outraged, at first she vows to never go to the café again. Nevertheless, something about him is so addicting, she just can’t help herself.
