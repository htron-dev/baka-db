## Sinopse

This manga is a collection of one-shots which also includes Extra for Vanilla and Hashire! Oujisama (Already done by Obsession)

The strong-willed Asahi and the easy-going Tetsuro have been close friends since kids. Now in high school, those two still “share” their bento (box lunch). However, Asahi is asked to stop bullying Tetsuro, “because he’s too nice to tell you his true feelings!” But is that really how Tetsuro feels about Asahi’s bullying—?
