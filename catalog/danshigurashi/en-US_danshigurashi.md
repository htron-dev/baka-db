## Sinopse

Ryouga finally thought he was gonna get a place where he will be free of dirty messes. But as soon as he walked through the door, he found another guy named Keigo already living there and within one day the place was filthy. There was a slight mistake when it came to the rooms and until a new spot opens up, Ryouga will have to live with this messy guy. However, Ryouga has some rules in which they will follow - he will clean and Keigo will do the cooking because he's good at it. Daily life ensues between these two good looking guys.
