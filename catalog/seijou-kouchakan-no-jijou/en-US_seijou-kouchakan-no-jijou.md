## Sinopse

This tale begins with Shino who was in love with a girl called Maruyama. Shino asked his best friend, Akira, to set him up with Maruyama, but instead Akira betrayed Shino. Depressed, Shino goes to spend the rest of his day binging on cakes at the Seijou Black Tea House which is run by two mental cases by names of Shuuji and Keisuke. Mix a magical tea leaf, homosexuals, and various other things for ensuing hilarity. (Source: Taruby's Paradox)
