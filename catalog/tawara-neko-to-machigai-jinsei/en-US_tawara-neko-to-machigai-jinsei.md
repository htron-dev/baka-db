## Sinopse

Kotori was a normal girl who had always been tempted down the wrong path. As she lived her normal, boring, everyday life, trying so hard to follow her dreams, a bold chubby straw-bale cat walked into her life. Will this cat be a god of luck for her? Or will it become a god of misfortune, and lead Kotori down the wrong path...? A fluffy fat cat opens up the door on this story of a woman's struggles through everyday life!
