## Sinopse

The president of my company caught me, Chisato, kissing another man somewhere. Luckily, my company ranking is so low he shouldn’t be able to recognize my face! I desperately tried to convince myself of that, but several days later, I was selected to be the president’s secretary. This is horrible, it seems like the president knows about my relationship with men!

Presenting the love of a company president and his secretary – a super-comedy staged in an office.
