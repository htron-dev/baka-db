## Sinopse

Mayumi lost her fiancee to the only person she called a friend. Throwing everything away, running from it all, and starting a new life in the countryside was her plan, but what awaits her is a blonde yankee, Rin (the manager of the housing complex Seagull Villa), that she doesn't deal well with. A story about the daily lives and the relationship between these two women as well as the people in this seaside town!
