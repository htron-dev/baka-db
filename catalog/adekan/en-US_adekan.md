## Sinopse

Laid-back and somewhat absent-mindedly seductive umbrella craftsman Shiro (sans loincloth) and hot-blooded officer Kojiro, who stands against all things undisciplined, get involved in a bloody and erotic thrill-ride in an off-kilter town. This action packed jack-of-all-trades will have you swooning at its sexiness and leave you more addicted than opium! Tsujiki Nao's very first collection of works!
