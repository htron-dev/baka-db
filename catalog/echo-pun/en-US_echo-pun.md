## Sinopse

When they were little Eiko and Haruka liked to play superhero, although Eiko was better at it. But then Eiko had to move away, and they promised each other that they would keep on being superheroes. Now Haruka is in high school and is a fairly ordinary girl, and Eiko has moved back – and kept up her end of the bargain.
