## Sinopse

Akaba Ken is a top-rank stock-car driver who was involved in a horrific accident, which killed 6 spectators. He was badly hurt, but he survived and promised his younger sister that he would give up racing. He goes to America to help his father develop a new Formula 1 racer, but in the testing of the car runs at speeds that set records—so the pressure is on for him to return to racing, this time in the F-1 circuit. He has supporters, but there are also those who don't want him to come back, including those who caused the original crash…
