## Sinopse

42-year-old "shachiku" (company slave) Takeshi Matsuda gets worked to death, as is customary in Japan. His one dying wish is to work for a decent enterprise, not the black company he had been working for. His wish is heard by a god who, for his own amusement, has him reincarnate as a young elf male in another world, with increased affinity for earth magic and the ability to command golems. The new golem master sets out on a quest to acquire the Seven Treasures left behind by a legendary mage from 1000 years ago.
