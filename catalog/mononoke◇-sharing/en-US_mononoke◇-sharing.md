## Sinopse

Living with a bunch of roommates is always a learning experience—especially when those roommates are demons! Due to her family’s unfortunate circumstances, high schooler Yuta has to find a new and inexpensive place to live...which is how she ends up boarding with a bunch of wacky, big-breasted fiends. Chaos ensues as Yuta makes a new home and learns to live with the devilish hijinks of her new roommates!
