## Sinopse

Sadako Yamamura was just a young girl, thrust from society because of her dangerous and fascinating psychic powers. It's hard to imagine, but this girl who would eventually climb out of your television set and kill you with pure fear was once a very pretty and confused girl. This is the story of Sadako before she was a dead body in the well; the story of a scary power emerging from a nervous girl.
