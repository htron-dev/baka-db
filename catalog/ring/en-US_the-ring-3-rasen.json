    "sinopse": "In this adaptation of Spiral (Rasen), the legend of Sadako's evil takes a scientific turn as Ryuji Takayama's old college friend, Mitsuo Ando, must decipher a mysterious code while investigating this strange virus that kills people after watching a video tape. Disbelief gives way to fear. Logic bends to survival. And human evolution changes drastically. What Sadako plans is not simply horror, but something much, much deeper.\n\n(Source: Dark Horse)",
