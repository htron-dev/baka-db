## Sinopse

Devastated by the loss of both parents in a tragic accident, 18-year-old Chouko Mizushima loses her will to live. After living at the homes of several different relatives, she settles in with a handsome young writer named Kei Mizushima. Kei's a solitary, private person who is uncomfortable around most people and doesn't quite know how to deal with this emotional young woman. At first, Chouko can't seem to do anything right. But her dedication to tending the flowers in his garden leads Kei to eventually accept her presence. Will their growing mutual affection lead to something more?
