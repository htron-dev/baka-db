## Sinopse

Tsubasa is half human, half angel. Determined to become a full angel, he needs to earn love points match-making as a cupid. He's been failing until now, but his big chance arrived: he is given a mission with the lowest rank that should be easy to complete. But problems arise when he goes to see his target, an evil man named Norimasa who uses women for money. Although Tsubasa is able to shoot an arrow at Norimasa, he accidentally pokes himself with the other arrow. Both Tsubasa and Norimasa develop feelings for each other... but is it because of cupid magic, or is it true love?
