    "sinopse": "Ridiculously funny and occasionally heart-warming! 284 episodes of four-frame cartoon. A guy who loves baiting cats in the street, is sometimes moved to tears by the sunset, and can't stop looking at beautiful girls in the street…that's Young-kun. The voice of his soul shouts, \"When I'm on my bicycle, I'm cooler than everyone!\" ...a desperate, reckless, confidence born of youthful abandon. Come in and enjoy Young-kun's world! Twitter: @young_kun. The four-framed cartoon is a traditional and popular style of Japanese cartoon consisting of an introduction, development, turn, and conclusion... although, for Young-kun, sometimes the conclusion is missing!\n\n(Source: JManga)",
