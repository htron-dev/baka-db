## Sinopse

Fearing a magic power crisis, the sword and sorcery world of Fairleaf takes to summoning not people, but copies of entire buildings from other worlds. After repeated failures, one day they try summoning not a mere building, but an entire town—and accidentally get the entire neighborhood of Akihabara, the legendary otaku mecca. After an investigation, Akihabara's culture and technology spreads throughout Fairleaf, sparking a revolution.

Accidentally brought along for the ride, Kubo Toshinori runs the Galge company "Eternal Soft" in this new world. Alongside his cute Beastfolk assistant (and PR manager, and voice actress) Monica and his half-elf potion-binging programmer Iris, Kubo and Eternal Soft continue the constant struggle against deadlines, Twitter trolls, and software bugs!
