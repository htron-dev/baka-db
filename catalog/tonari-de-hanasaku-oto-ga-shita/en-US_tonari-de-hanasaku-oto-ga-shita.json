    "sinopse": "\"Sensei, an impure same-sex friendship, what's that?\"\n\nLove. It comes all of a sudden even to delinquents. A pint-sized punk is fascinated by the earnestness of the black-haired, pessimistic committee chairman; two punks start going out only as a defiance to everyday monotony; and two boys cut classes at their usual spot, the rooftop, where they end up having an adult relationship. Also after that, extras on these three couples. Triple features, satisfaction guaranteed. A compilation of oneshots packed with the follies of youth.\n\n(Source: Fujoshi Bitches)",
