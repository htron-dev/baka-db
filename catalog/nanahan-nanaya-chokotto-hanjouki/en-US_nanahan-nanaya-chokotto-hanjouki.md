## Sinopse

This 4-koma manga is the story of three sisters of disparate ages and a pawn shop.

The oldest, Orie, can often be found manning the counter at the pawn shop. She's a friendly, innocent young girl of 27, who often says the most awkward things. The middle sister, Sonoko, works as a yaoi novelist. It's a good career for a yaoi-obsessed girl like Sonoko! The youngest, Nanan, is a strange elementary school girl, who is in charge of most of the domestic work. She's obsessed with the Edo period and bases her speech patterns and hobbies around it.

The three girls spend their daily life at the pawn shop, pursuing their interests and interacting with various customers.
