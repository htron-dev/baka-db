## Sinopse

For all 15 years of their lives, Ami and Noa have competed against each other for love with the same results: both fall for the same guy, inevitably scaring him away and leaving them boyfriend-less. But the vicious cycle is broken when the girls go to a party and each fall for two different guys! With potential love on the horizon, the sky couldn't be bluer...until Ami discovers that these two dudes are actually duds with ulterior motives. Determined to get revenge on these players, Ami vows to make her guy fall for her while she trys to protect an unsuspecting Noa!
