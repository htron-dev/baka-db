## Sinopse

On October 10, 2016, Ryousuke Nanasaki married the love of his life, Ryousuke. But the time leading up to this day was anything but easy. Feelings of self-hatred, heart-wrenching breakups, and coming out to his family—it was all an uphill battle.

Based on the autobiographical web essay of the same title, Boku ga Otto ni Deau made follows Nanasaki's life and his journey to discover a happy ending together with his husband.
