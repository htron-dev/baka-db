## Sinopse

Folktales from Japan. Each episode was composed of two stories. The focus of the anime was to showcase folktales from different prefectures.

The original airing only reached 18 episodes (36 stories) before stopping, the show was rebroadcast at a later date and the final 8 episodes (16 stories) were shown. The anime was family oriented and funded by the Seibu Department Store chain with a "Seibu Family Gekijou" subtitle on each ep, perhaps to mirror the highly successful "Calpis Family Gekijou" adoring the World Masterpiece Theater anime program.
