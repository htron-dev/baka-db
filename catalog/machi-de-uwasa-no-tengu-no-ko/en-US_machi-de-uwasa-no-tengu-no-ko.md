## Sinopse

Akihime, the daughter of Ryokuhouzan's Long-Nosed Goblin, lives with her mother in the lower world and is attending junior high school. She continually refuses the offers of her childhood friend, Shun, who wants her to train with him in the mountains in order to become the Long-Nosed Goblin, because Akihime's heart is just too filled with her feelings for her classmate, "Takeru-kun."
