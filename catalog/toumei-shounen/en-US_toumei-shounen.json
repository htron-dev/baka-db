    "sinopse": "At the Ouka Acadmeic Institute, an elite all-male private school for the nation’s most gifted, exists a student council with some extraordinary members. Among them is Yuushi Satou, the student council president admired by every student. Despite his cool, elegant demeanor, he is a passionate leader. In fact, unbeknownst to him, his concealed passion is what makes him attractive to the rest of the students. Backed by a beautiful bouquet of boys to round off the council, this all-boys school is ready to burst.\n\n(Source: DMP)",
