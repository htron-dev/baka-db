Although he appears to be a normal high school student at first glance, there is one thing about him which isn't normal. He's haunted by the ghost of a young girl, Minakami Misao.\n\nTomoharu moves to his new place of residence, Meioutei, and starts enjoying a carefree high school life. But this is all ruined when a beautiful girl named Kurosaki Shuri appears with a trunk which Tomoharu's brother told her to pass on to Tomoharu. The presence of the trunk causes the appearance of Takatsuki Kanade, a girl dressed like a shrine maiden who is after the trunk.\n\nBecause Tomoharu is in possession of the trunk, he will come face to face with the the hidden truth of this world.",
