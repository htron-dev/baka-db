## Sinopse

Shiori Itai, 26 years-old is an office lady who has gone through her entire life boyfriendless. She might look apathetic, but she still wants to be loved as much as anyone. Never letting a hot tip go to waste, constantly challenging herself. However, her natural awkwardness and cringeyness tend to lead to unfortunate results. An unfortunate but lovable OL's daily life!
