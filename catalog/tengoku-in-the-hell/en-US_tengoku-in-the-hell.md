## Sinopse

Yutaka is a man with many faces. He's an indie label producer, an art space and general store manager, and an escort on the side. While escorting, Yukata is hired by a succubus-in-training, Tsukasa. Though at first Yukata is wary of Tsukasa, he is soon charmed by him and decides to make Tsukasa into a top idol! Where will these two end up on this super roller coaster love comedy?
