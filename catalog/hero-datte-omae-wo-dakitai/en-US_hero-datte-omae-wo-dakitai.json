Even offstage, he comes to her rescue whenever she has a problem, just like a true hero. He fits the hero profile so well that she simply can't imagine him with a girlfriend... But one day, after doing some overtime, Haruka and Ichiya are the only two left, and his attitude totally changes! He embraces Haruka and makes her lose control of her voice...\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
