While he appears to be ever-so-slightly moved by Alex's straightforward, if tacky, affections... It's only a ruse. Secretly, Kanata's the deadly hit man \"Black Swan,\" hired by an enemy family to assassinate Alex. He's been in disguise, waiting for his chance to strike... But Alex won't seem to let his guard down, forcing Kanata to use himself as bait...!!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
