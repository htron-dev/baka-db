## Sinopse

The greatest big city in Japan: Gure-Tokyo. A town which gathers the dreams and aspirations of the yankee boys from throughout the country. With less than 0.2% teachers in the town, the delinquents are free to roam however they want. In this "Gure-Tokyo Dispute" of the Violent Yankee Era, they are all planning to carve their names with the legends, but when extra-ordinary "yankee" Chagecha arrives in this town, everything is about to turn upside down. Come and read this hilarious Yankee-manga for good kids!
