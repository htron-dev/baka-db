    "sinopse": "888 follows Hisago, Tsukumo, Shimeki, and Kobayashi-Kun, Shimeki's cute doggie. These four run a detective agency. Though they usually don't get a lot of customers, Hisago's dad still gives them money every once in a while so they stay afloat. But when they do, boy are they big cases (they have to find a lost pet).\n\nThere's no blood in this story though Shimeki does get kidnapped by his ex-wife and is forced to make dinner for her with a knife to his head. There are no mysterious deaths or high speed chase scenes. They're simply a detective agency who just happens to be floating along picking up any case they happen to get.\n\n(Source: Karoshi)",
