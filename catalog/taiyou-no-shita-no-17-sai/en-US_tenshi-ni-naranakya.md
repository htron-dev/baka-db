## Sinopse

Contains 6 stories...

A waiter takes in the freeloader at the restaurant where he works. The latter claims he's got amnesia.

While sitting and waiting in the park for his beloved to show up to give him an answer that will decide his next step, a man contemplates past conversations with her.

They're both interested in the same girl who's in the same club as them, the Track & Field Club. The geeky four-eyed versus the handsome athletic one; do nice guys always finish last?

Again, it's two men and a woman. This time, though, one of the men is harboring a secret crush on the unknowing other whose ex-wife isn't as oblivious.

The student whose part-time job is playing piano at a bar has been getting song requests from a frequent patronizer. One day, the latter puts forth a different sort of request. He would like him to spend some time with him in return for cash. The part-timer agrees as his every wish is indulged and he doesn't even have to have sex with him.

An unrequited crush on a senior ends this volume.
