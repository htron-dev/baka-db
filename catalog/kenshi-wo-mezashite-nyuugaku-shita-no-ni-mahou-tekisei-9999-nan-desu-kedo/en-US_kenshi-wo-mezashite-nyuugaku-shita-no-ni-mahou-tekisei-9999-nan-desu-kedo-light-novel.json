    "sinopse": "Laura who had received special education to be a swordsman from her A-Rank adventurer father since a young age, enters the Royal Capital's Adventurer's school at the age of 9. Laura filled with expectation in her heart in hopes to make many swordsman friends. At the day of the entrance ceremony, Laura's sword aptitude value was measured at 107. Between normal students whose aptitude value is around 50-60, Laura was definitely a sword genius, but the magic aptitude that was measured after that was 9999. Laura was stunned, and while she didn't know what was even happening she was transferred to the Magic Department.\n\nContrary to Laura's will, she exerts her super-genius, and instantly becomes stronger than anyone in the school.\n\n(Source: Paichun Translations, edited)",
