## Sinopse

The "Diamond Delinquent" Akira Kongou transfers to Shiritsu Raimei High School and despite his insistence that he isn't a banchou (a Japanese student delinquent and gang leader), he quickly rises in the ranks of Shiritsu Raimei's gang until he becomes the leader. Now Akira takes part in schoolyard battles against the bullies and punks from the twenty-three neighboring schools.
