    "sinopse": "The Geisha Tokyo Entertainment company has announced on Wednesday it is producing and airing Sakuran Boy DT, \"Japan's first\" Flash-animated television series about a local costumed hero character. The name of the character is a wordplay on the Japanese translation for \"cherry boy\" — the Japanese slang for a male virgin — and the Sakuranbo television station in the northeastern Japanese city of Yamagata. The story revolves around Satou-kun, an ordinary high school boy who transforms into Sakuran Boy DT to rescue the mayor's daughter from the nefarious secret society Zaou. Sakuranbo has posted a trailer online, and the 11 five-minute weekly episodes will premiere on this station on January 14.",
