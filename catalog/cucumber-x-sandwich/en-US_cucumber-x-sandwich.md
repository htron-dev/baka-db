## Sinopse

After losing their parents at an early age, Natsuhiko and Haru had to be seperated. Years later, Natsuhiko opened a cafe hoping to fulfill his and his parents' dreams. After an incident with a customer, Natsuhiko finds out that he is his younger brother. Unfortunately, he now works as a host. Not only that, Natsuhiko had racked up plenty of debt to finance his cafe. Can Natsuhiko overcome these obstacles and convince his younger brother to come back and keep his cafe, and their dreams, alive?
