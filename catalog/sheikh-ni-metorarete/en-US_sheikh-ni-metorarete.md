## Sinopse

Chloe secretly carried and gave birth as the surrogate mother of her half sister, the queen of a desert country. However, as Chloe waited for her sister to pick up her baby, her sister and her husband perished in an accident. To Chloe, who is a dedicated researcher and has never given any thought to love or marriage, the child they left behind is her only blood relative. She's determined to raise the child with all her love, no matter how difficult it might be. But then Sayid, the younger brother of the late sheikh, who is now serving as regent, appears at her door. With a cold, stern expression, he informs her that he has come to collect his country's future ruler and is prepared to take the baby by force. Now the only way for Chloe to stay by her child's side is to marry Sayid! She will do anything for her child—even wed Sayid in a loveless marriage. But will her heart be able to withstand the charm hidden under Sayid's serious facade?
