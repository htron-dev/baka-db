    "sinopse": "The energetic and affable You Kamiyama has a minor brother complex. His habit of following his brother, Yuu, has earned him the nickname \"Hiyo\" since he acts like a chick following around his sibling. On the other hand, Yuu's best friend, Komiya, has an ever-so-slight complex for his little brother, Mayuki.\n\nHiyo and Komiya are content with the status quo, but everything changes when Yuu and Mayuki announce their relationship. Scared of being left behind, Hiyo and Komiya hatch a plan to fake-date so that they don't lose their brothers' attention. However, even the best-laid plans go astray. When the time comes, will Hiyo and Komiya end their charade as lovers?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
