## Sinopse

KOKE-kun is a merchandise franchise of eight cartoon characters that each represent a real species of moss. To promote the brand, the Real Koke-kun initiative was born, where flash mobs dressed as the main green moss character would appear around Japan. During this time, an animated version of Real Koke-kun was created by Takashi Taniguchi.
