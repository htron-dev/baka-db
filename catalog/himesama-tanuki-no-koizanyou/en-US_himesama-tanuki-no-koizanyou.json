    "sinopse": "Riku planned to move to Kyoto, together with his childhood friend Momoka. Instead, his parents have him betrothed to the cuddly Tanuki princess Miyo! She can turn into a woman, but being a human is quite difficult: Miyo cooks scrambled eggs with their peel, washes herself in the washing machine and sometimes nibbles on a grasshopper. But thanks to Momoka, she quickly learns what jealousy is.\n\n(Source: Kazé)",
