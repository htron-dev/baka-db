## Sinopse

While on a high school field trip, a school bus crashes into a shrine of a penis god. This serves as a catalyst for a group of four high school boys to switch penises with each other. At first a rather typical yaoi, the series quickly delves into comedy antics with talking penises, penis costumes, and puns.
