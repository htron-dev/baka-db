## Sinopse

Supermodel Lydia took part in a fashion show organized for a charity for disadvantaged children. But the money from the show disappeared, and it was Lydia's mother who stole the money! Lydia cannot accept that this is what happened, even after being investigated by the police...because she blames herself for her mother's unhappiness. It is the wealthy Christiano who lends Lydia a helping hand in her time of need. Although his intentions are to spend the night with her! (Mangafox)
