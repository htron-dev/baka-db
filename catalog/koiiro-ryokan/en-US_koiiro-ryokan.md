## Sinopse

Her parents ran away in the night, so Tsugumi becomes a free-lodger and worker at a traditional hot-spring inn called "Yukiwarisou" where she used to play with a close friend, 'Icchan', when she was little. However, there she finds three handsome brothers, Arashi, Nagi, and Haru. Gradually the distance between them and her starts to close in, but who among them is "Icchan?!"
