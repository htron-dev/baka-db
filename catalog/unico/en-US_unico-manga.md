## Sinopse

The Goddess Venus is jealous of the beautiful human girl Psyche and blames her pet unicorn, Unico, as Psyche's source of good luck. Venus has Unico banished, and it becomes his fate to forever journey from one place and time to the next, with the West Wind.

Unico is a little unicorn which has the ability to make everybody happy. That's something the gods don't like of course. So they send out the west wind to bring Unico to a place where Unico never will be seen again. The west-wind however isn't able to as she likes Unico too much and brings him to a lonely island instead. From there, the adventures and travels of little Unico start.
