    "sinopse": "Based on \"Unico and the Kingdom of the Sun,\" which was newly written as a theater version, this animated film features a battle between the wizard Kukuruku and Unico. Kukuruku builds a castle using dolls transformed from men as building parts. The story revolves around the sorrow and terror of men who have been transfigured into dolls, and a girl named Cherry who wishes to recover the kindness in her brother, who is a student of Kukuruku. This work reminds us of the fact that \"transformation\" or \"transfiguration\" - favorite themes of Tezuka Osamu - involves not only material aspects, but also man's immaterial heart.\n\n(Source: Tezuka Osamu's Website)",
