    "sinopse": "Private Ronald endures rigorous training day in and day out under the command of the base's most handsome but also toughest instructor, Captain Ashford. One day, when Ronald goes to deliver a package to the captain's office, he's struck by the image of his superior smiling in a photograph, and uses the opportunity to pleasure himself in the captain's absence. But what happens when the captain catches him in the act and insists that he's in need of some \"punishment\"...?\n(Source: Nakama)",
