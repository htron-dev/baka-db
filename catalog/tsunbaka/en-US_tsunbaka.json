    "sinopse": "The story originated as a 2chan thread and was later adapted into a web comic drawn by YOKO, similar to how Onani Master Kurosawa was created.\n\nA heart-warming tale of friendship, love and strength, Tsunbaka attempts to create a new archetype in the \"tsun\" genre of girls. Combining the fierceness of a \"tsundere\" and the air-headed/forgetfulness of a stupid \"baka\" girl, comes the titular type and character Tsunbaka. This manga focuses on her daily life and her best friend Boon, who helps and protects Tsunbaka, as well as the greatest supporting character Dokuo.\n\n(Source: MU)",
