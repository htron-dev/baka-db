## Sinopse

If not for the knowledge of her previous life, Rosemarie von Werfald would have been as haughty as any other noble girl. These memories clue her into the truth behind her new life: she is in the world of an otome visual novel she once played—and as the villainess no less!

From what Rosemarie can remember, the game was quite terrible, with a story that only had unappealing routes. From a siscon brother to a necrophiliac wizard, none of the romanceable candidates were any good. But there was one redeeming quality about the game—the side characters. Kind and gentle, they were truly top tier men; and Royal Knight Commander Leonhard von Olsen rose above them all. Being reborn into the world where he resides, Rosemarie can now finally pursue the unrequited love she harbored, all while striking down destruction flags that would lead towards the game's premature end.
