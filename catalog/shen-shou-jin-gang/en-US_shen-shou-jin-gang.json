    "sinopse": "Many years ago, the ambitious Dark Emperor who wanted to rule the universe endangered the environment and destroyed peace. In order to stop him, the leader of the universe, Big Dipper King, finally sealed the Dark Emperor under the polar ice rocks after a great battle. In order to prevent the Dark Emperor from breaking the seal, the Big Dipper King discovered the six God Beasts of the Earth under the guidance of the Earth’s monks. Fusing technology and the energy of the Big Dipper, he created six God Beasts Mechas and left behind his son, the Qilin King. The six God Beast Mechas are Qilin, Qinglong, Baihu, Xuanwu, Zhuque, and Yinglong. Only six children with super powers can pilot these God Beasts.",
