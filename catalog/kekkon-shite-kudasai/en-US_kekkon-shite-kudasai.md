## Sinopse

Kairi Sasaki, an omega, is a newbie employee working at a marriage counseling company. His problems lie in his client—the handsome alpha, Haruomi Jinguuji—who doesn't seriously look for a marriage partner. What's more troubling is that this elite tries to make advances at him at every opportunity! Now, will Kairi be able to make Haruomi marry someone...?!
