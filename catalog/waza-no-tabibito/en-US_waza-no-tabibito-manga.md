## Sinopse

There are people in the world who have strengthened their heart and spirit beyond imagination; so much so that they are able to materialize objects just by willing it and its potency is only limited by the users' determination. These people from the far east call themselves the Wazabito and are admired for their power that transcends the physical universe.

Tekuni is a cute Wazabito swordswoman who is traveling the world to train and master her abilities. With her friend Huk-Ro, the owl of knowledge, Tekuni wanders from one danger to another and makes friends in the process.
