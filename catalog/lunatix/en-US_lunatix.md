## Sinopse

Before the new millennium 2000 AD, the space plan to abandon nuclear weapons in the core of the sun failed, and the "Zeus Project" fell into the moon's gravitational pull. At the same time, ten Tsuki no Kakera (Fragments of the Moon) awakened on Earth, but these ten people know little of the powers they now possess...

Senior High School student Hiroaki Rashou can't hide his confusion when he's suddenly drawn into an unknown battle, along with his close friend, Yuuzou Andou, the guitarist for the popular indie band, Rhodesia. To make matters worse, Hiroaki's friendship with the student PhysEd teacher Seitarou Meguro causes a rift with others - until he finds himself under attack from strangers with violent powers!

Before long, Hiroaki is confronted by Kazusa Nitta, who claims to be a journalist; and who seems to understand the bizarre events surrounding Hiroaki. And Yuuzou is suddenly reunited with his older brother, Yuuji Iki, who also knows the truth of the Fragments of the Moon - but is he hiding something from his brother?

What is the meaning of the Fragments' power? Discover the fate of the battle that brings these ten people together in this hard-core neo battle novel.
