    "sinopse": "Meet rookie Detective Glen and his superior, the youthful Inspector Marcus. You never know what the Inspector is thinking, but when Glen is injured by someone during the investigation of a horrific murder, Marcus visits his hospital room often, teasing and taunting Glen.\n\nAll the while, shaking with temptation, Glen has to wonder, What is Marcus' intent?

And who is the gruesome, horrible murderer?\n\nAlong with this rough tale, see Japan in retrospect as it becomes the stage for a powerful story about childhood friends...\n\n(Source: M-U)",
