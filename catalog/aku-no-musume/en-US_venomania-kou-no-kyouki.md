## Sinopse

In his Lasaland mansion, Sateriasis Venomania impales himself on the Venom Sword, making a contract with I.R. and the Demon of Lust; as a result, his body is filled with "Bloodlust". Several months since then, in the Summer of EC 136, Kachess Crim reads a report of women who have gone missing in the Asmodean region, including Lukana Octo, Mikulia Greeonio, and Gumina Glassred. He lingers on the last name, Lilien Turner, who has disappeared in April of EC 136, the same year as Lukana's disappearance.
