    "sinopse": "Hadori Kento is a normal high school student whom can be found anywhere in the world, but \"he\" actually is not so normal. Kento holds a certain secretâ€”he has the ability to accelerate himself to extraordinary speeds. Why he has this ability and for what he should use it, he himself does not know yet. Without finding the answer, he spends his life very peacefully...that is until he meets a person with the same ability.\n\nThe person he meets is a serial slasher called \"Silent Killer.\"\n\n(Source: Dengeki G's magazine Web)",
