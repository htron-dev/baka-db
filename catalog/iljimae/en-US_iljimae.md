## Sinopse

The Korean version of Robin Hood, "Il-Ji-Mae" deals with a hero who helped the unprotected poor men by robbing the rich and the powerful ones.

This was adapted into a drama by SBS in 2008

Set during the Joseon Dynasty, Yong acted as a hooligan in the marketplace by day but at night he was a thief who robbed corrupted government officials to give to the poor. After each robbery he left behind a painting depicting a plum tree branch to make his mark and was thus named Iljimae. His main purpose was not so much to rob but to search for the owner of a specially designed sword which he saw as a child was used to kill his father, a loyal subject of the emperor.
