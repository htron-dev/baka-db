    "sinopse": "When Shinichirou's beloved dog, Flappy, starts acting up and disobeying commands, his trusted vet gives him a strange and unexpected referral: he sends Shinichirou to his long-time friend, Narusawa, a college professor who can apparently communicate with animals. At first Narusawa denies that he has this special skill, but a snarky, talking, black cat gives away Narusawa's secret and reveals that Shinichirou may have this special gift himself...and soon Shinichirou is hell-bent on becoming Narusawa's \"pupil.\" Will Narusawa give in to his advances? And if he does, will Shinichirou come to regret it?",
