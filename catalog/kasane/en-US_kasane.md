## Sinopse

A 21-year-old man, Shinkichi, is employed as assistant by the beautiful ageless shamisen player Toyoshiga. Despite the considerable age difference, they became lovers. But Toyoshiga is a jealous woman who can't stand the attention paid by her students to Shinkichi, in particular the young and pretty Ohisa. Her jealousy grew bigger and bigger and began to reflect on her face while the hourse's ghosts made more and more apparitions.
