## Sinopse

Before she died, Taga Reiji's mother made arrangements to ensure her son would not be alone. What Taga did not know about these "arrangements" was that he would be enrolled into a special class at the school his mother founded where prospective fiance candidates would all vie for his hand in marriage. How will Taga's new life of constantly being surrounded by girls unfold, and will he be able to choose just one?
