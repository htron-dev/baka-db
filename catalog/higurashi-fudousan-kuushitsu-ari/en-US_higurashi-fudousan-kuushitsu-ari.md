## Sinopse

The Higurashi Real Estate resides in a small, non-descript office building where Minokawa Naoto works. Everyday, he has to deal with the sketchy customers and his extremely perverted boss. She loves to have sex in apartments that are left deserted by the tenants that cannot pay for their rent. With his salary being so low and his boss sucking him dry, will he make it?
