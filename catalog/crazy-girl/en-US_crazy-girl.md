## Sinopse

16-year-old Hanii Miku is on the same tennis team as her life-long crush, Harada Tomonori.

Not only can this guy kick ass in tennis, he's also good-looking and super nice! The only thing that Miku doesn't like about him
is his brother, Natsume. Completely opposite from his older brother, Natsume is known to play girls, and be a basic cocky pain in the neck.

But one day, Miku finds out something about him that ends up shocking her to no end...!!
