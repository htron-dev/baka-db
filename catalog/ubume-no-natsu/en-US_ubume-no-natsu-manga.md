## Sinopse

Tokyo, 1952. The bizarre case of a missing doctor and his supernaturally pregnant wife captures the imagination of novelist Sekiguchi Tatsumi, so he enlists the help of an old friend, Chuuzenji Akihiko, a bookstore owner and part-time exorcist who begrudgingly agrees to help investigate the disappearance. They'll face a family's darkest secrets... Secrets that Sekiguchi himself can't escape.
