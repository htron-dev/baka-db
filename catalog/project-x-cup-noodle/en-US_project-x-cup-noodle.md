## Sinopse

In a time when the Japanese food industry was struggling economically, a man named Momofuku Andou sought to turn the tide. Seeking a new type of food for a new era, he ordered the development of a "cup noodle" - a revolutionary idea for a convenient instant noodle. Overcoming public skepticism as well as doubts even from those within their own company, Andou and his staff of young developers constantly challenged convention to create this new product. Behind the now familiar cup o' noodle, which has sold over 8.2 billion worldwide, there lies a dramatic story of the struggles of the men behind its success. (Source: DMP)
