## Sinopse

Somewhere out there, is a small shopping arcade full of quirky, mysterious stores. There you can meet with a lace-seller who deals in ornate lacework left behind by the deceased or find yourself in a shop that sells "artificial animal eyes."

Follow the young landlady of the arcade as she interacts with the store owners, their customers, and the magical objects they deal in, interacting with spirits and drawing on powers from beyond the grave.
