## Sinopse

When her mother decides to remarry, Honoka inadvertently becomes "family" with the rising star she's infatuated with, Masaki Izumi! Honoka can hardly wait to become like the families in Masaki's TV dramas... but the guy himself is a far cry from the roles he plays. In real life, Masaki is seductive, rash, and forceful, and he's decided Honoka will become his woman...!? _gasp_ But that would be... SCANDALOUS! (From ShoujoMagic)
