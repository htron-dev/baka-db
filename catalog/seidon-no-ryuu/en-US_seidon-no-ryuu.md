## Sinopse

The country that believes in Dragon, Dragonemund. Living within a small village in the country, Manato, was living peacefully with his step-family. One day the bishop of the church, Cliff, along with the church's soldier the "Dragon Soldier" came to the village for a procession.
That became the day that changes Manato's life. Having all of his precious things swallowed in front of him, Manato decided to fight back!
