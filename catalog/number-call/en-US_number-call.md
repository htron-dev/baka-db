## Sinopse

After being cornered, a path opens up. Ever since he was little, he's been carrying the weight of the name "Eight." Through the power of "8," he is drawn to a classmate, Hatta Tomoya, nicknamed "Hachi." Exchanging greetings and small talk, his daily exchanges with Hachi begin to build up. With this, it begins to instill change in Eight.
