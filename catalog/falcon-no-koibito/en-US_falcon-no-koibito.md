## Sinopse

The burning desert sun has lit a fire in my heart...

Bethany's father, an anthropologist who was researching a community in the Arabian Desert, has gone missing. Bethany received word from the authorities that he died, but she doesn't believe it—he's survived dangerous situations before. Bethany flies out to find him and encounters a handsome man with a peregrine falcon. The two lock gazes, as if drawn by a strong, mysterious power. The man reveals himself to be the Sheikh of Bayrar, Prince Zakr Tahnun Sadiq. And for some reason she can't explain, even to herself, Bethany is drawn to this prideful man...
