Based on the pop-up screens she can access, it seems like she has entered some kind of RPG as a magic user! Luckily, she can use her gaming skills acquired as an otaku to make her way in this new world, but before she knows it, people start calling her the \"Black Healing Hand!\"\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
