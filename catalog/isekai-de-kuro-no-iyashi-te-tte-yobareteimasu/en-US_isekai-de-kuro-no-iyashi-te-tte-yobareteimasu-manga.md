## Sinopse

Walking home one night, Kanzaki Misuzu is dragged into another world by strange, black hands. She awakens in a field and discovers that this world functions like an RPG; there is a status screen, with details concerning her health and mana. In fact, she has an absurdly high amount of mana!

While she is able to manage herself well, it's still a lot to handle, being all alone in the world. After meeting some knights, she soon realizes a use for her modern-day knowledge—healing. Knowing how the body works down to its very cells, Kanzaki is able to discern illnesses and treat them.

Quickly making a name for herself as an unparalleled healer—earning the title "Black Healer"—Kanzaki sets out on an adventure in this fantastical world, searching for a way home and, all the while, unraveling the truth behind the mysterious man in her dreams.
