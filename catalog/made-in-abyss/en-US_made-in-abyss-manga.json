    "sinopse": "The Abyss, a hole of unprecedented depth—one young girl and a robot brave its dangers to find the truth.\n\nThe town of Orth is a special one, as it is built around the edges of the massive Abyss, a wonder which has never been fully explored. Those who venture too far down never return, but those brave enough to traverse its territories are known as \"Cave Raiders\" and are heralded as legends. Within this town lives a young girl called Riko, the child of one of the most famous Cave Raiders of all time who disappeared on an expedition many years ago.\n\nOne day, Riko's life changes when she meets a strange robot called Regu, who seems to appear from within the Abyss. Believing this to be a sign from her mother stuck at the bottom of the Abyss, Riko descends into its depths with Regu, ready to confront all the dangers within it.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
