## Sinopse

The youngest daughter who worries about completely pointless things. The super indecisive middle daughter. The extremely annoying, lip smacking eldest daughter. Starting with these three sisters, this is a story about lovable, clumsy people. A short slice of life comedy that surprisingly has nothing to do with the universe!
