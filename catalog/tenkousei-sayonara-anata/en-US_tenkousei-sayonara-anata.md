After his parent's divorce, Kazuo Saito moves with his mother from Onomichi and must leave his girlfriend behind. At his new school, Kazuo is surprised to reunite with his childhood friend Kazumi. He feels embarrassed around Kazumi, who talks about their early childhood stories without any reserve. One day, Kazumi invites Kazuo to her house.
