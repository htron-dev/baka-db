## Sinopse

Yuki Tsukigawa is a bartender operating out of her very own portable bar: a small cart with wheels that changes location every night. Attracting customers that are dealing with all kinds of issues, Yuki serves cocktails that not only provide an unforgettable taste, but leave a lasting impression on their hearts as well, gradually easing her patrons of their worries.
