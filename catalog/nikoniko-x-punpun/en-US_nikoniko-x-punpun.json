    "sinopse": "Ootani Rin, a girl from a poor family due to her father's gambling, is attending a high school on a scholarship. She has been taking care of her sisters and mother ever since her father ran away. Her school doesn't allow its students to work part time, but she's not worried about it since all the students at her school are rich. However, one boy takes an interest in her, and finds out about her part-time job. To keep him quiet, she has to make him a bento.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots: Bukiccho☆Boukun, Totsugeki!
