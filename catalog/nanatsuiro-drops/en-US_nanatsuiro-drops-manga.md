## Sinopse

Tsuwabaki, a normal school boy, accidentally switches his drink with that of a man with dog ears. It turns him into a small sheep at night, and his only hope for a normal life again is from a chosen girl who will find and catch the 7 Stardrops. The catch is that he can not tell her who he really is.
