## Sinopse

Tsubasa Natsukawa has just moved from Tokyo to Hokkaido, in the middle of winter. Not quite appreciating how far apart towns are in the country, he gets off the taxi at the next town over from his destination so he can see the sights around his home. But he is shocked when he learns the "next town" is a 3 hour walk away. But he also meets a cute Dosanko (born and raised in Hokkaido) gyaru named Minami Fuyuki who is braving negative 8 degree weather in the standard gyaru outfit of short skirts and bare legs!
