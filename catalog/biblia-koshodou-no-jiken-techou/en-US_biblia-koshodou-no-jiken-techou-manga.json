    "sinopse": "Shinokawa Shioriko, a young owner of a bookstore in Kamakura, loves old books. Separate from the contents of the book, they each have their own story, slowly built as they pass from one person to another. Shioriko loves learning the stories of each old book that comes her way. Gora Daisuke was just scared off of books by his grandmother, an avid collector. When he got into her library one day as a child, she responded angrily and violently. Now his grandmother is dead, and it's time to deal with her belongings. He comes across the complete works of Natsume Soseki, which appear to be autographed! When he is eventually directed to Shioriko to ask about it, she responds with so much more than a simple answer about the signature. As he sees Shioriko's enthusiasm, it looks like knowing Shioriko might lead Daisuke to a new path toward appreciating books!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
