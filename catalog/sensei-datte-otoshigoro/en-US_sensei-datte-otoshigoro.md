## Sinopse

This is the story of a 20-year-old girl named Itano Kayo. She is in the process of making her dream of becoming a teacher come true. She is very nervous and excited. Kayo is a small and cute girl. She looks more like a student than a teacher. She has dreamed of being a teacher ever since she was a small child. Since the moment when a teacher saved her when she was being bullied by some boys in her class, she has wanted to be a good teacher like that and to help kids.

All this enthusiasm may be great, but the true is that when it comes to facing actual students, things get off to a bumpy start. On her way to her classroom, she spots a guy sneaking out of the infirmary window. Thinking that he is trying to cut class, she goes to confront him about his behavior, but her nerves show up, and she doesn’t sound as confident as she should. And wow, the student is really handsome and he doesn’t seem intimidated by Kayo’s authority at all. what will happen with this encounter...
