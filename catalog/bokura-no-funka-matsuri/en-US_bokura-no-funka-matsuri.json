    "sinopse": "When a local volcano erupts, the depopulated town of Kanematsu suddenly thrives as a hot-springs resort. High-school student Tomiyama, a cool character, can't accept this dramatic transformation, while his friend Sakurajima enthusiastically embraces it. This is the story of how their friendship is affected by changes in their town. The freely-drawn, casual style the manga brings to its portrayal of the shifting emotions of high-school boys has earned it many fans.\n\n(Source: MU)",
