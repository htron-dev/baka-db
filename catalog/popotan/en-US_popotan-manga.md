## Sinopse

A manga adaptation of Petit Ferret's visual novel.

Chris is a high school dropout who dislikes the direction of society and refuses to get a job. He wanders the streets making a living as a guitar-playing busker. He feels he cannot play well without an audience, which is hard to find as a drifter. The game starts as Chris discovers a mansion; he meets three sisters and their maid inside. Chris stays with them because they offer him cheap rent; he soon learns that he'll have to change his wandering ways to be accepted.
