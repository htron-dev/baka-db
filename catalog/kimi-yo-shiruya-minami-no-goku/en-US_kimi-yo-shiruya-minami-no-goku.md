## Sinopse

In 1945, after WWII had ended, many Japanese soldiers had been interned at the P.O.W. camp on "G" island.

Lieutenant Tsubaki, a Japanese prisoner-of-war, steals into the infirmary of the U.S. Army, seeking medicine for one of his men, Corporal Mikami, who is suffering from malaria. Lt. Tsubaki is caught and brought before Major Howard, in command of the camp.

Maj. Howard forces Lt. Tsubaki to become his plaything, in exchange for the medicine, and Lt. Tsubaki has no choice but to succumb to his cruel games. Lt. Tsubaki is increasingly humiliated in diverse ways by Maj. Howard...
