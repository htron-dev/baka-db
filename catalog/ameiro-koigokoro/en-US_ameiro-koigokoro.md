## Sinopse

One rainy day, Yuta Yoshizawa is working at his family's senbei shop when a member of his old high school club, Shizuno, appears. Even though they are merely acquaintances, Shizuno begins visiting the shop every few days, which rekindles Yuta’s secret interest that has been smoldering since high school. The sweetest, sexiest, and most heartwarming story is here! We also present to you a love story that spans 20 years between Shoichi, Yuta’s dependable older brother, and his wild childhood friend, Seigo.
