## Sinopse

An amazing high school soccer player, Amagai Rihito, is making his debut! He intended to enter a high school famed across Japan for its elite soccer team, but a little mix-up with the school name has left him at a school with an incredibly weak team. After the initial shock of discovering this, Rihito decides that he's willing to work to help his weak team become the best in Japan. The only problem is the rest of the existing team is cold and unenthusiastic. Will his challenge to take on the whole team single-handedly break them out of their apathy?
