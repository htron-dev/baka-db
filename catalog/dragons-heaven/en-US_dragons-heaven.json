    "sinopse": "Lately in Shibuya, many high school girls have gone missing but that doesn't stop Yaida Kirin, our guitar slinging, Tae Kwon Do wielding High School Ardor of Justice from venturing into the night to save the poor souls in need of help. It's a simple life for our heroine, but little does she know that a mysterious group of people have joined her bid for justice. Then there's Reido Serujio. What connection does he have with the mysterious group? What is he hiding beneath that weak, timid exterior of his? And why he won't stop following Kirin-san!? Is it love, like Yuki, Kirin's friend, says?\n\n(Source: Aerandria)",
