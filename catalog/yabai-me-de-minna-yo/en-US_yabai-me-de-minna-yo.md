## Sinopse

The person Aiba Misao loves is an onnagata in taishuu engeki, named Yumedono Ginnojou. He fell in love when he saw this person on stage, believing him to be a girl. Thus, when the plain Oosato Ginji is transferred to his school, he fails to recognize him as his much-admired Ginnojou. However, Ginnojou finds love, becomes even more enthralling and makes a big break in a commercial. A long-distance relationship, a frustrating love… Complications turn these two people into adults!

In addition to the title series, also included is a hard love story where East meets West on the streets of New York!
