## Sinopse

Yuugo Hachiken has spent every waking moment of his life studying in order to achieve the highest grades in school. Finally cracking under the pressure of his parents' expectations for success, Yuugo decides to leave his city life and enroll in the rural Ooezo Agricultural High School. However, he has absolutely no experience with farming!

Attempting to utilize the skills he has built through studying, Yuugo begins to pursue the true meaning of having a dream and perhaps discover his own along the way. But life is not as simple as it seems to be, and Yuugo must learn that hardship may appear when you least expect it.
