## Sinopse

Haruzake Nao is a sweet boy who has started work at a flower shop. His cousin, Monjirou, is the intimidating Vice President of the Tadano Group. Since childhood Monjirou has protected Nao from all sorts of trouble.

While Monjirou may harbor secret intentions towards Nao, Nao himself may think of Monjirou as more than just a childhood friend. Monjirou is, after all, his hero!
