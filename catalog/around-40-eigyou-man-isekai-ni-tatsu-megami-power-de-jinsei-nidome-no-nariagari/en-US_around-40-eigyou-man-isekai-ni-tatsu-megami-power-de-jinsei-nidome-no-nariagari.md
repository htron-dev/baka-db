## Sinopse

Thirteen years ago, on a rainy night, Shouzou Onigawara met a woman who quite literally changed his life: a goddess named Silvia. Their initial meeting was riddled with misunderstandings, mostly on Shouzou's part, but from that day onward, Silvia became his loving companion.

In the present day, Shouzou and Silvia are married, have three daughters—Kana, Hina, and Yuna—and live in a beautiful new home. But one day, they and their entire house are suddenly transported to another world rife with monsters, magic, and danger. Due to a malfunction in the transmigration system, they are now stuck in this other world for at least a year! Deciding to make the best of a bad situation, Shouzou gets a job at a local guild and vows to make them the best in the city through his expertise in sales.
