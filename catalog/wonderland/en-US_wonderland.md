## Sinopse

When humans en masse shrink down to a tiny size, a girl named Alice and her pup Poco find themselves struggling to survive. Surrounded by strange yet familiar sights, they work to make a new life. That's easier said than done, however, in a world that's bigger–and more dangerous–than ever.
