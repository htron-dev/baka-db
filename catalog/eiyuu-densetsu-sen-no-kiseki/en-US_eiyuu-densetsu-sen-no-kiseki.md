## Sinopse

Based on RPG game by the same title.

The game takes place in the Erebonian Empire within the same time frame as Zero no Kiseki and Ao no Kiseki. The game's plot is centered around the newly formed special class "Class VII" in Thors Military Academy, composed of both aristocrats and common Erebonian citizens. Class VII is the only class in the entire academy that does not segregate the two different social classes.

The game follows Class VII throughout their school year, mainly around the times when Class VII receive special field training that takes them all over Erebonia. Throughout their training across Erebonia, Class VII matures and casts aside their preconceptions of the two social classes as well witness first hand the reality of empire; the power struggle between the aristocracy led by the four noble houses, and the working class reformists led by Iron Blood Chancellor of Erebonia, Giliath Osborne which threatens to lead to a civil war.
