## Sinopse

Upon entering Takamanohara Academy Waka meets Moriya, a strange boy who seems to know him, though the feeling isn't mutual. Despite not knowing who Moriya is, Waka feels a strange pull to him. When he gets an invitation to the mysterious "Gentleman's Meeting" he can't help but be fascinated and a little worried all in one. Upon entering the Shrine's archways, Waka's future becomes increasingly unclear. (SourceL Corrupted Fetishes)
