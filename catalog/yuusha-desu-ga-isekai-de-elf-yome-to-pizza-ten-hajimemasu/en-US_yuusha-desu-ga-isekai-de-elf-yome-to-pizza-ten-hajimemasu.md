## Sinopse

The hero died when he was thrown off his pizza delivery bike. When he's about to be reborn into a new world, the goddess tasked with his reincarnation lets him choose between three options: he can be heroic swordsman, a wizard, or hero that saves the world with pizza. He takes so long to decide that the first two options are taken by other people and he's stuck with the third. He's reborn in an elf country as the "high-calorie hero." Equipped only with the power of pizza, he hires the appetite demon lord's daughter Liria to help him run the pizza parlor.
