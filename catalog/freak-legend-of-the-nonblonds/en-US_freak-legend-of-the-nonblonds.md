## Sinopse

Come and meet some totally new bounty hunters who are nothing like you've ever seen before! They are the "Nonblonds": Terbulton, who can take away your powers simply by putting his hand on your head, Verna, who can hack into almost anything, and Lorel, the hypnotist and the leader of the group. There's nothing they won't do, and nothing they can't do! And of course, their bounty targets are no ordinary folks either!
