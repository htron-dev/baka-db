## Sinopse

16-year-old Ritsu has a busy life. She is a high school student, but she also spends all her extra time helping her mother by delivering udon and ramen for a restaurant. Her life changes when she during an udon delivery, she walks into a den of Yakuza. Flustered by meeting this rough group, Ritsu delivers the food in a hurry, and rushes out the door. She doesn’t notice that she has captured the attention of the group’s leader. Still shaken by her meeting with the Yakuza, Ritsu is further shocked when their leader walks into the restaurant, returns Ritsu's delivery box, and asks her out! Ritsu is understandably wary of him. He’s a dangerous guy! But he is really cute, and is awfully determined… how can she refuse? Thus begins an interesting relationship between the delivery girl and gangster!
