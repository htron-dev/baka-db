## Sinopse

Yutaka Hozumi has always been bad at eating in the company of others, with people complaining that his presence makes mealtimes boring and food taste bad. While eating lunch alone one day, he is suddenly approached by a hungry little boy to whom he hands over the onigiri from his meal. When the boy's older brother shows up, Yutaka is introduced to Tane and Minoru Ueda—a pair of siblings with a significant age gap.

When Yutaka meets the brothers again, they ask to learn how to make his special rice balls; little Tane insists that they were the best he had ever eaten. Succumbing to Tane's adorable pleas and his own fear of the intimidating Minoru, Yutaka agrees to become their cooking teacher.

As lessons morph into meals, Yutaka and the siblings grow closer—but Tane and Minoru's close bond draws out uncomfortable memories for Yutaka, and there are feelings lurking beneath the surface of these group meals that were not initially apparent.
