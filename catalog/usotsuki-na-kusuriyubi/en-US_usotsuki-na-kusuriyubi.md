## Sinopse

There is a reason why Jane wears a ring on the ring finger of her left hand. Because of her good looks, she has had male coworkers going after her and, in the end, she was forced to resign. So she came up with a strategy to pretend to be married. Her best friend tries to stop her by asking "What are you going to when you meet your Mr. Right?" But she didn't think true love would find her any time soon... Jane joins a new company and lies about her marital status, and she falls in love with the CEO. She lies that she has a nice husband who looks like Tom Cruise, and now she cannot take her words back...!
