## Sinopse

Despite the fact her mother's a model, (famous for being on the magazine Charisma Housewife), Sae's usually left home alone. And although she has what classmates call a 'sub-space stomach', Sae can't cook. In an attempt to help a friend with her love, Sae becomes closer with a classmate named Yuuki, who works at a cafe. Will Sae actually learn to cook? Will this closeness develop into a one or two-sided love?
