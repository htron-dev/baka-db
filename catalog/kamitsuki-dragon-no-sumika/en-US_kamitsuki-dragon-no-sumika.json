    "sinopse": "Haruta is teased for being a playboy ladies' man and heartbreaker after resigning from his previous workplace when he fell in love with his boss' girlfriend. He just wanted an ordinary life, ordinary happiness, and ordinary love, but it seems he's out of luck. Haruta moves to an apartment complex owned by his friend, Hatake, for his new job. He meets Sousuke Azumi, a talented glass artist who was a previous acquaintance of his back in their academy days. The two were amicable at first. That is until Sousuke tries manipulating Haruta into making a move on Michiyo, Hatake's girlfriend. It turns out, Sousuke has feelings for Hatake. Embarrassed and angry, Haruta confronts Sousuke. Thus begins their complicated relationship.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
