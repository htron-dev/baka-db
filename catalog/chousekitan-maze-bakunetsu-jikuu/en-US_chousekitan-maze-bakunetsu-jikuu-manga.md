## Sinopse

A girl wakes up to find her room a mess. She realizes that she has partially lost her memory. All she can remember is that her name is Maze, and that she's now in a strange world. Her house landed on some creatures just like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. Where she meets a girl named Princess Mill who is on the run from the "Jaina Holy Group"; Maze also soon realizes that at night she transforms into a man. Maze and Mill meet more companions on their journey and become embroiled in a war to defeat Jaina and raise Mill back to the throne of Bartonia.
