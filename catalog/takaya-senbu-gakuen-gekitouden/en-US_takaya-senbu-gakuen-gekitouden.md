## Sinopse

Homura Takaya parents went bankrupt and received a large sum of money from their neighbor, the Shirakawas, one the worlds most distinguished and richest family. The only condition is that Takaya will go to the same school that his childhood friends, Shirakawa Nagisa and her older brother Shou, attends. But this is no ordinary school. Only strong people are in this school and their only rule is "power". Being slightly below average, Takaya must train himself to stay alive in this school.
