## Sinopse

Matsui Ichimatsu, Haruno Koume, and Sanguubashi Takezou are old friends with one thing in common: despite their good looks, they're incredibly unpopular with the ladies. But what does Polaris have to do with their fate? Who's that strange girl? And what does Nobuyuki Anzai (author of Flame of Recca and MAR) have in store for us this time?
