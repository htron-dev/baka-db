## Sinopse

"I'll be your slave."

Lonely high school student Youhei doesn't belong to anywhere, be it his home or his school. That time, he ran into Ryou, a classmate who is also an ace in soccer club. The two were gradually drawn to each other, but... After an accident, their relationship was changed significantly. That was the beginning of a distorted pure love that would last for several years later...

"I'll do housework, I'll drop you off, pick you up. I'll have sex with you. I'll do anything Ryou wants. Everything, as long as I can be with Ryou."
