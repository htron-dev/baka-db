    "sinopse": "Echizen, a game developer known to make the hardest of games to the point that they were near impossible to complete, earned himself the title of the \"God Trapper\". However, he quits the company when he isn't allowed to do what he's best at: Building traps. His destiny then takes another sudden turn when he is transported to another world which most would describe with the word „hell\". He meets the Demon king's daughter and manages to obtain her power, turning him into a true \"God Trapper\". From there his journey in this new world, he perceives as heaven, begins.\n\n(Source: MU)",
