    "sinopse": "Resine de Poisson, orphan heir of an incredibly wealthy family, decides to attend the same boarding school as her late mother. However, due to her sheltered upbringing, she struggles to fit in. It doesn't help that she is put in the same room as the rebellious Simone d'Arc, who does nothing but tease and laugh at her.\n\nHowever, after fate decides to put the two in the leading roles of a school performance of Romeo and Juliet, the bond between them grows. Shiroi Heya no Futari explores the confusing relationship between a feminine goody-two-shoes and a tomboyish troublemaker.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
