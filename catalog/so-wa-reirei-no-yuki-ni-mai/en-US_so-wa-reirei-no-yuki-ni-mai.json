    "sinopse": "This story in set in the Taisho era (1912-1926).\n\nTwo years after the famous author Uro vanished, his last manuscript is found at the house of competing author Otogai, who seems obsessed with (or is it possessed by?) his supposedly-dead rival. By a strange turn of events, three acquaintances; an illustrator, an editor and a stage performer, end up investigating Otogai's odd behaviour. They discover that the writer's garden appears to be haunted by a mysterious camellia bush...and camellia was Uro's favourite flower.\n\n(Source: MU)",
