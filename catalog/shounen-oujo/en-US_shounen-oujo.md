## Sinopse

In the former kingdom of Morrigan, countless lives were lost due to war and rebellion alike. When women usurped all positions of power, new laws dictated that only they could earn income and receive inheritances, while men lost the majority of their rights and were reduced to mere objects of scorn. Morrigan became a queendom wrapped in an illusory peace. Outside of the royal court, especially, the people continued to suffer; however, now the men were subjected to the worst of the pain and humiliation.

Albert is a young orphan living near Morrigan's harbor. One day, despite warnings from his guardian Martha, he and his friend Theodore head toward the town's center to observe preparations for the Queen's birthday festival. Unsurprisingly, as they are boys unaccompanied by an adult, they are captured by slave traders and immediately readied to be sold. An elegantly dressed man offers an exorbitant price in order to purchase them both—though he clearly displays a preference for Albert.

Introducing himself as Guy Schwarzwald, the man transports Albert and Theodore to a palace where they are to meet their new master. Albert is unsure what surprises him more—that he is now the property of Princess Alexia Lumiere, heir apparent to the throne, or that somehow she looks exactly like him!
