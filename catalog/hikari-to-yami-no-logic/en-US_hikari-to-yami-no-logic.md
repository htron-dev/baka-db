## Sinopse

Sakura Kazuki is a telepath who can sense negative emotions such as malice through contact. Despite his cute 17-year-old appearance, he’s in fact a rookie detective in the police force, Division One. Teamed with his seasoned, assertive partner/mentor, Shido-san, Sakura often works undercover. His disguises consist of a high school boy, an office lady, and he even gets to wear a cat suit!? Cosplay in the police force!? A thrilling love story.
