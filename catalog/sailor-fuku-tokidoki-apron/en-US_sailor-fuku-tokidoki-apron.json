A little away from this station, deep in a quiet suburban town, is the apartment her grandfather built. That's right—starting today, Honoka is going to be a landlord! Wearing her sailor school uniform by day and her landlord's apron after school, Honoka sets out to manage this building... which happens to be home to some very beautiful women. What kinds of heart pounding, exciting adventures await Honoka?!\n\n(Source: Manga Box)",
