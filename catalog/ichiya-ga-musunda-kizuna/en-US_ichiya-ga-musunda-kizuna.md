## Sinopse

She gave him one last chance, and her life changed forever!

Justina can't believe Dante D'Arezzo had the gall to talk to her! Has he forgotten what he did? Yet Justina's heart wavers after she is unexpectedly reunited with Dante, an Italian entrepreneur and her ex-fiancé. She still hasn't healed from his betrayal five years ago, but when he whispers sweetly to her, she's captivated by his wild eyes. Why is he trying to get involved with her again? Justina decides to spend one last night with him, unable to resist his charms, but it ends up leaving her with a secret she can never tell him...
