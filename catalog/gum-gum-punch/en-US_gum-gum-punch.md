## Sinopse

"Gum Gum Punch" is a Manga for small children depicting the adventures of a boy called Punch and his sister Pinko who experience many things with magic chewing gum.

One day, the god of gum appears before Punch and Pinko and gives them magic chewing gum that is capable of producing anything. Seeing that they are trying to blow gum but can't, the god of gum sends his disciple, Gum Gum, to the children to teach them.

But Punch is always teasing Gum Gum because he is so small. Next, another disciple called Kucha-kucha is called in to help Gum Gum. Together, they create monsters, get a powerful typhoon drunk and enjoy a variety of adventures. (Source: tezukaosamu.net)
