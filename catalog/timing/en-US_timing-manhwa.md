## Sinopse

Ja-gi Park, a high school teacher and diviner, wakes up from a vivid dream foreseeing a mass suicide set to happen in 10 days. It's up to her and a group of time manipulators to help prevent this tragic fate from happening before time runs out. However, as days pass by and mysteries unravel, Ja-gi realizes there's more to her premonition than meets the eye.
