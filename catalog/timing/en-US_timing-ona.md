## Sinopse

The Japanese-Korean horror movie should have been released in 2012, but the project got canceled after Korean investors could not be determined. A six-minute promotional video is what's left of it of this attempted co-production.

Timing holds the story of four characters with abilities related with time, fighting to stop the tragedies occurring in a high school.
