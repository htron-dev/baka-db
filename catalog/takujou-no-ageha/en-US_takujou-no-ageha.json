    "sinopse": "Meet Ageha, a promising successor to Japan's golden age of table tennis. He's under the tutelage of a former world champion whose granddaughter Ririka is also at the top of her game—though she's playing a more seductive sport. Both would rather die than recognize the other's talents, which is going to get interesting when they find out they're engaged!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Takujou no Ageha (pilot)",
