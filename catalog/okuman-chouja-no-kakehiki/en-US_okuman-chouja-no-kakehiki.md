## Sinopse

Married to the boss... because of his baby...

Hebe can't believe she's ended up in her handsome boss's bed. But it seems Nick Cavendish just needed to be with someone on the anniversary of his young son's death.

Nick tries to dismiss Hebe in the same way he has all his women. But that's not so easy when Hebe's his assistant and she's got morning sickness! Nick has a change of heart: he's been sent a second chance at fatherhood! But Hebe's heart is breaking, being married as she is for the baby's sake.
