This volume contains two short stories, each two chapters long, by Sato Shio.

Shinzou no Nai Kyojin:
On the giant space ship Exculsus, King Kravitz and his queen, Clara, maintain rule over a very large population of permanent ship residents. Among Kravitz's responsibilities is to produce offspring with the ship's women, but his failure to produce a child with the queen has led to tension and disquiet on board. The queen's purchase of a strange telepathic blue-eyed monkey temporarily lightens the mood, but is her care of such a foreign animal truly safe to her and her people?

Babylon Made Nan Mile?:
The Star Festival, held only once every 7 years, is famous for attracting VIPs from all over the galaxy who want to see the strange and exciting attractions gathered in the city of Takitsusu. The police are put on high security alert, but the beautiful mayor's wife is found murdered anyway. Who is behind her death and why?
