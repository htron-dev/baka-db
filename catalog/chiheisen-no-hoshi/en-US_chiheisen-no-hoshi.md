## Sinopse

Sorao escaped from the youth reformatory and met a young, inarticulate potter named Shiyo. Sorao refuses to talk about his past and Shiyo spends most of his time shutting himself in his house.

From the peaceful everyday life, the two began to know about each other's past a little by little, and their affection for each other started growing as well. An impactful, sensitive story between two boys starts here!
