## Sinopse

In the year 2008, high school girl Sakura Minamoto is abruptly killed in a traffic accident. Ten years later, Sakura, along with six "legendary" girls from various eras of Japan's history, are brought back as zombies by a man named Koutarou Tatsumi, who seeks to save the Saga prefecture by putting together an all-zombie idol group.
