## Sinopse

Kunio Tokiwa, a spontaneous and gifted pianist, has always been motivated by his desire to please his uncle, a piano tuner. When his uncle dies, Kunio is lost. The night he’s about to give up the piano entirely, Kunio is stunned by the sound of a piano tuned and played by the beautiful Yui Hasegawa. Reminded of his beloved uncle, Kunio devotes himself to gaining both Yui’s exclusive service and his approval. Not even Yui’s cold, mystifying behavior can stop Kunio’s efforts, but he keeps hitting sour notes in his clumsy struggles to figure out why Yui’s existence is so important to him. When Kunio’s words create confusion and hurt, he must find another way to communicate. Can Kunio’s Healing Music convince Yui that he’s not a replacement for Kunio’s uncle and bring them together for an unforgettable, lifelong duet?
