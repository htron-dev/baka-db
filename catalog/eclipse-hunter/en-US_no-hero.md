## Sinopse

Daren Avery and Charles have the fated arrangement of master and servant. In the depths of darkness, Dari scooped up the butler, Charles—a vampire. Possessing a fervid passion for service, Charles single-mindedly attends the secretive young master Dari—regardless of his ferocious appetite, abhorrent taste in clothing, and relationships failings—for the master is always right. On the other hand, in the chaotic era of scientifically enhanced humans, powerful heros become the protectors of normal citizens, going where evil needs subduing. This younger master may be secretive, but he is our hero.
