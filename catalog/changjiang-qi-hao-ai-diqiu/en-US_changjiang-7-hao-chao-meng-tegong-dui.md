## Sinopse

Zhou Xiaodi (voiced by Xu Jiao) and Dad Zhou (played by Shi Banyu), Alien Dog Qizai (voiced by Lin Yan), and Big Fat Dog Chocolate (voiced by Jian Yaozong) live a happy life together. One day, they met Alien Confusion Warrior 88 in an abandoned amusement park. The confused warrior told Zhou Xiaodi that at this time, the star demon King Jin Baobao (voiced by Ma Yufei) was about to move. It planned a conspiracy called "Dark Food Project" to dominate the earth by this, and the responsibility of the confused warrior was to defeat Golden baby, protect the earth.
　　 Zhou Xiaodi decided to help the confused warriors. They learned that a long-lost ancient book recorded the secret weapon that could defeat the golden baby, so the group embarked on a journey to find the ancient book. Along the way, what stories of laughter and tears await them?
