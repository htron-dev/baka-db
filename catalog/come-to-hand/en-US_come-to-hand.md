## Sinopse

Overworked schoolteacher, Miharu, collapses onto the icy roads. Along comes local tattoo artist, Arashi to save the day. However, it being Miharu's first time seeing so many tattoo's up close, he unintentionally makes some insensitive comments. To apologize, Miharu goes to his shop to apologize, where he realizes just how kind Arashi is. He feels comfortable chatting to someone of the same age, but also feels like something doesn't seem right...
