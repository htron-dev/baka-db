## Sinopse

By all appearances, Sakura and her friends are normal, albeit sheltered junior high school girls who enjoy talking about love and walking home from school together. However, they also happen to inhabit a strange and supernatural world populated by mysterious, gigantic beings and unusual plant and animal life. Amid their peaceful lives, Sakura becomes very interested in something only alluded to exist in an old book: dicks.
