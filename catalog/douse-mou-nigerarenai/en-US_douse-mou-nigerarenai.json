    "sinopse": "Invited by a friend to a drinking party, Ryou reunites with Fujishiro, a man he's hated since childhood. His ability to socialize with anyone remains unchanged. Remembering his irritation towards Fujishiro being liked by everyone surrounding him, he decides not to get involved, but... When they were left alone, Fujishiro poked at his true feelings saying \"you hate me, don't you?\" And confessing he \"likes\" Ryou, the only person who hates him. He pushed him down and came on to him. Is Fujishiro just playing with Ryou...?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
