## Sinopse

Takahashi has a one-sided love for Shige, the blue-collar who lives next door. The one who gave him the chance to fall in love was his nephew, Haru. Haru was left unable to speak from a trauma of child neglect, but Shige's warm presence is what saved him. Unable even to confess, "I want you to be my big brother too..," Takahashi's feelings only became stronger. But then he's seen by Shige while kissing a sex friend in the car!?
