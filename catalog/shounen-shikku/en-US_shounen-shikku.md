## Sinopse

Ootori Haruki was the ace of his school's soccer team and spent a lot of time and effort doing things specifically to look cool. He'd been filling the role he chose for himself pretty well, until the transfer student Jinmyou Kaoru came along. Not only did Kaoru have the natural "cool" look and act down, he also seemed to be effortlessly better than Haruki at soccer. Will Haruki be able to rise to the challenge of his new rival?
