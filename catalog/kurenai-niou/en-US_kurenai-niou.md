## Sinopse

Yoshida Tamako was the youngest of 11 children. When she turned 3, she was taken to the Gion district of Kyoto by the Okami of a traditional Maiko/Geiko house. It is there that Tamako changes her name to Sakiko and begins her long journey to become one of the top maiko in Gion history, "Sakuya". Another wonderful work by Yamato Waki-sensei that details the beauty of Kyoto and traditional Japan and let's us also see into the often secret world of Kyoto's maikos and geikos.
