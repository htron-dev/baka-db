## Sinopse

Takumi Suzuki, kind of a loner at school and a hardcore pop star fan (and an amateur singer himself) inadvertently uncovers Misaki Hayakawa's secret. Misaki, being the most popular guy at school (as well as Takumi's crush), has to stop this secret from getting out at all costs. As leverage, he makes Takumi dress up as a girl and takes photos of him like this... It's mortifying, but at the same time, it's incredibly exciting... For some reason, Misaki kisses Takumi, and that's when Takumi loses it. He pounces on Misaki, and has his way with him! Takumi apologizes profusely after the deed is done, but Misaki tells Takumi he'd been saving himself for a pop star... The only way Misaki will ever forgive him is if he makes Misaki's dreams come true by becoming a real pop star!!! A geeky, hardcore pop star fan (who's actually a cross-dressing pop star!!) and the most popular guy at school in a heart-thumping pop star romance.
