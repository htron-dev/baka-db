    "sinopse": "Meet Misa, your regular 'career-woman' who works at a trading company. Being the professional that she is, Misa always gives everything her best. Moreover, she's a complete babe!! But even though she has what it takes to be on top at work...when it comes to love, she has absolutely no skills. Misa can't act cute and she's way too prideful... Guys keep flocking to her but in the end it never works out... Her best friend and roommate, Chihiro, however, is her complete opposite. And to add to the insult she does have a steady boyfriend. So what happens when one day this seemingly boring life changes completely when Misa finally meets her dream guy and Chihiro finds out her fiancée has been cheating on her...?!\n\n(Source: MU)",
