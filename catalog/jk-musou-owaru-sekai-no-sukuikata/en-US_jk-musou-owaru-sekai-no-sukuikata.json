    "sinopse": "Creatures that were supposed to exist only in fiction were running rampant throughout the world, drawing civilization close to its demise. That day, I, the protagonist, noticed that there was a special skill dwelling within me.\n\nLeveling up the more she fights and gaining new skills as well as the ability to harness magic in turn, a high school girl who was once a shut-in was integrated into a group of people the system labels as \"players.\" She makes the decision to exterminate the monsters and save the people around her, enjoying the laid-back life the end of the world has brought her all the while.\n\n(Source: MU)",
