## Sinopse

For just one night, shy Tina wishes she could be a woman who is confident and attractive. So when she meets a devilishly handsome man at Carnival in Venice, she casts caution to the wind and gives her virginity to him. They remain masked and spend an enchanted night together. But the very next morning when Tina peeks underneath his mask while he sleeps, she discovers her brother's rival—Nico! Shocked by the irony of fate, she runs away without a word only to find, two months later, that she is carrying his baby!
