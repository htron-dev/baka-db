    "sinopse": "Faith, Fiorenzo's secretary, is to accompany Fiorenzo to a party as his date. Fiorenzo is a five-time world-title holder in cycling and also manages a bike company. Furthermore, he is a globe-trotting playboy. In contrast, she is very plain and doesn't think that they are a good match. She also doesn't really know much about high society, or want to draw any attention to herself. with little confidence, Faith allows Fiorenzo to take her to a beauty parlor and boutique. To give her the appearance of a date worthy of him, they dress her up gorgeously. He's so taken with her transformation that he kisses her!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
