## Sinopse

When jealousy turns into love...

Charlotte is a lawyer who has just lost her business and home, only to then be dumped by her fiancé. To pay off her debts, she starts working at a local law firm led by Daniel, a big-shot lawyer. She thought she was going to work independently, but to her surprise, Daniel wants her to be his personal assistant! Charlotte feels like he doesn't trust her abilities as a lawyer and wants to keep an eye on her. Loved by everyone and an accomplished lawyer, Daniel seems like he has the perfect life. However, Charlotte learns that he inherited his grandmother’s successful business and it makes her resent him even more. Clearly Mr. Perfect had everything handed to him on a plate, unlike her! Or...did he?
