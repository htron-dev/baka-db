## Sinopse

I walk in a different world with my strongest management and smithing ability!

I belonged to the management team of MMORPG "Armed Edda," and when I awoke one day, I was embraced by a red-haired girl in a strange world. What's more, my figure and ability are exactly like the game's debugging character, Blacksmith Laguna Smith, and the girl Rein who helped me is the legendary weapon "Reyvatein" that I trained in the game! When I live, I start to explore the mysteries of the world...!? Using a trained Legendary weapon as a bride, fantasy begins!
