Brooke goes to Normandy to persuade her sister to come back and meets the man she has a one-sided love for. He's a prominent businessman living in an old castle, with striking black hair and gray eyes. He's also puzzled by her sister's feelings for him. He told Brooke, \"If we pretend to be together, she'll give up and go home!\"\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
