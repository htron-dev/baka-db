## Sinopse

Tora is looking for a job, so he decides to apply for this particular place... What he didn't know is that this place is a Male's Brothel. Here he meets Shiro, the most requested male prostitute. At the beginning Tora feels reluctant to work in this environment, but the vulnerability aura that surrounds Shiro makes him stay, plus he needs the money. Everything goes well at first, they stablish this sort of friendship, but shortly after that, feelings, desires and painful secrets complicates their already fragile relationship...
