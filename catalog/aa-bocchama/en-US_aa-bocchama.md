## Sinopse

Kaede Kuroda, alias Sebastian, lives fulfilling days working as the butler for Japan's leading trading group, Sugasaki Trade Holdings. His only source of headache is the sole heir of the Sugasaki group, his young master, the hikikomori gamer, Tominosuke Sugasaki. Although knowing that this sort of hikikomori lifestyle should not be allowed to continue, Sebastian continues to give in and spoil his cute young master.

One day, Sebastian was summoned by the master and was kicked out to the streets with Tominosuke with the parting words "Do not return until you have made 1 million yen"...?!
