## Sinopse

When rich, gorgeous and heartbroken Keiichiro Kuroda’s ex-lover asks for a loan, he makes a bet with the man: he’ll leave 5 million yen in a park with a sign that reads “Please Use Freely,” and if it gets turned into the police, his ex can borrow the money; if someone takes the money, Keiichiro can finally turn away the man who broke his heart.  But when the first person to spot the money ends up being a handsome young man in trouble, can Keiichiro give up on his quest for revenge and fall in love once more?
