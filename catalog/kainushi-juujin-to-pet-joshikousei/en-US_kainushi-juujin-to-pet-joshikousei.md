## Sinopse

On the way home from school, Kashiwagi Aki is kidnapped and finds herself in a world populated entirely by beastmen. She ends up in a pet store where an overzealous and impulsive wolfman Zinovy becomes infatuated with her and buys her on first sight... Thus begins their strange and chaotic, albeit incredibly cute life.
