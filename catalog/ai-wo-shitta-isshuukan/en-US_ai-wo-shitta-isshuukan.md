## Sinopse

After losing her father at a young age, Jane grew up under less than ideal circumstances, and so she is particularly excited to spend her very first vacation in the French Riviera. But the late bloomer Jane wasn't ready for Xavier Salgado-Lezille! For to the infamous "Prince of Darkness," Jane is nothing more than appetizing prey—and she finds herself falling into his sweet trap.
