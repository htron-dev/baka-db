## Sinopse

If you could return to the day you met, what would the two of you do?

“Ah! Fate is unfathomable like that. Never would anyone be able to guess that such an ordinary encounter could lead to such an extraordinary future. Although our encounter that day contributed to a resplendent future, I sometimes find myself reminiscing about ordinary days. If time could be rewound, would I choose to step foot into that tavern where we met… Ah, no! Even if that tavern had not existed, we would definitely have met anyway, because our encounter was indispensable fate!”
–Bard

“With my blade, I’ll cut the tavern, destiny, and this bastard in half all at the same time.”
–Red Cloak

Female Warrior details the 1st generation of the Twelve Holy Knights from The Legend of Sun Knight.
