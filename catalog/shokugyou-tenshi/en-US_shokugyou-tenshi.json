Can the man overcome the obstacles facing his race and live a normal life?\n\nChapter two tells the tale of a young boy who lives in a land of magic. But his first spellbook turns into a pixie when he opens it!\n\nChapter three is about a young boy forced to abandon his cat when he moves. Upon returning years later, the boy finds himself transported to a strange land full of... cats?\n\nThe final story is about a boy who, in exchange for getting off having to pay a speeding fine, agrees to take an experimental drug.
