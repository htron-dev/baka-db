## Sinopse

Azuma is a skilled French chef working at a top-notch hotel. One day, he's requested to offer his culinary skills at a shop he frequents. Not only are the customers varied of age and profession, but some regular patrons have quite the demand too! Furthermore, a love story instead of a dessert order?! By way of declining the strange request, Azuma inadvertently revealed that he's gay! In addition to that, the editor Kumoi is also having a long-distance lover's tiff here!
