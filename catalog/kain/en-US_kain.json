    "sinopse": "Kain is a story about a blue eyed boy wandering the countryside. He happens to be in a town controlled by \"kidoushi\". These \"kidoushis\" are people from the newborn country of Ren, who have a machine in their body, giving them power equal to an army. The power of the kidoushi is determined by the amount the gigai (the machine) take up in their body.\n\n(Source: BloodySeraphim)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Kain (pilot)\nVolume 3: Forest",
