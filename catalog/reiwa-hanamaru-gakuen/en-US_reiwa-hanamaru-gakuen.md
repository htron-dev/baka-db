## Sinopse

Hanamaru Academy is just like any other all girls' school, but it has one big difference: the lovely, lively ladies that make up its student body are all handsome hunks! From the cute uniforms to their pastimes, these boys live every day of their youth to the fullest. A hidden paradise of "JK Danshi" awaits!
