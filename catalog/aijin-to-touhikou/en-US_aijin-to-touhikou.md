## Sinopse

In order to escape the risk of assassination, the spy Jack Ryder must escort Grand Duchess Eva of Maubourg to England. To keep her identity a secret, Eva must act like she and Jack are a couple, and she is charmed by his good looks, wit and courage. "No matter what the danger, I will come and save you!" Jack's earnest promise has a profound effect on Eva's heart because she had only ever known the life of a marriage without love. But, for him, he is just doing his duty. There's no way that he will actually be in love with her... is there?
