## Sinopse

Mashiro and Natsume are childhood friends. Mashiro has a complex about being too tall and 3 years older than Natsume. She has long loved Natsume, but it's difficult for her to convey her feelings to him. A man who looks just like a grown-up Natsume appears before Mashiro. The man who resembles Natsume confesses unexpectedly that he has long loved Mashiro. Who on earth is he?!
