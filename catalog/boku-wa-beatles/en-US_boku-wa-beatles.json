    "sinopse": "This new series takes us to 2010, where four Japanese students have decided to form a band called The Fab 4, in memory of the Beatles. The plot takes a sudden turn when three of the four protagonists are fighting on the subway and one of them falls to the track, taking with him another.\n\nAt the time, the two musicians realize that they are in a park, just that there was something that did not fit: they were in Japan, but in 1961.",
