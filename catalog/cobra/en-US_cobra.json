    "sinopse": "The series features the infamous space-pirate Cobra who was once forced to hide from enemies by surgically altering his face and erasing his own memory. At the start of the story he is living an ordinary life but after using a dream-machine he starts to regain his memories. Reunited with his android partner Lady Armaroid and his old ship Tortuga, he now faces foes both old and new. The first, and most well-known of the manga stories sees him encountering the Royal sisters whose bodies hold the map to a great treasure.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
