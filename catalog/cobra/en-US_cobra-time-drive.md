## Sinopse

The presence of Lady was becoming hollow. At this rate, she will completely disappear. In order to find the explanation to this cause, Cobra had Time Dived into the past of Lady when she still had a human body. The Sanborn principality had been deprived by the former fortune teller of Gyros and their subordinates. Because of them, the lords of the small countries were living a life under fear. The meeting of Princess Emeralda who was plotting to over throne Gyros and the young pirate Cobra was slowly approaching.
