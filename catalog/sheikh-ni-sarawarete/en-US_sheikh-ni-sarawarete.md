## Sinopse

"If you ever set even one foot in my kingdom...I'll take you away and put you in the world's most beautiful cage!" This is a bittersweet memory of Jasmine's ex-lover, Sheikh Tariq. When she visits his desert homeland, he sweeps her away to his rose-colored palace, as promised. She dreams of reconciling her love for him, but will Tariq's heart want her back without knowing why she left him once before?
