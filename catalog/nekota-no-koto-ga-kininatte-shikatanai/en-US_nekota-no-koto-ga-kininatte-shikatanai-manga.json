    "sinopse": "Transferring often, Mikiko \"Mikki\" Amane maintains an aloof and detached attitude at each new school. However, she is thrown for a loop when she sets eyes on her classmate Nekota. He has the face of a cat! No matter what angle it's viewed from, or how hard it's tugged on, his head looks like a mascot. To make matters worse, Mikki seems to be the only one who finds this strange.\n\nWith her interest piqued, Mikki unravels the mystery behind the cat-faced Nekota, and why only she sees him this way. There is no better way to get close and investigate than to befriend him. For once, the usually indifferent transfer student might just have to make some friends!\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Retake!\nVolume 3: Kumori Sora, Ue no Hou.\nVolume 9: Chounouryoku Shoujo Clane\nVolume 10: Hoshikuzu yori Ai wo Komete",
