Because of this, she stopped making friends or getting deeply involved with people, since she knew she would move again soon. She had lived her life with a cool and uninterested personality, but at her new school, she meets a boy with a cat face. She's so interested in him, she just can't help herself.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
