    "sinopse": "In a city filled with anthropomorphic cat-people, Catman lives free of rules and boundaries, doing everything he wants, which often collides with the other inhabitants of the city. Catman dares to be bold: it’s made in Flash, which is rarely seen nowadays; there are no spoken dialogue but instead is subbed in Japanese and English and has a original soundtrack made in purpose for the series.",
