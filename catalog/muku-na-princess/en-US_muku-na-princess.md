## Sinopse

"Your father just asked me to marry you." These are the words of the handsome man who appeared in front of Gabriella, the heiress to a fortune. He is Prince Ricardo of the principality of Moldoravia. "I won't marry a notorious European playboy!" Luckily, he doesn't want to get married, either, but that fact shakes Gabriella. What dramatic event will bring them together in marriage...?
