## Sinopse

Taku Kinashi's just moved to Tokyo this spring to attend college, with the dream of getting himself a pretty girlfriend and having his first time at last. He just can't wait to finally live alone like he's always wanted. After settling in, he goes to greet his new neighbor, and who should come out of the door but... a smoldering-hot young man with his shirt hanging open displaying his soft, glistening chest and supple thighs! What's more, he seems to know Taku from somewhere...! What happens when a plain old college straight boy like Taku lives under the same roof as an irresistible, exhibitionist flirt like Mitsuru?
