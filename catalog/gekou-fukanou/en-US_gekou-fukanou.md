## Sinopse

Class 2-4 was assigned to prepare for the school culture festival inside the old schoolhouse, known for being a difficult place to prepare in. But suddenly, strange monsters appear and attack the students! They try to run away in a panic, but the way out is locked shut! Inside, one of the students finds an old journal.
