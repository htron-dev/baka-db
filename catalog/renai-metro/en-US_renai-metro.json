The story begins as Nozomi is forced to interact with Atsushi as he commandeers her into breaking up the relationship with Shuusuke (her first love) and Moe (Atsushi's sister). Suffice it to say, things don't go smoothly.\n\n(Source: Batoto)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 3: Pink no Ouji, Ibara no Himegimi",
