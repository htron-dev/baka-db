## Sinopse

Trapped in a a dead-end job, Hayato Hitachi is a psychological wreck until a strange man saves him from drowning in the ocean. That man is none other than Taroi Urashima, a fairytale hero who's been living as Princess Otohime's bed-warmer for a thousand years! In exchange for a change in his fortune, Tarou agrees to take Hayato back to the surface, but when Hayato tries to scold the spoiled man, Tarou is instantly smitten. Hayato tries to use that infatuation to lure Tarou back to land, but Tarou is afraid of returning to human society, so he avoids the subject by pushing Hayato toward the bedroom every time...!! Will Hayato ever make it home, when he's so easily distracted...!?
