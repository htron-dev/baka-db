## Sinopse

Shitara Megumu had been in love with his neighbour, Mitsusawa Ryuuji, for a long time. Afraid of being detested by Ryuuji, Megumu turned his desires to other men. When Ryuuji caught Megumu half-naked lying on the bed, Megumu decided to run away. Years later, they met again when Megumu was a part-time lecturer at Ryuuji's college. Would they finally be together?
