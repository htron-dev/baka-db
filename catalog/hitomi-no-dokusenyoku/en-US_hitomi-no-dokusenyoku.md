## Sinopse

The young model newcomer Shinpei moves into the house with several other male top models on his manager's order. There he meets Ryou, the most popular and seemingly flawless star of the group, who is supposed to watch over him. Shinpei's first thoughts are that he wants to become a great model just like Ryou, but then reality turns out to be very different when Ryou does nothing but treat him badly...
