Labeled as \"Gods of Death\" it is said that whoever glances upon their bewitching night beauty will meet with certain death. Unfortunately for the playboy imperial soldier Gai, such an occurrence earns him a beautiful angel of death named Abel hellbent on taking his life. Then again, having a beautiful girl/boy obsessively chasing after him may not be so bad. Will Gai's expert playboy skills be able to conquer the beautiful Nephilim. Or will Abel succeed in killing the man who saw her true form?\n\n(Source: Amazon)",
