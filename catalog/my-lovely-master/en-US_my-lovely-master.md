## Sinopse

(If I can make money, I will do anything)

I can sell (give up on) my love, or risk my life.
You want to use me as a tool to revenge your little brother [or sister]?
Here, I will be used. Buy me.
I am very expensive.

Eun Hyool, you said you will do anything if you get paid?
I will buy every single piece of you.
From now on, you are my slave.
But, I will refuse your heart.

These two are getting used to each other by endlessly running against each other.
Love that formed through quarrels is risky like a flower at the end of a cliff!
