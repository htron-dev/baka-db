    "sinopse": "(If I can make money, I will do anything)\n\nI can sell (give up on) my love, or risk my life.\nYou want to use me as a tool to revenge your little brother [or sister]?\nHere, I will be used. Buy me.\nI am very expensive.\n\nEun Hyool, you said you will do anything if you get paid?\nI will buy every single piece of you.\nFrom now on, you are my slave.\nBut, I will refuse your heart.\n\nThese two are getting used to each other by endlessly running against each other.\nLove that formed through quarrels is risky like a flower at the end of a cliff!\n\n(Source: MU)",
