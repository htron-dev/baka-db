## Sinopse

In the future, several decades from now, virtual reality gaming has been finally realized. An old man who has always dreamed of VR finally gets the chance to play. After finishing a fun tutorial, the old man indulges in deep emotions while looking back on his life. While enjoying the depth of the game, he begins to notice something strange about the shop owners, and then...he cannot log out?

What is this? Has he been hacked? No, this is the classic "reborn in another world" story!
