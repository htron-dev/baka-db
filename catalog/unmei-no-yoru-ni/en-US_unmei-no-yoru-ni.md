## Sinopse

Miles, the British aristocrat, can't get his mind off Maddie, a woman he met a year ago in Australia on a business trip. He wants her so much that he ends his engagement and heads to her homeland! Meanwhile, Maddie desperately wants to have a child, but doesn't want to be tied down with a husband. All she wants is a sperm donor with brains, looks and class so she could raise the child on her own. Maddie's mind is made up... Or is it?
