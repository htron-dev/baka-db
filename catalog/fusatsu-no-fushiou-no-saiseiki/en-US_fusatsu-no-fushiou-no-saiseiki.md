## Sinopse

A young girl, Mira, on the brink of death due to an epidemic is rescued by the terrifying No Life King, a skeleton of great power. As he continues to help and provide for her and others, the people around him eventually come to trust and rely on him. However, their peaceful life is shattered when the local ruler hears talk about sightings of a powerful undead and dispatches soldiers to put the threat down. Will the No Life King and Mira be able to achieve a world where everyone can live in peace when everyone's first instinct is to either fight them or run away?
