## Sinopse

Naoki gets by on part-time work, and his new job is as a housekeeper. Pinch hitting for his grandmother, who's suffering from a slipped disk, he's dispatched to the home of the super-famous novelist Sengokuhara Hajime. He has more than his fair share of failures to begin with, but Sengokuhara is impressed by Naoki's cooking and begins to warm up to him. Then, one day, a flashy man shows up at Sengokuhara's invitation and the two disappear into the bedroom. When Naoki asks about the sounds of creaking bedsprings, Sengokuhara frankly replies "I'm gay." The flustered Naoki is pushed down by the grinning Sengokuhara, who says, "I'm gonna' make you moan"!
