## Sinopse

Haruko manages a store that sells books and rents DVDs. Her fiance, who worked under her at the store, ends up running off with a young part-timer, and the stressful days just keep adding up. And that's when Tooru appears, looking to get a part-time job at her store. Although he's foolish and probably around half her age, she finds herself gradually falling for him...?
