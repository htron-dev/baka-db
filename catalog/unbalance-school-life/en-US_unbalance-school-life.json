Shinya Sanada spent the beginning on his high school life in a hospital, so he arrives to what he thought was the boys-only dormitory a month late. What's waiting for him is his former childhood friend, although he's much more womanly than he remembers. Shinya decides to adapt to his new life at school.\n\n(Source: MU)",
