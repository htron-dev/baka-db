    "sinopse": "It all started with the suicide of an up and coming female photographer named Hirose Miki. The autopsy revealed that she may have been raped before she threw herself off of the condo balcony. Her fiancé, Kuremi Takeo, a TV producer, is unable to accept her death and begins his own search for the truth of what really happened to Miki. Beginning with one photograph that he finds, Takeo begins to unravel a dark mystery. But the deeper he goes into the abyss, the greater the conspiracy becomes and the more danger he encounters. The thirst for justice and revenge will push Takeo to take on whatever obstacle stands in his way.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
