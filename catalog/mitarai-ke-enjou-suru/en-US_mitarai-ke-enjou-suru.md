## Sinopse

The house of the Mitarai family, who operate a hospital, burned down in an unfortunate incident. The wife who caused the fire in an act of carelessness prostrated herself, apologizing in front of the flames. 13 years later, Anzu Murata is hired as a housekeeper for the Mitarai house. The woman who greets her is the second wife, Makiko. Despite her high standards, Anzu manages to secure a contract for work. However, her true goal is to infiltrate the house.
