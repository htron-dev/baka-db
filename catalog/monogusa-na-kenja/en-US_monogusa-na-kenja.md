## Sinopse

In a world where a variety of peoples live, elves and beastmen, even fairies, there are those that are hated: mixed breeds. Acht, a girl with memories and knowledge of a past life on another world, is such a hated creature. Avoided where she walks, unable to stay at an inn, and no potential places of employment in her future. A life with a mountain of problems, she tries to overcome it with the knowledge from her former life, but when she does... A research loving royal magician, a black-hearted prince, even a pirate captain; a bunch of troublesome people begin to call her a "Sage" and follow her everywhere!
