## Sinopse

In the year 20XX, Colonel Irving of the Army of Allied Nations captures by chance an enemy commander - Lieutenant Yamamoto of the Japanese Imperial Army. One look into Yamamoto’s dark, mysterious eyes and Irving is suddenly intrigued by his Far East beauty. To gain crucial information, Yamamoto is tortured and humiliated by his captor, but it isn’t long before Irving’s interest in his prisoner takes an unlikely turn. Can Irving and Yamamoto, who by fate were destined to become rivals, find a way to break through their barriers? When war is made to make enemies of men, sometimes love is the only thing worth winning.
