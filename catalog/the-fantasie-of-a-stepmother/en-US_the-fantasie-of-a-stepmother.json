    "sinopse": "It is a mystery why the late Marquess Johannes von Neuschwanstein decided to marry a 16-year-old girl barely older than his eldest child. Whatever the reason, Shuli is left to shoulder heavy responsibilities as marchioness after his death. On top of the responsibility to manage a prestigious household with close ties to the empire's royal family, she becomes stepmother to four children who deeply mistrust her.\n\nFor seven years, Shuli dedicates herself to raising the children well and safeguarding the family fortune. She believes she only has to wait until her son Jeremy will take over as head of the family—then she can live freely. However, on the long-awaited day of his wedding, she is caught up in a tragic accident.\n\nWhen Shuli next opens her eyes, she finds herself in the past, hours before Johannes' funeral. Although uncertain why she has been granted a second chance at life, this time she is determined to build relationships with the children as well as allow for her own happiness.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
