The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication have instituted a system that calls for a national census every five years in order to monitor and assess the growing wizard population. Two full-time agents have been assigned to this task by special appointment of the minister, and now must visit each household! Join them in this tale of bureaucratic bungling in a magical land!\n\n(Source: MU)",
