## Sinopse

It's 2029 and virtual reality has taken the center stage in work and in play. Tarou Jin toils away at a convenience store attached to an university hospital, supplementing his income while he tries to get his virtual reality server up and running. His sole consolation is a young resident, Maika Hiiragi, who comes in and orders the same lunch and drink every day. But when he was doing a routine maintenance check on his server, he finds Maika logged in and playing, and working as a waitress?
