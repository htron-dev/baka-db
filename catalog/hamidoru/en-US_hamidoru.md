## Sinopse

Nasuka Promotion Agency is one of the premier talent agencies in Japan, home to many of the top celebrities. However, the female idol group Mushroom consisting of Koyanagi Kasumi, a former child actress, Manami Akari, with a nervous personality, and Asaoka Suzono is far from famous. As a struggling idol unit, they have to deal with sub par jobs while be on the constant look out for that big break. With the help of their managers, Anzai Shinichiro and Amachi Makiko, they just might have what it takes to survive in the world of celebrities.
