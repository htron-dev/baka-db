## Sinopse

What happened to Mr. and Mrs. Osanai, who finally reached their first night of marriage after a pure 10-year dating period...? A romantic comedy where the love of a married couple is tested, featuring the husband—a Katabuzu elementary school teacher—and his wife who is too cute (in a troubled sense). ♪
