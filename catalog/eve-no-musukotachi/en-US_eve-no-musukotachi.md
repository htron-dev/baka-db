## Sinopse

Slapstick homosexual comedy. The protagonists are three British men: Justin (a rock singer), Heath (a macho pianist) and Virgil (a hedonistic poet). Heath and Virgil are gay, and they are forever making passes at the androgynous Justin, who complains about it all the time but eventually stays with them because they all belong to the same tribe called "Vin Rose", the descendents of men created from the rib bone of Eve instead of Adam. The story is about the three transported to the weird, crazy world of Vin Rose, which is populated with historical and/or fictitious characters, most of them either gay or lesbian. (Source: M-U)
