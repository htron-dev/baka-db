## Sinopse

Nanami transfers to St. Marivel (Mary Bell) High School from America as she looks for her childhood friend, Kotaro. In a school where the ratio of male students to female students is 1:20 respectively, Nanami gets involved in a conflict with a male student who is almost twice her size. As Nanami was about to engage in battle, she catches a glimpse of Kotaro and stops, allowing the male student to grab hold of her! How will she get out of this situation?
