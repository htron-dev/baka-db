    "sinopse": "Two stories that mix animation with naniwabushi (storytelling accompanied by shamisen playing). One is a tale of General Nogi, the famous suicide, visiting the shrines at lse on his way to Nagoya, while his wife is mistaken for a commoner as she books into a hotel.\n\nThe second story is of a sumo wrestling trainee, ridiculed by his fellows, who trains hard and avenges himself-the standard cliches of a sports anime, just with plink-plonky music on top of it.\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)",
