## Sinopse

Playboy Ryouya met the cold Io in one of their college group parties. While trying to be friendly, Ryouya was suddenly taken aback when Io commented that he stunk. It turned out that Io has a strong sense of smell, and he told Ryouya his natural scent was actually erotic. Things went off after that, and the two find themselves in a relationship. Ryouya finds himself loving Io too much, but sometimes, he can't help but be unsure of how Io really feels.
