## Sinopse

At the beginning of the picture, one hand placed the stylus on the record with dogs and Kung Fu rabbits. With the classic melody of "Two Tigers", a new battle is about to begin. This time, the painter set a carrot trap on the desk. As long as the Kung Fu Rabbit greedily walks towards the carrot, he will definitely be caught under the bowl. The painter is determined to win, holding a telescope and staring at the trap from a distance, waiting for an exciting moment. Surprisingly, the unlucky Caibao dog fell into the trap, while the artist was rectified by the sudden appearance of Kung Fu Rabbit. The painter became angry and ordered the dog to attack the Kung Fu Rabbit, but Cai Baoguo, who had been defeated repeatedly, failed again without any suspense.
　　 The defeated dog that came back with its tail clipped was mercilessly humiliated by the painter. For the sake of shame, Cai Baogu was thrown into hell-like special training...(translated from douban)
