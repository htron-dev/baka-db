## Sinopse

On a quiet day, the painter was listening to music while creating. He just hung up the phone and turned to the job at hand. In just two strokes, a thin but very clever rabbit is on the paper. The funny painter drew an apple above the rabbit's head. The apple hit the rabbit's head, while the painter gloated. The Kung Fu Rabbit with stunts didn't want to suffer any more. He quickly dodged the painter's rough red line, dived into the water, and overpowered the menacing fish in threes and then jumped out of the water cup. Of course, the painter would never allow such a disobedient cartoon character in his pen, and he drew a vicious dog. The dog barked and rushed towards the Kung Fu Rabbit.
　　 Rabbit is small, but he never surrenders easily. He ran all the way, passing various obstacles, not only defeated the dog, but also ushered in the moment of duel with the painter...(translated from douban)
