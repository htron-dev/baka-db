    "sinopse": "Utahime Fight is a collection of three short stories, all of which are about magical, mysteriously attractive girls and they effect they have on the people around them.\n\nIn the first story, a girl and her two friends (one male, one female) are really magical fighters for something - probably love and justice.\n\nThe second story follows two girls who are magically drawn into the plot of a movie, in which a prince strives to save his mother and his land. After being threatened with their lives, they wake up in the library in school. They have a final scene in which they admit that they love each other and story ends.\n\nThe third story is about a magical creature that enchants a young man and brings love into his life.
