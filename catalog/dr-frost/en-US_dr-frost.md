## Sinopse

The consultation room of Yonggang University's psychology department is run by the genius Dr. Frost. Skilled at reading people, he is an easily recognizable figure with his shocking white hair and stoic face. But Dr. Frost has one fatal flaw—he lacks certain emotions, like love and empathy. Despite this, he solves every case that comes his way using his expansive textbook knowledge and sharp perception.

Aiding him in his work is his assistant Yoon Seong-Ah, a young psychology student at the university. As the two work together to uncover the emotions and motivations of others, Dr. Frost begins to discover a part of himself which he lost long ago.
