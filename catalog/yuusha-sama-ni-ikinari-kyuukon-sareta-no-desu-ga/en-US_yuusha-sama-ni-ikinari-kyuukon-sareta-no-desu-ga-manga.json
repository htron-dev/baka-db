    "sinopse": "Hero saves princess, hero marries princess, and they live happily ever after... right?\n\nIn record time, the hero Greed returns from effortlessly rescuing the princess, and he asks only for marriage as payment—except not to the princess but her maid, Aria Milford! However, while Greed's love for her lies prominently on display for all to see, Maid A, as she affectionately refers to herself, is certain that this development should never have even happened. Nevertheless, this situation suddenly boosts her from \"mob character\" to the main heroine herself! With her peaceful life in the background shattered, Aria must now deal with the attention of the entire kingdom, pressure to marry from the king himself, and the unsolicited love of a pushy hero.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
