## Sinopse

Wrapped in snow and ice, a country of severe winter. In the country that has lost its spring, the populace freeze, starve, and compete amongst themselves for rations to live another day. When a girl who hides in herself an earnest desire and an old knight that is wanted by the country meet in a hellish world, an adventure that will overturn the world begins. With the kingdom as their enemy, they will take back everything that was stolen.
