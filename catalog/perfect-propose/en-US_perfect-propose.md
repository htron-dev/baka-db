## Sinopse

Between his intense workload and asshole boss, salaryman Hirokuni is burnt out! He's on the edge of a nervous breakdown when Kai, a childhood friend he used to look after, comes to visit for the first time in 12 years. Kai has recently become homeless, so Hirokuni reluctantly lets him move in. Kai quickly confesses that he is gay, and Hirokuni worries that his chastity might be in danger! But then Kai gets to work, serving up delicious home-cooked food for breakfast, lunch and dinner... Isn't it kind of nice to be taken care of for once...? The domestic story of a handsome, cool guy with great housekeeping skills and a lonely, burned out salaryman!
