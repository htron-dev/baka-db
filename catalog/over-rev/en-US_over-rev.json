One day while out with her friends, she witnesses two cars racing and gets caught up in the excitement, especially after realizing the one driver is a young woman like herself! When a chance arrives for her to try drifting, she dives right in, even though she's never driven a car before. Suddenly, she has a new passion... and a lot to learn.",
