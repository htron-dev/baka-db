## Sinopse

Volume 1 of the Yuu Watase Masterpiece Collection

Story 1: Gomen Asobase! - Miyagawa Hao has just come to Tokyo from Osaka. To relieve her of a headache, a passing bishounen offers her a packet, which was suppose to have a pill inside. By mistake, the guy gives Miyagawa a very important button. Miyagawa finds out he goes to her same school, which divides the boys and girls with a very large wall.

Story 2 & 3: Pajama de Ojama and Pajama de Labyrinth - Legend has it that if you wear the same pajamas as the one you love, you will be transported to him for a short period of time. Misaki Aguri decides to try this out with the person she has a crush on, Isozaki. She never quite gets where she wants to be.

Story 4: Koori Musume wa Otoshigoro - Kahyouzan Koori runs into Kazama Shuuhen at the beach (quite literally) and falls in love with him. Her grandmother does not approve of this relationship, and makes a deal with the couple. If she can break a string tied around their fingers, Kazama must leave Kahyouzan. Unfortunately for Kazama, the Koori family has a special ability that he must defend himself against.
