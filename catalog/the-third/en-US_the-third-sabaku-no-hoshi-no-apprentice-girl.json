    "sinopse": "Many years after a devastating war killed 80% of the population, Earth is being watched by a group of beings known as The Third, named for the third red eye on their forehead that can access various computer systems. Navigating this barren, apocalyptic landscape is Honoka, a jill-of-all-trades that uses her powerful third blue eye to detect life forces in battle as she attempts to keep her friends from The Third's deadly grasp.",
