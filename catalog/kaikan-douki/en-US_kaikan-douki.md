## Sinopse

Niwa Tasuku working at Sanden Printing Company for 2 years now but still can't get along at all with with Yukino Tsumugi, a female colleague at the DTP temperament. Their colleagues try to 'break the ice' by inviting them out for drinks but later that night, they ended up in a love hotel. A strange "connection" is made between these two, one that would 'link' them during the most private thoughts and moments!
