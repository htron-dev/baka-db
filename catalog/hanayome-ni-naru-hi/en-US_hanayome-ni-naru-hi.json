    "sinopse": "\"I can't believe the man of my dreams is right in front of me!\" At a friend's wedding ceremony, Tess reunites with Cole, whom she secretly had feelings for in high school. To the plain and unremarkable Tess, he was as unreachable as the sun. \"He's grown more attractive, and it makes my heart beat fast, but I know that I'm not his type. I have to get rid of these one-sided emotions, fast.\" But unaware of her true feelings for him, Cole makes a cruel request of Tess. \"I'm searching for someone to marry. Can you introduce me to any women?\"\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
