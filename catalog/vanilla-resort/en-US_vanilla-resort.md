## Sinopse

Shy and socially awkward Mutsu is a successful adult mangaka but pretty hopeless at taking care of himself so when he runs into his old basketball team senpai while Akiharu was on a job search it all seems perfect. Lately Mutsu's been juggling so many projects that he can barely hold a spoon from all the drawing much less make time to sleep so when Akiharu helps him out of an awkward situation, it works just a little too well...
