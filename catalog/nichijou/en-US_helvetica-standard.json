    "sinopse": "The follow-up to the hit manga series Nichijou (and heavily referenced in the artwork of that series), Helvetica Standard is a full-color anthology of Keiichi Arawi's comic art and design work. Funny and heartwarming, this two-part series is a humorous look at modern day Japanese design in comic form and a deep-dive into the artistic and creative mind of Keiichi Arawi. Part comic, part diary, part art and design book, Helvetica Standard is a deconstruction of the world of Nichijou.\n\n(Source: Vertical Inc.)",
