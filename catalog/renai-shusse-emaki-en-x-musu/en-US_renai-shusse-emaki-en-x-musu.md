## Sinopse

Gisuke, the errand boy of his high school, is short, not too bright, and has bad luck. Then Sonya, a clumsy and chipper russian maid carrying a strange talisman enters his life. The talisman is part of a set of 15, and he who collects all 15 is sworn in as the successor of Dragoon, one of the worlds most powerful companies. Gisuke is then saught after by the carriers of the other 14 talismans, as his 'enmusu' or 'friendship' talisman is considered easy pickings. In short, Gisuke's hapless life has turned into a struggle for power.
