    "sinopse": "In Teirin High School, you are either part of a gang or an elite sports player. Sousuke Youki, called \"the predator,\" is an undefeated master at fighting. One morning, as he finishes up a fight, Kazumi, a prodigy amateur golf player, took a look at Sousuke, ignored him, and walked right by. Infuriated, Sousuke sets out to get revenge on Kazumi for dissing him but Sousuke's revenge takes a detour as he gets himself involved in playing golf by the thuggish golf coach. Will this delinquent break legends and become \"The King of Golf?\"\n\n(Source: MU)",
