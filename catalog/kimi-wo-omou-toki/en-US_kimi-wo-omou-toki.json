    "sinopse": "What does it mean to love? Most of the time, I don't know... Falling in love with someone always ends up with a farewell. Encounters in which you can meet a kind man are very rare. For someone to tell me \"Momo-chan, I love you very much~ ♪\" and to caress me with a smile... I don't understand the meaning of those things. Still, that kind of behavior makes my head spin and I feel warm.\n\nCollection of short stories:\n\n• Kimi wo Omou Toki\n\n• Ryakudatsu Egotist\n\n• Sokubaku Darling",
