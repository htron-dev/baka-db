## Sinopse

Yui has a deep love for her "older brother," and she is devastated when he gets married. While at the wedding, Yui meets a sobbing boy, Kaoru. It turns out that his cousin (that he was in love with) is the one Yui's brother is marrying. When Yui moves into a boys dorm so she can seek out new love, she finds that the head of the dorm is none other than Kaoru!
