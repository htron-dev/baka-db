    "sinopse": "Ever since Michi Nagihara was nearly kidnapped as a child, she has done her best to avoid standing out. Yet, on her way home one night, she catches the eye of a beautiful stranger who proclaims her to be his muse—and then asks her to undress!\n\nManaging to escape from the situation, Michi considers what happened to be a dream. But at school the next day, she runs into the same boy, Chihiro Ayano, and learns that he is an apprentice designer the same age as herself. Despite apologizing for his prior behavior, he flusters her again by confessing to have fallen in love with her at first sight and proposing that they work together.\n\nEmboldened by Michi's cooperation, Chihiro creates designs to emphasize her natural charm and grow her self-confidence. In return, she wants to bring out the best in his clothes and show them off to everyone. However, there is a side to Chihiro that only Michi gets to see, and unlike his clothes, she desires to keep his sweet words and gestures all to herself.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
