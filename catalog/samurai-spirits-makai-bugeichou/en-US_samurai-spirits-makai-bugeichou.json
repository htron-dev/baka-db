    "sinopse": "The year is 1787, the Tenmei Era, a time of plague and famine in Japan, when ordinary swordsmen only add to the piles of corpses in the streets. But Nakoruru, a nature-worshipping Ainu priestess; Haohmaru, a bold samurai with a death wish; and Hanzo, a ninja loyal to the Shogun, are samurai spirits with a common destiny!\n\nWith Nakoruru's guidance, the trio battle the supernatural forces of the Dark Kingdom, led by the half-human wizard Madou Shiranui. If Shiranui's troops succeed in fomenting a war between Japan's warlords, the resulting devastation will clear the way for the Dark Kingdom's invasion of Earth. Can three brave samurai stave off an all-out attack by an entire legion of demons?\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
