    "sinopse": "A Mameshiba collaboration with the Niigata prefecture. The prefecture produces the most edamame commercially in Japan as well as leading agriculture genetic research for new strains. It makes them the \"king of edamame\" and in this short King Edamame Shiba speaks about all the greatness of Niigata edamame. All three episodes use the same animation but they contain vastly different dialogue, as the Mameshiba franchise's main purpose is trivia.",
