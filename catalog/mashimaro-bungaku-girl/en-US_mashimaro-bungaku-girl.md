## Sinopse

In the late Meiji Period, as Japan undergoes the process of modernization, Mone Hoshino is a student at an all-girls private high school in Tokyo, where she lives with her male guardian. Although a young woman's duty is to be beautiful and modest so as to become a suitable bride, Mone has a stronger passion - literature! Writing is believed to corrupt women, so Mone cuts off her braids, dons schoolboy clothing, and joins an all-male literature club. Although she must face a bit of drama concerning her choices, the friends Mone makes help her hone her talents and give her inspiration as the take her on adventures around town.
