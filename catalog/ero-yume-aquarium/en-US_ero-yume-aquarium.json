    "sinopse": "I, Hiroto Yuri, have apparently become a pervert. Lately, I keep seeing erotic dreams where sea creatures are playing with me. And all while Ogasawara-kun, the marine biology nerd, watches me! I honestly didn't understand all of his geeky sea creature talk at first. But... I've always tried to act \"normal\" by hiding the fact that I'm gay, so I became attracted to how he's true to himself and doesn't care about what other people think. When I realized that I liked him, my dreams became even more obscene, and I even got aroused at the aquarium... What the hell is happening to me...?!\n\n(Source: East Press, translated)",
