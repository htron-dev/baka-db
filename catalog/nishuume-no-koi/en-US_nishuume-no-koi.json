But when Yamamoto wakes up, he finds himself in his old home, ten years in the past! While he needs to find a way to get back to the present, Yamamoto also wants to lay his regrets to rest. \"This time, I'll say what I couldn't say on the day of the school festival...\"\n\n(Source: East Press, translated)",
