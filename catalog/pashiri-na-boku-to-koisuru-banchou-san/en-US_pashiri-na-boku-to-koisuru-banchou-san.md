## Sinopse

One could describe Fuyuhiko Unoki as a weakling. From elementary to middle school, he was constantly bullied by his peers. He has now entered high school, and yet this has not changed. One day, the school's top delinquent, Kanade Toramaru, calls him out, and she immediately declares ownership over him.

His high school days will now be full of fear, as he spends them as Kanade's personal errand boy. However, one big misunderstanding between Fuyuhiko and Kanade remains: Kanade believes that the two of them are dating. Her confession of love is misinterpreted by him, leaving her blissfully unaware of Fuyuhiko's dread for her.

While this misunderstanding stays neglected, Fuyuhiko and Kanade become ever closer, slowly pushing this imaginary romance on the verge of turning into a real one.
