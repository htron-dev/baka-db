## Sinopse

When the clock struck twelve, instead of partying hard, wealthy playboy Michael Wentworth was making soft, gooey eyes at a beautiful stranger's newborn. Worse, everyone seemed to think he was the proud papa of Beth Masterson's bouncing baby boy. Heck, he'd only just met the woman when she'd come to his door with information on the missing Wentworth heir! Well... To gain his inheritance Michael did need a temporary wife, and the struggling, unwed mom sure could use a man to set up house with -- and maybe even a happily ever after. But was marriage-resistant Michael ready to be that man?
