    "sinopse": "Yukio \"Koyuki\" Tanaka wasted away his middle school days listening to Japanese pop music and apathetically trudging through lifeâ€”until a casual run-in with the enigmatic guitarist Ryuusuke \"Ray\" Minami. Through this encounter, Koyuki realizes what he has been missing all this time as Ray introduces him to western rock music and jumpstarts his desire to play guitar.\n\nAlthough various struggles plague his path to rock fame, Koyuki refuses to abandon the passion that gave his life purpose, balancing it together with school, work, and friends. Beck tells the story of the love and trial that accompanies pursuing a professional career in music as Koyuki and Ray work toward realizing the guitarist's dream of the ultimate band.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
