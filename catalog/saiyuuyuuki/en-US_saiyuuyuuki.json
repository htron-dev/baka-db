    "sinopse": "A 4-koma parody of the famous Chinese story Journey to the West.\n\nGojou is an earnest disciple of the laid-back Sanzou, who is a priest of a fictional religion. The other disciples, the apathetic and violent smoker Gokou and the otaku pig Hakkai do little to help keep their band organized. It seems Gojou is the only one who takes their work seriously, and he is the one who ends up dealing with all of their secular problems. The three of them travel with their priest, as he attempts to spread his religion and avoid being eaten by demons.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
