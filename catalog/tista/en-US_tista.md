## Sinopse

A serial killer is stalking the evildoers of New York City with a sniper rifle. The NYPD is baffled - all that is known is her code name - Sister Militia - and that she is an amazingly accurate from long distances, needing only only an instant's glimpse of her target to take her shot.

Her secret identity is Tista, a reclusive college student who was raised in a Catholic orphanage.
