## Sinopse

Tome dreams of becoming a famous fashion designer. She's on the right track, working for some big-shots, and then Tamara gets dumped on her. While Tamara may be a famous beauty on the run-way, in her normal, daily life, the supermodel is self-centered, obnoxious, bossy, and an utter leech. However, when the bearer of a "cursed" necklace dies at a fashion show, is Tamara the only help Tome will get to solve the mystery? (Source: Storm in Heaven)
