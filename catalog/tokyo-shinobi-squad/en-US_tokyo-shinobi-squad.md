## Sinopse

Tokyo, 2049... Thanks to the Galapagos Reform enacted by the government, Russia, China, America, and Japan are now connected by a Hyper Loop system. This globalization has turned Tokyo into the most crime-ridden city in the world. To fight the rising crime, those who have been working in the shadows since the Sengoku period are needed... They are... the Shinobi!
