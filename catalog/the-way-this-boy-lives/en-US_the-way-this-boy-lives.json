    "sinopse": "Dohun Yu has been living in England ever since his family collapsed. One day, Dohun comes to Korea almost forcefully without proper preparation. Don't ask me why, but I think it's his personality. (He does do things without planning anyway). Dohun loses his bag as he arrives in Seoul (the capital city of Korea) along with all his money. He comes completely money less within a day. A week later, he encounters an ad where it said \"Seeking a friend! Paying well...yada yada blah blah, girl only!\". Still having his suitcase which was confused with his sister's, he had girl's clothes. Having no other choice, he applies.",
