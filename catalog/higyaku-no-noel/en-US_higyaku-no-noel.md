## Sinopse

There is a girl who carries a lust for revenge in her eyes. Donned in a dark evening gown, with unnaturally pitch-black legs and lack of arms past her elbows, she makes a strange sight—even more so because a devil hides in her shadow. This girl is Noel Cerquetti; accompanied by the devil Caron, she once dreamed of becoming a renowned pianist. However, she was tricked into making a deal with a devil for someone else, ripping her wish—along with all four of her limbs—away.

Now, Noel yearns to get revenge against the man who used her for his benefit. Utilizing her illegal pact with Caron, she knows the only way to recover her limbs: she must make him lose everything, systematically ruining the corrupt empire he has built around himself.
