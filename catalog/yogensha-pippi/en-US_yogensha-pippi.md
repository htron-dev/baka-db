## Sinopse

PIPPI, a humanoid computer developed to predict earthquakes, estimates that a global-scale cataclysm will occur in eight years. Though the computer also announces that the accompanying danger of human extinction can be avoided by taking a series of specific steps, the process deviates so far from normality that people are thrown into a state of chaos and doubt.
