## Sinopse

Out of the blue, the new president, Taiga, suddenly ordered Kei Amami to become his secretary. Though confused, Kei reluctantly agrees, but upon meeting Taiga, Kei was shocked to see the person who was responsible for his trauma way back from high school! Kei immediately rejected Taiga's proposal, but Taiga couldn't take the rejection well. And so starts the relentless love pursuit!
