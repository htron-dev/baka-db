## Sinopse

Itou Keita is a boy with no remarkable talents beyond his better-than-average luck, until one day he receives an acceptance letter out of the blue inviting him to attend the prestigious all-boys academy, Bell Liberty School (BL School). Why has he been admitted to this amazing academy, and how can he possibly live up to the expectations of whoever let him in? As he settles in to his new life, Keita is sure to find companionship in his rather eclectic cast of schoolmates.
