    "sinopse": "When a \"god\" tells Tsukina that she is to be transported to another world to become its savior, Tsukina isn't interested. As a bookish thirty-something, she has zero desire to go on some big adventure...so when she arrives in the strange new land, she decides to use her magical powers to create a cozy little book cafe instead. But when a fellow \"savior\" starts causing trouble, Tsukina might just have to play the hero, after all!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
