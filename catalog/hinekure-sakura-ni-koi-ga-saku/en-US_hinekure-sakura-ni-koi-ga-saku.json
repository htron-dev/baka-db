    "sinopse": "Sakura Somei has been praised for being cute ever since he was little. In high school, he heard rumors about Tsukasa Yukihira, a guy even better looking than himself, and finds himself falling for him at first sight. Sakura is so sure Tsukasa will fall for his pretty-boy charms if he hangs around him long enough, he follows him to the point of acting like a stalker. Although he manages to get into the same college as Tsukasa, his stubborn personality doesn't allow him to come clean about how he feels. Sakura is eventually unable to keep his feelings at bay and ends up locking lips with Tsukasa! In the aftermath, he soon discovers what kind Prince Charming Tsukasa is really like...!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
