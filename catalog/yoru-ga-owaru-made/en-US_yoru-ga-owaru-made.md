## Sinopse

Public prosecutor Hiura's friend and colleague Kageyama has become the victim in one of his cases. It seems Kageyama was assaulted and dumped in a river, and the case is turning into a murder investigation. But if Kageyama is dead, where’s his body? Meanwhile Hiura is having strange and vivid dreams, and meets a man with an eerie resemblance to Kageyama.
