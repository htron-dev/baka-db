## Sinopse

Shima, who is an outcast at her school and unable to get along with her third stepfather, decides to move out to Sapporo and live with her biological father. There she meets Wao and Gen. Even though she knows she would be shunned by every girl in school for hanging out with them, there's nothing she can really do about it because she's fallen in love.
