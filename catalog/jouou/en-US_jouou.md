## Sinopse

Manager Nashizaki Tatsuya of the Pianissimo Club, wants to build the biggest hostess club in all of Japan; a club where men of all ages and nationalities would want to go. And, along with his big club, a huge event will take place, a contest for the number one hostess, with a prize of 100 million yen. Aya, a freshman, doesn't like the idea of being a hostess, but she has to become one, due to a big debt her parents owe. Encouraged by a friend, she reluctantly joins Pianissimo and, so, her life as a hostess begins. (Source: mangaupdates)
