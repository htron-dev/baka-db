## Sinopse

Tomoki Sakai is a member of the MDC. The "Mizuki Diving Club" is not doing very well. Their sponsors are getting ready to pull their support, but they do give the team a ray of hope. They tell them that if the new coach Kayoko Asaki can make one member enter the Olympics, that they will not pull their support. Can they accomplish this feat within a year? or just "drown in their own sorrows"?
