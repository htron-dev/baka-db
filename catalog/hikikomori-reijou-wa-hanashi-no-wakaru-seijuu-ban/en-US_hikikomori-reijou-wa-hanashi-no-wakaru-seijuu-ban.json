    "sinopse": "\"I have money for my fallen mother, so serve the royal palace!\"\n\nOne day, Muriel, the Countess, who was told by her father, refused. After all, she is a withdrawal who is not good at socializing and is reading only books. It's hard to work in the royal palace! I thought... but my dad suggested a librarian. Muriel immediately heads for an interview, thinking that he might be able to work there. Why is the sultry leader Cyrus the interviewer? And before you know it, was it adopted as the \"Holy Beast Ban\" that takes care of the holy beast?\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)",
