## Sinopse

This manga is about a couple of 17 year old guys and is settled in Tokyo’s Shibuya expensive neighborhood. They have been doing everything (including screwing their first women) together eversince middle school, where they became best friends. But Haruhiko cannot stand female company anymore and begins to insult them at the place they are used to going. No need to tell that they take it pretty badly and tend to get a tiny bit furious. Kenichi tries to calm things down though. The fact is that Haruhiko has something bothering himself and he cannot let Kenichi knowing about that… (Source: Daily Manga)
