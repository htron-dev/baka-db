    "sinopse": "The stepbrothers, Yamaguchi Masato, a salary man, and Akihiro, a model and an actor, are staying together because of some reasons. Masato always dreamt about Akihiro pampering him in bed. However, Akihiro was really holding him in bed when he woke up one morning and he couldn’t remember what happened the night before. Was it a dream or reality that really happened?\n\n(Source: Attractive Fascinante)",
