## Sinopse

Matsubayashi wants to be friends with his prim and proper classmate Miyazen, and unbeknownst to him, the feeling is mutual. However, being a brash-looking delinquent, he has a lot of trouble communicating with her despite her valiant (and embarrassing) attempts to use references to his favorite media.
