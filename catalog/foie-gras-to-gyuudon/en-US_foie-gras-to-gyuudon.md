## Sinopse

Bimi-san, the young lady of the Hokura Group, and Kousaku, a salaried worker of a small company, have a completely different sense of money, but they are loving couples without worrying about that. They are always happy to eat foie gras, beef bowls, high-quality yakiniku, izakaya yakitori, but as the relationship deepens, others begin to take notice?
