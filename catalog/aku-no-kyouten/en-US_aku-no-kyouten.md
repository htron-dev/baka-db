## Sinopse

In the hallowed halls of Shinkou Academy Machida High, no one is more capable and beloved than the charismatic and handsome teacher Seiji Hasumi, who is always willing to go the extra mile for his students. But beneath his charming facade lies a psychopath who manipulates people and events around him so that everything goes his way. From dealing with troublesome parents and bullies to unruly delinquents, no problem is too big for Hasumi, as he orchestrates events at the school and even murders people in order to build it into his own perfect kingdom.
