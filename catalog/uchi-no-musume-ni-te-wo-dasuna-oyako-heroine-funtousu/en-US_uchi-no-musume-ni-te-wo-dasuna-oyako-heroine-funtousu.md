## Sinopse

Meet “The Eighth Wonder”—a mother-daughter team of superheroes! Athena Haruka, the original Eighth Wonder, disappeared twenty years ago after a battle with the villainous organization, Blowjob. Now, Eighth Wonder has reappeared—but it's Athena's daughter, Clara, recruited to fill her mother's superhero shoes. When her daughter makes her debut as a superhero, Athena must leave the comforts of retirement, don her costume once again, and return to fighting crime so she can keep her daughter safe. But are the combined skills of these two super-powered women enough to combat what the world has in store for them?
