## Sinopse

Based on the Linux operating system variant Ubuntu, this "slapstick school comedy," three high school students—the fervent UNIX user and club president Akane Kisaragi, the hardcore gal-game otaku vice-president Masato Midou, and the doujinshi-drawing Mac fan Risa Shiina—are learning how to use Ubuntu in their systems adminstration club.
