## Sinopse

Shiro Manabe, who's busy working as the manager of a travel agency, relieves the stress from his daily life by working at a cross-dressing club for just three hours on Saturday nights as "Mashiro." One day, the high-spec, sarcastic subordinate who's always looking down on him, Kuro Nabatame, visits the store by chance...?! His stress-relieving hobby of crossdressing was discovered! What will he have to do in order to keep his secret?!
