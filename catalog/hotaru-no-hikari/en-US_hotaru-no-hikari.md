## Sinopse

27-year-old Hotaru would rather sleep at home than seek romance, but due to unforeseen circumstances, suddenly she's living with her boss, Takano. What's more is that she now has a budding relationship with Makoto, who's younger than she is. Like a dried fish thrown back into the ocean, can she learn to swim again and rediscover the ways of romance?
