    "sinopse": "An American ambassador and his family move into an old castle. They learn from the help that Simon, a man suffering for 300 years due to a heavy sin he committed, resides in the castle. The Americans are quite lighthearted and unfazed by the situation. The father gives the ghost a gift, the boys pillow fight and play tricks on him, and the daughter Virginia is kind and forgiving with him. The ghost is quite surprised because he's used to haunting and people hating him.",
