    "sinopse": "Ever since he was a child, Tatsuro had been fascinated by his grandfather's tales of dragons which sustained even when he reached adulthood. Requested one day to hunt a wild beast roaming the mountains, instead of the beast, he finds a person named Talim, who turned out to be a dragon. Apparently, Talim has great curiosity about humans but his difficulty with maintaining his human form prevents him from interacting with them. Thus begins a friendship between human and dragon which may lead to something more.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)\n\nIncluded one-shots: Hanarete Kudasai, Hina-senpai, Ore no Joushi wa Dame Kawaii",
