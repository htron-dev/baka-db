## Sinopse

A projection with six projectors, Human Events is a film made for a dance performance by Tsujimura Kazuko at Kinokuniya Hall, Shinjuku, Tokyo. The images comprise of extreme close-ups of the dancer’s body that is massaged by a finger as the color of the image changes. Arranged in a two (side)-by-three (down) composition, different parts of the body gets scattered in ways that defy the familiar order of the anatomy.
