## Sinopse

Earl Craven’s territory is laden with rules to abide – when the earl himself walks in the hallway, all servants present should turn their back on him, avoiding his gaze, which is why even his servants call him “the devil”… except for one. Priscilla is a maid in Earl Robert Craven’s abode and is the only one who captured the young earl’s tender heart. But what happens when a rich woman comes and calls the earl her future husband for the sake of business? Will their love prevail, or will their social status hinder them? This is a story about the struggles and trials of the star-crossed lovers.
