At the renowned Hanzo Academy, a select group of students trains in secret to become ninjas of an elite clan known as the Shinobi Masters. Following her grandfather's footsteps, the hopeful Asuka undergoes this intensive training alongside her distinctive group of friends: Ikaruga, Katsuragi, Yagyuu, and Hibari.
