    "sinopse": "Akane is a second-year student, who enjoys his student life. Toujou, one of Akane's classmates, is Akane's new roommate. Until last year, Toujou was an ordinary, serious, and excellent student, but one day, he suddenly dyed his hair red, got a piercing, and started wearing fashionable clothes? Thus, Akane is thrown into this new living arrangement. One day, Akane sees Toujou sneaking out of the dormitory in the middle of the night! Ignoring the dormitory rules, Toujou goes out to work at night. It seems like Toujou has something he wants to keep secret. Akane worries that something might happen to him and is unable to remain indifferent?!\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)",
