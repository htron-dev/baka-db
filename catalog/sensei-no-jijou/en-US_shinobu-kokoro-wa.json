With his fiery combination of sheer force, considerable guile and devastating proficiency, no man can resist his skill! Follow the sizzling sessions with a young, innocent ninja-in-training as his master teaches him the secret methods of the clan...with a little hands-on instruction! Meanwhile, two experienced shinobi take their relationship to new heights when a tragic separation leaves one of them caught between a rock and hard place. Filled with over-the-top \"action,\" boys in tight uniforms, and one very lascivious snow spirit, this romantic fantasy collection is one part passion, one part affection, and all heart.
