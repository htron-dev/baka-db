    "sinopse": "\"Hmm... I have no talent.\"... is what Yuan grew up in the mountains thinking. He's a normal kind-hearted boy, but the unusual thing about him is that his parents are a sage and a master martial artist; in other words, the world's strongest. Since Yuan was told he was the weakest, he leaves home to make his dreams come true.\n\n(Source: SB Creative, translated)",
