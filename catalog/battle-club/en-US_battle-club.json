    "sinopse": "When freshman transfer Mokichi arrives at Swan Academy High, he's got a chance to start over with a clean slate. He's got a plan, too. Kick the butts of the toughest guys in school, prove himself to be the baddest dude around, and run the whole shebang. Problem is, it's his butt that gets kicked that first day. Completely humiliated, Mokichi joins the Wrestling Club in hopes of learning to fight. There he meets unlikely allies, Tamako and Higuchi, two of the hottest battle babes to ever roll their sweaty bods over Swan Academy's gym mats. And Mokichi's gonna need all the friends he can get, what with the likes of the Karate Club looking to \"break in\" the new kid in the worst way possible. (Source: Tokyopop)",
