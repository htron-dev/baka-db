## Sinopse

Himeno has transferred to a former boys' school, called Hallelujah, which has only recently become co-ed. This, however, means that very few females knew that they could enter the school, and Himeno, aided by a scholarship, is the only female student. The president of the students association, Gaou, is an extreme misogynist, and the relationship between the two becomes intense. Himeno needs helpâ€”but where to find it in a school full of rowdy, rude men?
