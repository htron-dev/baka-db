## Sinopse

The Tachibana family and Akiyoshi family have always been on close ties as the fathers are good friends. Ever since Akiyoshi Hiromu's father passed away, the Tachibana family had always taken care of him and his younger brother.

After graduating from university, upon invitation, Hiromu goes to work at the Tachibana's frozen food company. Eventually, he settles into the role of secretary to Tachibana Yuusuke, a womanizer who is also irresponsible at work.

Yuusuke's father leaves the company into his hands when he is stricken with cancer. Unexpectedly, in exchange for good behaviour at work, the young boss makes a proposition to Hirumu: Stay at my place and sleep with me.
