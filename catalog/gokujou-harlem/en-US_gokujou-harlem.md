## Sinopse

"Who are these two good-looking guys on my sofa?" Rei finds herself confronted with this mystery after returning home from another long day at a law office. Entrusted in her care by her mother in the fashion biz, these two model proteges become Rei's new "pets" - at least, that what she tells herself. Still, how many pets out there cook dinner and do the laundry in addition to providing some much-needed TLC? Confronted with this unusual - and enviable - situation, Rei senses her life beginning to change...
