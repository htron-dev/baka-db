    "sinopse": "The time is the not-so-distant future and the planet Earth is under attack by an army of merciless aliens. Its only hope is the Starlight—a craft originally designed to realize man’s dream of traveling between the stars—and it’s genetically altered human pilot Mitsuha (codename: Silbuster). Inside of her and her four siblings lay the secret to completing the ship’s light wave engine. Only then can the alien threat be destroyed once and for all. Unfortunately, the creatures are well aware of this fact and will stop at nothing to destroy the adventurous family. Silbuster and crew must use their awesome powers and abilities to fend off the aliens until the key to humanity’s salvation can be uncovered. (from Atomic Avenue.com).\n\nPublication information can be found under 'More Info'",
