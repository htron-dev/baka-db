    "sinopse": "Amagai Gakuen, a prestigious school for boys, was hit by an unusual spring storm during the entrance ceremony. Five boys—Hazuki, Touma, Yuusuke, Junta and Madoka—were all caught in the storm's violence and were affected by a strange phenomenon. All of them were transformed into girls!!\n\nInevitably they will meet someone and fall in love. Bikke wholeheartedly introduces this new, beautifully drawn series about boys and girls coming of age.\n\n(Source: MU)",
