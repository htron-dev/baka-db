    "sinopse": "Working in a general store, Asami doesn't have any luck with men. Disadvantaged by his nature of taking care of people and responding to people telling him \"I like you,\" lunatics, sugar babies, and abusive men lined up for him, one after the other.\n\nThe next one will be a normal partner... As Asami thought this, a beautician named Shitara appeared before him.\n\nHe is dumbfounded when Shitara approaches him with a flirtatious \"Do you like me?\" He firmly rejects him, but Shitara isn't discouraged in the slightest. Despite Asami thinking that he can't have a straight man as a partner, one day, he learns of Shitara's lonely past...?\n\n(Source: Kaiousha, translated)",
