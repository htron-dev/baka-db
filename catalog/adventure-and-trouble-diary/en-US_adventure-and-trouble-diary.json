    "sinopse": "\"If you become my wife, I'll grant any wish...\" Maybe it wouldn't sound half as crazy if Saeju wasn't told this by a cat (who may or may not be some kind of prince). But she's desperate for some payback, particularly when her longtime crush blows her off, ice-cold style. But what happens when you invite someone downright... unearthly... into your life? Saeju's about to find out—particularly when one strange cat becomes one strange \"brother\" she didn't ask for!\n\n(Source: Lovers Dream)",
