## Sinopse

Sakamoto Masami is in his first year of high school and the ace of the basketball club. Because of his asocial behavior, his coach tells him to temporarily join the school's cheer leading club to increase his team spirit. Soon he finds out this isn't your average cheer leading club. All of sudden Masami is facing the choice to either put his male pride aside and dress up as a girl, or to never return to the basketbal club.
