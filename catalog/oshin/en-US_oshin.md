## Sinopse

A manga version of Oshin, a Japanese serialized morning television drama, airing on broadcaster NHK from April 4, 1983 to March 31, 1984. The series follows the life of Tanokura Shin during the Meiji period up to the early 1980s. Shin was called "Oshin", which is Japanese archaic cognomen.

The different between this manga and the TV series is that it is shorter and the manga ended before Oshin is forced to work as a bar maid by her father.
