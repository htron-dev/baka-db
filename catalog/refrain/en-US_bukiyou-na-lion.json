    "sinopse": "For the popular actor Hajime Mishima, there is Aihara, an actor that is his complete opposite, but someone he gets along with as well. One day, Mishima consulted Aihara regarding a kissing scene with a guy in a drama he would work on, and to his surprise, Aihara carelessly replied, \"Do you want to try it with me?\" Though confused, Mishima kissed Aihara. For some reason, Mishima was really shaken by the kiss, in contrast with Aihara, who's not even bothered by it at all.\n\n(Source: Gentosha Comics, translated)",
