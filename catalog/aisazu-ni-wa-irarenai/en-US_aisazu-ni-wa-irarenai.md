## Sinopse

Ayumi Fujita begins the first year at the University of Shunzan in Yokohama. She moved for the first time in a pension after leaving the family home at Toyama. The owners of the residence where she stays care for her as if she was their son who disappeared, and she quickly befriends her roommates Ikuko and Asami.

She meets Kazuyuki Narushima, a sophomore, who saves her as she drowns in a fountain and she falls in love with him.
