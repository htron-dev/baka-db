    "sinopse": "Many people in this world were born with commonplace magical abilities. These are usually things that make their lives a bit more convenient, such as the ability to make a small flame, or to heal slightly more quickly than usual. But the young, brilliant lord of Seeker Castle has a little sister with incredible destructive magic powers, which he uses to kill anyone who threatens his territory. Also living with the lord and his sister is a boy whose magical powers are still a mystery. The story of their entwined destiny begins now!\n\n(Source: MU)",
