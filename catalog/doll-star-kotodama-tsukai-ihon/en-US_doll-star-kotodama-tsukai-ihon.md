## Sinopse

Everyone knows that Yugi Nonoka is crazy. Her classmates have ostracized her and her teachers have given up on her. Yet, while Yugi may seem messed to the world, she has a disturbing knack for knowing the messed up crap that other people are hiding. And she has the power to do something about it...
