## Sinopse

For Anri, age 17, there can be only one--the popular singer SHIN. She'd risk her life to be transformed into a woman by him, and she'd sooner die than knowingly give her virginity to anyone else. After executing a few bold, attention-getting maneuvers, Anri gets what she wants, and then runs off before the man wakes up again. ...BUT was the man really SHIN? Anri discovers that there are fake SHINs who try to get women like that, and one incriminating piece of evidence suggests that the man Anri gave her virginity to was not SHIN. Revenge is now a matter of pride, and she's going to make this man pay! But does Anri really have any idea who she's waging war against?
