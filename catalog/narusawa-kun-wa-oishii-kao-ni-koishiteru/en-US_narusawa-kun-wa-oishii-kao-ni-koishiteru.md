## Sinopse

Narusawa-kun, a loner with an ugly scar on his forehead, and a perpetual scowl on his face. Despite his scary looks, he has a soft spot for girls who enjoy their food. Watching a cute girl eating happily is his passion in life. One day, a mysterious Italian girl appears before Narusawa... and she just happens to have his "preferred way of eating"!?

A sensational romantic comedy about a lonely guy and a cheerful girl!
