## Sinopse

Suzunoki Hatsune works as an Onmyouji for an occult consulting company. They track down mystical problems, and help the people that find themselves caught up in them. Hatsune isn't doing spirit work because she wants to, though. Her father was a great Onmyouji, but he left her his debts to pay. She's just doing this because its the best way to get them paid off. She and her colleagues encounter lots of different situations that involve difficulties with things like ghosts or spirits.
