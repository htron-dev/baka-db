## Sinopse

The story revolves around Suzunoki Hatsune, a normal high school girl... or so she strongly wishes, because she has no desire to succeed her stepfather as the strongest onmyouji in modern Japan. Still, she has the ability to see spirits, and as luck would have it, her emerging abilities are pointing her to a terrifying truth behind the deaths of her parents... and her stepfather may be involved!?
