In compliance with his father’s wish, he attends Saint Andromeda Academy, a school for Korea’s richest 1%. One day, a granddaughter of Man-deuk Wang, the owner of Korea’s largest company MD, acquires a large portion of MD shares, making everyone wonder who this mysterious girl is. Everything is a mystery except her name: Paris. Dong-su thinks nothing of it until his father orders him to transfer to Sunshine High School to seduce her. On his first day, he runs into a strange girl in lounge pants who speaks with a provincial accent. It shocks him when he finds out that she is the famous heiress Paris. They started off on the wrong foot, but will Dong-su still try to seduce Paris to restore his family’s fortunes?\n\n(Source: Manhwa Creator Bank)",
