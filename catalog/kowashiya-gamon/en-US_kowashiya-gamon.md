## Sinopse

What will happen if a clumsy high school boy suddenly becomes the head of a company whose job is to demolish anything, but with the use of "martial arts"?

Having no choice but to take over his father's company since he went missing, Gamon needs to keep the family business running no matter what, since he now has to support his three younger sisters. What will the future hold for Gamon the Demolition Man?
