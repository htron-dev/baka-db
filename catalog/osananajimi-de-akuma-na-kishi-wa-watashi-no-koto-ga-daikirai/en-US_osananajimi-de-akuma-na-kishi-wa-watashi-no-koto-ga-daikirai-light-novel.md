## Sinopse

"I don't like that kind of woman. Rather I dislike her. I hate her."

Overhearing her beloved childhood friend Reiss make that sort of declaration, Suria's first love was smashed into smithereens. While crying, she punched Reiss in the stomach with all her might and in that moment, she blurted out, "I hate you too!" and ran away. Several years have passed since the bitter memory. She has grown into adulthood as a precious existence, a "Spirit User." The one who appears in front of Suria, entrusted with an important task from the country to serve as her escort and possessing the nickname of the ruthlessly heartless "Demon Knight," it was Reiss.

Now traveling together, Suria's old wounds begin to resurface. But it seems like Reiss has some sort of secret... Until the two can be recompensed.
