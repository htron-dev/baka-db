## Sinopse

Kouya Marino hasn't set foot in the Tobita Club for a long time - not since when his older brother, champion Crush Gear Fighter Yuya Marino passed away four years ago. But when the C.G. club his brother was once part of is threatened with extinction from a rival team set up by the Mangajin Corporation, it is up to Kouya to restore the Tobita club to its former glory, using no less than Yuya's prized Crush Gear - the Garuda Eagle!! The spirited Crush Gear fight is about to begin!
