## Sinopse

My normal everyday life used to consist of my job, that didn't depend on me and my hobby, gardening. It's a modest lifestyle of living alone. Then one day, I open a door to another world...

I suddenly realized that there was an open air bath! After I broke off from some naked man and gathered my surroundings, I found out that I am Rosalind, the daughter of a ruined noble. I have absolutely no money, but if I can raise my favorite plants and make some money, I will persist and keep on living in this world.

I come from a low social standing so there is the chance I'll be harassed, but this mysterious man named Alexander, whose origins are unknown, has been taking care of me. Who exactly is he?
