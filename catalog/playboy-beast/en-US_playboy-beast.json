    "sinopse": "In a world where demi-beasts and humans co-exist, Riku Kurobuchi, a panther demi-beast, finds himself facing a dilemma. He is sociable, good looking, talented at sports, and popular with girls, but for some reason he still hasn't experienced his \"heat\" like everyone else. After an unexpected transfer, he begins sharing his dorm room with the mature and handsome albino lion demi-beast, Touma Shishigaya. Riku wants to keep his secret hidden from the confrontational Touma, but it's Touma's pheromones that bring about Riku's first heat!! This is a story of desire between a beautiful albino and an inexperienced demi-beast.\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
