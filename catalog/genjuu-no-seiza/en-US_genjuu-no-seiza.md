## Sinopse

Kamishina Fuuto would like to think he's a normal boy, but he is the reincarnation of the High Priest of Darashaal, a tiny Asian country that has just celebrated the inauguration of...its new high priest. Clearly, only one of them is the true priest, and unfortunately for Fuuto, it is he. As the celestial guardians come to dispose of him they discover that he is not, as their leader Naga says, a fake. Fuuto just wants to be normal and live a normal life, but he is constantly drawn into trouble as he has an extremely keen spiritual sense and the ability to soothe ghosts.
