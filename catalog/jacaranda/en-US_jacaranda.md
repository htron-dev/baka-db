## Sinopse

The shoot of an exotic tree appears in a Tokyo street. The popular affection turns into astonishment, then horror as the Jacaranda grows to colossal proportions, burning the capital to ashes in the course of a dantean night. Though, as sun rises survivors discover that it hasn't been a night of annihilation, but of rebirth.
