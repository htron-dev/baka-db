## Sinopse

Tonari no 801-chan is narrated by Tibet, a twenty-eight-year-old company employee and boyfriend to Yaoi, who also works in a company. Yaoi is a twenty-two-year-old fujoshi, a female otaku who is a fan of anime and manga series featuring yaoi, or romantic relationships between men. Tibet, who is an otaku himself, initially met Yaoi over the Internet. When she obsesses over yaoi, a small green furry monster comes out of a zipper from her back as the manifestation of her obsession.
