    "sinopse": "\"Pregnancy\" and \"Childbirth.\" Do you see these as things that have nothing to do with you? It's been 10 years since men are able to become pregnant and give birth. Kentarou Hiyama is an elite salaryman whose pregnancy caused him to experience firsthand the prejudice society holds towards \"male pregnancy and childbirth.\" He initially only decided to continue with his pregnancy as a mean to create a place where he can belong. But as he continues in his actions, little by little, not only do the people around him but he himself begins to change.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
