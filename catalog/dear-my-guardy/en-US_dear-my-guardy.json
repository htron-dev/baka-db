    "sinopse": "I think that having someone to be with is more enjoyable than being alone. A boy named Shirou came to live with Itsuki as her bodyguard while her parents are not at home. Actually, Shirou has the best grade in class and is very popular. The fact that Shirou is living with Itsuki is a secret at school. However, it seems that Shirou longs for a \"family.\" This is a heart warming story that makes your heart squirm at moments.\n\n(Source: Summer Rain)",
