## Sinopse

Sayama Takahiro, a carefree high school student, was transported to a fantasy world identical to the one of a certain VR game. His go-with-the-flow attitude eventually overpowered his desire to return home, and now he runs "Free Life," a small business dedicated to fulfilling the requests of its customers. Assisted by the hard-working Yumiel, what kinds of jobs will Sayama end up doing? If only someone would hire him to sleep till noon.
