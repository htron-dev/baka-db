Is there salvation for these men who live on the underside of society?\n\nIn the final part of the tattoo series, \"Everyone's Song,\" forty-two pages drawn specifically for the occasion, all the stories come to a conclusion.\n\nTwo extra stories are included in this collection. In ‘Spring Love’, the object of a man's one-sided love turns into a vengeful spirit every night and visits him. \"Dream's Guidance\" has also been added to this special collection.\n\n(from Nakama)",
