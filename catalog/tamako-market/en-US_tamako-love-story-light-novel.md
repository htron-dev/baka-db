## Sinopse

The novel will tell two original stories focusing on the feelings of Tamako and Midori, as well as Choi's heart that is in love as she searches for a bride for the prince on the southern island. Certain elements written in the novel will not be animated in the film.

Tamako and Midori's story takes place in the girls' third year of high school. Although everyone is thinking about their careers, Tamako's head is filled with thoughts of mochi. On the other hand, Mochizou has decided to go to a college in Tokyo. Midori watches the two, but has worries of her own.

In Choi's story, she continues to urgently search for a bride for the prince. She works together with Dera, who has fattened up like a ball, to use fortune-telling to find the prince's future bride, but with no luck. However, one day, the two find a certain document when they go to the country's library to look for hints on fortune-telling.
