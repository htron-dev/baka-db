Certain elements written in the novel will not be animated in the film.\n\nTamako and Midori's story takes place in the girls' third year of high school. Although everyone is thinking about their careers, Tamako's head is filled with thoughts of mochi. On the other hand, Mochizou has decided to go to a college in Tokyo. Midori watches the two, but has worries of her own.\n\nIn Choi's story, she continues to urgently search for a bride for the prince.
