## Sinopse

During a tournament in middle school, Rui fell in love at first sight with Youhei from the basketball club. I loved, loved, loved him, chasing after Youhei until we finally became lovers. Although we became separated in high school, I would die if it were for Youhei. I was happy as long as they were together.... Or so I thought. I had to study properly and think seriously about my career, but my greedy feelings overflowed and ahhh, the brakes won't work anymore!!
