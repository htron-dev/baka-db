## Sinopse

Having cooked too much rice one day, 28-year-old widow Shuuko Yakumo decides to share the surplus with her new neighbor, Shouhei Yamato. As an active member of his high school's baseball club, Yamato works up an enormous appetite, and his penchant for eating a lot reminds Yakumo of her late husband. These fond memories reignite her passion for cooking.

Ever since their first meal together, Yakumo has been inviting Yamato over to her home to eat every day, slowly building their friendship through love of food and baseball.
