    "sinopse": "Shunta Shii and Tamaki Yuminaga have been close since their childhood. As they grew up, they each changed in various ways, but the one constant that remains is the year separating them both in age and school grade level.\n\nAt some point, Shunta develops feelings for Tamaki, but he does not know how or if he should make this known to his best friend. He sees an opportunity when Tamaki confides in him about a recent breakup, ending with a remark that it seems he does not like girls. Unfortunately, Tamaki does not think that the other sex is a feasible alternative. Can Shunta change Tamaki's mind about the limitless possibilities of love?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
