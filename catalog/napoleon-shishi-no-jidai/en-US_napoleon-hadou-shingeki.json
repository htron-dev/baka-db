    "sinopse": "This manga picks up the story of Napoleon's life from \"Napoleon: Lion's Era.\" The story begins in 1800, shortly after Napoleon has consolidated his power as the First Consul. It starts with a bang, with the tragic assassination attempt known as the plot of Rue Saint-Nicaise, and the subsequent attempt to find those responsible. As Napoleon gains ever more power, the era of the Napoleonic Empire is almost ready to begin!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
