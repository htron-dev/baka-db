    "sinopse": "This is a story of the life of Napoleon. The tale begins just before the Battle of Austerlitz. Then, it jumps back to 1769 to tell the story of Napoleon's life from the very beginning, including the circumstances of his birth, his childhood on Corsica, and his difficulties as a Corsican boy in a French school. All of these experiences eventually culminate in his becoming the famous Emperor of the French.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
