## Sinopse

SAOTOME Nanno is a first-year high school girl living an ordinary life with her close friends Maki and Yuusuke. Although she dreams of having a boyfriend, she doesn't have a one, because she is wary of boys after one broke her heart in 6th grade.

One day at school, she encounters a very handsome boy who makes her heart beat fast. He is surprised to see Nanno and soon starts teasing her. He even asks her if she is already in love with him. The way he is talking is familiar to her. He uses the same lines as those in a 70's style-manga that Nanno's friend, Maki, reads. But that's not the only reason....this boy is none other than the one who broke her heart years before, Tsusuki-kun!

Nanno is angry and humiliated when she finds out his real identity while he made fun of her as he knew from who she was from the start. He already has a jealous girlfriend.

Nanno will never like him again even if he still makes her heart pound...but what if someone confesses to Nanno!? A new love comedy begins.
