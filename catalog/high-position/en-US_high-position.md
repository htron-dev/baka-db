## Sinopse

Mitsuhiko Amano is a middle-aged salaryman who has lost his job and is on the verge of separating from his wife, Sachiko, who will be leaving with their daughter Miyu. Filled with regret and wondering where it all went wrong, Mitsuhiko ends up dying in an accident and reawakens as a teenager. Now a high schooler reliving his past, Mitsuhiko believes this is a second chance to reshape his future and avert his impending misfortune—which means pursuing his high school crush instead of getting together with Sachiko.
