## Sinopse

With grim determination, Bryn steps into the gallery Archangel. After graduating from an arts university, Bryn has barely managed to make a living because her paintings keep getting turned down one after another by the galleries she's approached. Even though this exhibition may be her last chance, she's tried to stay away from this particular gallery because it is the one where Bryn's father committed fraud five years ago. She had been in love with Gabriel, one of the gallery owners, yet he was the one who put her father in prison. Now she has changed her name, and she's sure no one will recognize her... How can her plan go wrong?
