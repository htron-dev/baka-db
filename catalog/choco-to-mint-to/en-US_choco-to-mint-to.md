## Sinopse

Keiko is a junior 2nd year student, but has no experience in love. One day, while going to school, she helped an unconscious 'cute boy' who fainted from anemia. Being 2-faced, he doesn't thank Keiko but instead called her an old lady. Surprising as it is, that boy goes to her school and is a first year.
