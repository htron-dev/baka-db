    "sinopse": "Keiko is a junior 2nd year student, but has no experience in love. One day, while going to school, she helped an unconscious 'cute boy' who fainted from anemia. Being 2-faced, he doesn't thank Keiko but instead called her an old lady. Surprising as it is, that boy goes to her school and is a first year.\n\n(Source: Sugar888)\n\nIncluded one-shots: Sono Te wo Hanasanai (Never Let Go of This Hand), Sweet na Kankei (Sweet Relationship)",
