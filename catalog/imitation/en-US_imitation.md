## Sinopse

Behind all the glitz and glamour, the world of showbiz is an unforgiving place. Idols must maintain their image at all costs: a single slip-up could bring their career to a crashing halt. Despite this pressure, the promise of fame and adoration is more than worth the risk for many.

Lee Maha is a member of the newly formed group Tea Party, and has attracted the attention of many by imitating popular idols. But this has also caught the disdainful eye of Kwon Ryoc—one of the most famous stars in the industry. Though he initially looks down on her, Ryoc gradually realizes his feelings for Maha may be something more. However, scandals can ruin any idol's career, and if the pair decide to entertain their budding relationship, they may just threaten the fame they have worked so hard for.
