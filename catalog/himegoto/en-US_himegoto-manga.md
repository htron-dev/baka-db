## Sinopse

High school student Hime Arikawa may look indistinguishable from a girl, but he is actually a boy. Unable to pay off his family's debt, yakuza debt collectors force Hime to crossdress as a girl. However, the school student council sees this as an opportunity: in exchange for paying his debt, Hime must cater to their every whim while continuing to crossdress! And thus, Hime's comedic day-to-day school life with the student council begins.
