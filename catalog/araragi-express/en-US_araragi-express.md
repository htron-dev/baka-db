## Sinopse

Araragi Riuichi is a law student. But unlike others, he is very aware of human lives and how people can toy with them. So when he sees that a man is trying to kill a kid, he decides to come in action. But although he believes it`s the right thing to do, the police doesn`t share his idea, and so Araragi goes off on his own to fulfill his dreams and make a better world. But then in his way... The Araragi Way.
