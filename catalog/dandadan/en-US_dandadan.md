## Sinopse

After being aggressively rejected, Momo Ayase finds herself sulking when she stumbles across a boy being bullied. Saved by her rash kindness, the occult-obsessed boy attempts to speak to her about supernatural interests he believes they share. Rejecting his claims, Ayase proclaimed that she is instead a believer in ghosts, starting an argument between the two over which is real.

In a bet to determine who's correct, the two decide to separately visit locations associated with both the occult and the supernatural—Ayase visiting the former and the boy visiting the latter. When the two reach their respective places, it turns out that neither of them was wrong and that both the occult and ghosts do exist.

This marks the beginning of Ayase and the boy's adventure, who shares a name with Ayase's favorite idol—Ken Takakura, as they attempt to fix the surreal supernatural and sci-fi elements around them to return to a normal life.
