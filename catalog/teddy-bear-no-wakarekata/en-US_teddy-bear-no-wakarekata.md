## Sinopse

Due to renovations being done at his apartment, Saimiya Yuu asks his older brother’s best friend, Tasuku, if he can live with him until they are done. Tasuku has known Yuu for over six years and things between them are more complicated than anyone else realizes. How long will Yuu stay will Tasuku? And will anything come from this unusual situation?
