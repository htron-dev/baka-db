    "sinopse": "\"Come with me,\" her husband demands. Stacia hasn't seen Rico in over a year but he hasn't changed at all. His arrogant attitude, his alluring eyes... The free-spirited art lover Stasia and the workaholic billionaire Rico fell passionately in love, but Rico's sister's cruel lie ruined everything. But when his sister is involved in a serious accident she calls for Stacia. Perhaps she is trying to make up for what she did? Stasia makes her way to Sicily, where memories of love await her.\n\n(Source: MU)",
