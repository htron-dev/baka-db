## Sinopse

A guy who appears to be very laid-back, but is actually an unmoral, idiotic, and pervert!

The president and vice-president who are teamed together to unmask the secret of the biggest event in a student's life!

All sorts of embarrassing things can happen during the preparations for the Culture Festival!
