## Sinopse

In 1943, Hitler looked back to the glorious history of the Prussian grenadiers, and created the armoured infantry troops known as "Panzergrenadier". This manga tells the story of the early Panzergrenadier, through the eyes of a newly commissioned Panzergrenadier officer, deeply in love with the girl he left behind him and yet to experience the apocalypse of war.
