## Sinopse

In a world where humans are either Doms who live to be followed or Subs who live to serve, young Sub Akito is kept under careful lock and key by his master and uncle Naohito. Bound with the promise that he could be unchained and see the outside world when he comes of age, Akito thinks that he's perfectly fine with the status quo...until one night, a man breaks into their house and Akito's life.
