## Sinopse

Lost in the mountains on a trip to summer camp, eight-year-old Si-Joon fears he'll never make it out alive. When a strange girl in a pig mask appears before him, he follows her to a house deep in the woods, where he is told that he must marry the pig-faced girl to atone for the sins of their ancestors. Si-Joon's not too keen on getting married, but that wedding feast looks so delicious! It's only afterward that he realizes what he's done and...wakes up. Now in high school, Si-Joon Lee has been dreaming about the pig bride for as long as he can remember. But it's all just a dream, right?
