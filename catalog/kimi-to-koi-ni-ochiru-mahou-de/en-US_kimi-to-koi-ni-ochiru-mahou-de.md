## Sinopse

Ousawa Miko is a 16-year-old girl who loves bread. Especially when it's shaped cutely! One day she decides to apply for a job at St. Molly's bread store, but when she gets there, the person who hires her on is a cute boy her age! Although he makes fun of Miko's clumsiness, he seems to be genuinely kind. But when they find out they're neighbors, they grow even closer.
