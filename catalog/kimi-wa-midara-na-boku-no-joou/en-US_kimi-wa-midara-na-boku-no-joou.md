## Sinopse

Subaru Kawana has it all—she is smart, beautiful, and wealthy. This is in stark contrast to her childhood friend Akira Saitou, a boy who is the perfect example of mediocrity.

However, after years of separation and an uneventful high school reunion, Subaru has grown cold, and her relationship with Akira has turned bitter. Fortunately, Akira finds unlikely help from the mysterious Observe God, a powerful entity that magically connects his and Subaru's rooms into one, giving him the opportunity to reconcile with her. But the Observe God does not work for free: for his payment, he takes one hour of Subaru's self-control per day, and Akira soon discovers that his uptight friend has a more lewd, dirty side to her...
