## Sinopse

Ruki is a first-year university student and not particularly happy with her current life. Most of her friends have boyfriends and to her annoyance, they write and call them during every free minute. She has never been in love and also doesn't see herself in a relationship in the near future. But even though she claims to not be interested in anyone, she still can't hide the fact that she wants to fall in love too.
