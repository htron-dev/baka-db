    "sinopse": "Kurosawa Mahane is a 17 year old girl that gets kidnapped a lot. 78 times so far! Although Mahane managed to elude the previous 77 captors by herself, her newest one is different—he’s a strange, rather violent young man from a different world. He snaps a collar and chain on Mahane's neck and declares that she's an animal that lives only for his convenience. What kind of power does he have over Mahane and how will she escape this time?\n\n(Source: shinkeikaku)",
