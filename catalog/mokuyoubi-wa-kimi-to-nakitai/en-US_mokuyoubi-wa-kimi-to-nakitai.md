## Sinopse

On the outside, Kaoru Aikawa is a refined lady. But this life is not Kaoru's own, as he is living in the stead of his deceased twin sister. He finds solace in the company of his childhood friend Senmitsu and by admiring the model Reika Shimizu from afar. However, Reika too is hiding a secret, seen by Kaoru kissing another woman, yet also holding affection for Chiaki, a righteous boy from their university.

Everyone has a secret. For these four college students, their secrets bring them together, entwining their fates in a muddled knot of truth and lies.
