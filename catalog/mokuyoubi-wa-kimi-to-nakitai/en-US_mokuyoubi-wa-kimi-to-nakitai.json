He finds solace in the company of his childhood friend Senmitsu and by admiring the model Reika Shimizu from afar. However, Reika too is hiding a secret, seen by Kaoru kissing another woman, yet also holding affection for Chiaki, a righteous boy from their university.\n\nEveryone has a secret. For these four college students, their secrets bring them together, entwining their fates in a muddled knot of truth and lies.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
