## Sinopse

Princess Alita must protect her kingdom from a coup d'etat. But on her way to get help, a magical mishap trapped her inside the body of a bounty hunter named Falis. Now Alita must rule disguised as a servant as the battle-savvy Falis sits on the throne in her body.

And thus the story about the strongest and most violent princess in the history of the kingdom begins.
