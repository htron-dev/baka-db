## Sinopse

This is the story of several harem girls for a new ruler. The most beautiful is the silver-haired, large-chested Relenia, but she has a lot of rough edges in terms of her personality. She can jump extremely high, and she was recruited for the harem in exchange for tax exemption for her family, and the promise of a cat of her very own. Martena is very anxious about not losing out to Relenia, though she seems to end up quite often in sexually charged situations with Relenia and another girl, Edel. The three of them navigate their life in the harem together!
