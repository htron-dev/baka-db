## Sinopse

When 29-year-old Meguru moves into his deceased mother's home, he meets a high school boy wearing... a skirt. Meguru, who happens to be his neighbor and a friend of his mother, is trying to discover himself and help his own mother accept him for what he really is, feeling glad there is someone finally who can support him.

During this phase of self-discovery, they start getting closer as both of them slowly deal with their own problems.
