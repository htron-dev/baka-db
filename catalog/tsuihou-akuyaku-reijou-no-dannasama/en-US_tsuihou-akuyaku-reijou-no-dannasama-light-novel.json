    "sinopse": "\"I\" had the luck of being the one who reached out towards the young lady whose engagement was annulled by Prince Alephaldo, Elana. The day after the annulment, I was banished with her and married even though we dated for exactly 0 days. Well, it's just a slow country lifestyle of banishment in the neighboring country! Or so I thought, but...? This is my story about becoming a banished villainess's husband.\n\n(Source: Hakusensha, translated)",
