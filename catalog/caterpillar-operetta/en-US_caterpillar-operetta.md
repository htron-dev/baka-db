## Sinopse

Shy Yanahara Taichi wants to be a voice actor, so he joins the closest thing he can find, which is the theater club at his high school. The three girls of the club, big-breasted Shinobu, aloof Sae, and president Manaka are surprised to finally have a boy join up. They've decided to help him become an actor and are going to start by forcing him to overcome his shyness with girls.
