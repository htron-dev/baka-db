## Sinopse

Ami is a normal school girl. One day with her friends, she got stopped for an interview by a camera crew who thought Ami was really cute.

Shortly afterwards, Ami meets a blond boy who goes to her school named Nozomu. He seems to show some interest in her too. However, after she went to the 'Darwin', a group of two boy singers, concert, she met another Nozomu.

Very soon after the encounter with Darwin, she then got roped into the entertainment world as there were many people already interested in her from her live interview, who she later also became interested in.
