Ayase Minori is a new student entering Houjou Designer's College. She has had her design "Daisy" stolen by a top-class designer Hinagata Eiji when she was 5 years old, and Minori had sworn to the fact that "I will not fall in love before I can beat Hinagata Eiji!" However, her meeting with Himemiya Akira almost made her forget her old vow...while Akira is Hinagata Eiji's only-son! (Source: Endless Dimension)
