## Sinopse

The paragon of all noblewomen, Rachel Fergusen—wrongfully accused of harassment by her fiancé, Crown Prince Elliot—is thrown into a dark prison cell. Little does he know, this is all going exactly according to Rachel's plan! Organized by herself beforehand, her cell is furnished with the finest foods, the most comfortable furniture, and even better, no one can enter it to take these luxuries away!

From throwing a housewarming party in her cell to going out to town for a jaunt, Rachel is experiencing the most carefree life she has had in a long time. No matter what tricks her ex-fiancé, his girlfriend, or his subordinates try to use to ruin her day, Rachel is always one step ahead, enjoying a leisurely, slow prison life.
