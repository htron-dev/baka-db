Little does he know, this is all going exactly according to Rachel's plan! Organized by herself beforehand, her cell is furnished with the finest foods, the most comfortable furniture, and even better, no one can enter it to take these luxuries away!\n\nFrom throwing a housewarming party in her cell to going out to town for a jaunt, Rachel is experiencing the most carefree life she has had in a long time.
