    "sinopse": "A vacation fling was completely out of character for old-fashioned Carol, but her attraction to intriguing, older Marius tempted her to break her own rules. The next thing she knew, though, he'd turned up working at her hospital! Does she have what it takes to attract-much less keep the attentions of-this intimidating, sophisticated, and utterly compelling man?\n\n(Source: Dark Horse)",
