    "sinopse": "A \"kamuro\" is a young girl who takes care of and runs various errands for a courtesan, and at the same time studies the art for herself. The way kamuro would refer to their respective courtesans as \"big sister\" gave rise to the word \"oiran\", the most elite courtesans in Edo-era Japan. This story takes place in a brothel called Shinkiro in notorious Yoshiwara red-light district, starring an oiran known to many as the \"Courtesan from Hell\", a super popular sadist specialist named Hashidate. Her personal kamuro, Namiji, narrates the story, and paints a picture of Hashidate that most would never expect. A variety of customers, including townsfolk, samurai, and high-rollers, are in full force as Namiji recounts these fantastic tales!\n\n(Source: Media Do International/Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha)",
