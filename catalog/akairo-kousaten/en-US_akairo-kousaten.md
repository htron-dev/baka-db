## Sinopse

Akairo Kousaten is a lighthearted school-life romance about timid but friendly high schooler Keita, trying to become better friends with his classmate Tamaki who has always been cold to him ever since they met on the first day of school. When Tamaki confesses that she can see the "red string of fate" and that the reason she tries to avoid is because he is her partner, Keita pledges they will always be "just friends."
