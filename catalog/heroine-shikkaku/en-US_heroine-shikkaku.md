## Sinopse

Constantly gauging the roles of others, Hatori Matsuzaki has always been the main character, so it's only fitting that she be the heroine for her crush and childhood friend, Rita Terasaka. Even though he has girlfriends, she is convinced that she is the only "right" person for him and that they will eventually be together.

This is the narrative Hatori has followed her entire life. However, her whole world is thrown into chaos when Rita begins paying attention to their classmate Miho Adachi, a plain and unassuming wallflower, and they soon start dating. Hatori begins to question the nature of her reality: has she been the side character the whole time?
