    "sinopse": "When love comes to town, the lives of four socially maladapted teens are turned upside down when rotating attractions, comedic misunderstandings, and general chaos forces them to reconsider everything they've ever known about relationships, trust, and the frailties of the human heart. Fortunately, none of them knew very much in the first place.",
