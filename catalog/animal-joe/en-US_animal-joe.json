    "sinopse": "Murakami Shou has been putting years of blood and sweat into G&G Gold, a large banking company. He came up from nothing, worked insanely hard and now lives very comfortably, even having Rei, the hottest girl in the company, as his girlfriend.\n\nBut all that starts to slip away when Kirishima Joe comes into the company. With his handsome looks, impeccable style, calm demeanor and well endowed manhood, Joe has been upstaging Shou in every aspect of his life. And when Joe takes Rei away from him, Shou snaps and takes any measure to destroy Joe's life. But Joe has a secret that makes him hard to break.\n\n(Source: MU)",
