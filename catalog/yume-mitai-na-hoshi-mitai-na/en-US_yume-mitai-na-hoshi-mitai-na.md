## Sinopse

Meiji Aporo's just started attending Saint Richard Academy, a girls' boarding school. Unfortunately, Aporo's kind of a massive ditz, which annoys her roommate Chiroru to no end. Not one to be discouraged though, Aporo does her best to win Chiroru over or maybe drive her crazy. Whichever comes first.
