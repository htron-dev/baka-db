    "sinopse": "Mebuki Akira is a negotiator. Not the kind that works on international diplomacy, or hostage crises, or things like that, but one who helps everyday people solve small problems with loan sharks or annoying neighbors. But then one day, his former kouhai, Hyoudou Juetsu, who is now a big-time yakuza belonging to a group that claims control over the area Mebuki's office is in, shows up unexpectedly, offering his protective services for the office. Hyoudou is openly gay and totally in love with Mebuki (although, being a typical yakuza, he is not very good at showing it), but Mebuki hates yakuza and doesn't want anything to do with him. Oh, also, he's kind of pissed at Hyoudou for raping him in high school. Also also, Hyoudou is only trying to get Mebuki's office under yakuza protection because he's secretly trying to protect Mebuki from Uzawa, who is from a rival group and also happened to attend their high school.",
