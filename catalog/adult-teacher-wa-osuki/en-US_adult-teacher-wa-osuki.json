    "sinopse": "When frisky high school student Yuhi started dating his hot math teacher Watari, he thought there’d be more…dates. It seems the two can only connect in the bedroom, and Watari Sensei’s open disdain for mushy romance baffles Yuhi. How can the smitten student convince his cool, collected teacher that “it’s real”? He’s not the only insecure one: a short seme feels inadequate with his exceptionally tall lover, a grouchy guy can’t ask his crush out, a cat-boy in heat experiences puppy love, and a misunderstanding between childhood friends leads to romance.\n\n(Source: SuBLime)",
