## Sinopse

My mother told me fairy tales weren't real...yet now I'm a princess!

One day at a London airport, secretary Natalie encounters a woman who looks exactly like her. She turns out to be the princess of a kingdom in the Mediterranean, and the prince she is betrothed to is a notorious playboy on the cover of every tabloid. Wanting to experience a life of freedom before her wedding, the princess and Natalie decide to switch places temporarily. "This prince needs to be taught a lesson. I'll put him in his place!" says a resolved Natalie, but when she meets Prince Rodolfo, she is swept away by him...
