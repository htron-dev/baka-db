    "sinopse": "It is 217, the third century, and for several decades it has been \"the age in which the human race is happiest.\" Rome is the world's most powerful empire but it is increasingly troubled by political corruption, barbarian intrusion, and impending impoverishment due to continual foreign campaigns. Slowly but surely its power is waning and being lost, and with the assassination of Emperor Caracalla everything begins to change.",
