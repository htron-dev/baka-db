    "sinopse": "Riki has been reassigned to a different department in the police department. Riki, disliking paperwork, is glad to hear that he doesn't have to do any paperwork since his new assignment is to test drive a new vehicle secretly invented within the department. The new vehicle, however is beyond Riki's imagination; a talking car covered with a mascot girl on all sides. The car is a \"Patrol Car with Artificial Intelligence and Technical Illustration\" named Pattie 2000 and it talks like a human. A car that can talk, react to situations quickly, and has all sorts of technological advancements such as maps appearing on glass........and it can transform into a girl!?!? Technology is grand, isn't it?\n\n(Source: Mamo)",
