## Sinopse

The story follows Kiyotake, a man with no aim or accomplishments in life. He's an actor who lands extra roles at best, works multiple part-time jobs to barely support himself, and has few personal attachments. His best friend Shun died when he was 19 in an accident and he now has a few casual friends. This expands when an old acquaintance moves in next door...
