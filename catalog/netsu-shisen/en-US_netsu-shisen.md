## Sinopse

1. Feverish Eyes (Netsu Shisen)
   Kaoru fell in love at first sight with the boy who rides the bus with her, but she's never gotten up the nerve to talk to him. When he starts dating one of her friends, is the end of all hope?

2. Love the Whole Body

3. Forever Just the Two of Them

4. Flower of Longing (Katsubau no Hana) There's a rumor going around that Iida is in love with Inaba, but she wouldn't like such a shallow, perverted guy, would she? Now he's her next door neighbor, and he seems determined to find out if the rumor's true.
