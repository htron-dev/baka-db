## Sinopse

One day, due to God's mistake, Tomoaki Akino's life was accidentally snatched away. Though he gratefully accepted the cheat offered as an apology and reincarnated, he was reborn as a female elf! Then time passed, and Tomoaki now works as the intelligent and beautiful receptionist named Ilya in the Lunéville branch of the Guild Association. In a world of swords and magic, her job in the guild begins today.
