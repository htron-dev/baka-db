    "sinopse": "Breakout actor, Izumi Hayato, is charismatic and energetic in front of the camera but once the cameras are off Izumi becomes an expressionless antisocial person. Because of his introverted personality, Izumi's manager, Miyano Souta always has a hard time dealing with him.\n\nUnbeknownst to others, Izumi's icy personality isn't intentional. And despite his cold personality, costar Saotome Hijiri still attempts to get close to Izumi. Soon, the cheerful Saotome's personality starts to have an effect on Izumi, but not one that he expects or one Saotome's manager wants. Can Izumi overcome his ineptness in communicating long enough to express his love to Saotome and win Saotome's heart? (manga-updates)",
