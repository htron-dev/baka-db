    "sinopse": "Kon and Waki were best friends, before Kon's confession drove Waki to avoid him. Separated when they entered different high schools, Waki hopes things can go back to how they were before. Why, then, is he so upset to see Kon being friendly with a cute girl? Normal best friends wouldn't be like that... would they?\n\n(Source: DMG)",
