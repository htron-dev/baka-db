## Sinopse

A collection of one-shots by manga-ka Kawahara Kazune.

Platinum Snow:
Takae and Emiko are classmates vacationing together at a ski lodge during their winter break. Takae was hoping to quietly nurse a broken heart there, but it turns out that Ono-kun, the guy who rejected her, is also staying at the same lodge with some friends. On top of that, Emiko bumps into Nao, her childhood friend and long-time crush, but is that a girlfriend that he is with? What will happen to the four of them during their week-long stay?

Majo no Goyoujin:
In middle school, Hoshino Miharu stole Mori Kayo's crush and began dating him. Miharu told Kayo that it was an accident, completely without malicious intent, which was why Kayo forgave her. They are now high school classmates and still good friends, but now that Kayo has told Miharu about her new crush on Sanada, will history repeat itself?
