## Sinopse

The one-year-younger, cry-baby, childhood friend, Kanade, suddenly took Meguru's first kiss! Though he's grown taller a bit recently, and the girls made a big fuss and called him "the piano prince," I will not be tricked. He's a pervert who steals another guy's lips!

This manga skips a few years ahead of the ending of Kusatta Kyoushi no Houteishiki... Now it's time for the kids to shine!
