## Sinopse

Salaryman Kudou becomes aware of carpenter Satou in the middle of a mixer. Even though he gives off a calm vibe and is popular with the women, Satou's piercing gaze is fathomless. On top of that, he calls out to Kudou asking, "Am I your type?" and ends with sharing that he thought Kudou was gay. Despite his disrespectful attitude, Kudou is still conscious of Satou. He uncharacteristically gets drunk, and before he realizes it, he's at a hotel! Unable to avoid Satou, who closes the distance between them, Kudou is pushed down. Satou whispers, as if seeing right through him: "You could have left whenever you wanted, but you didn't. Aren't you curious to know just how I'll do it to you?"
