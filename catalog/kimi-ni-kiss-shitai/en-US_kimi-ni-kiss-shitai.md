Makita Tsukasa and Himuro Takashi have been best friends for a long time. All the girl suspect that they are "homos" because they are always together, but they both deny it. But when Makita get a confession, Himuro acts strangely. A rumor spreads around that Himuro and another GUY kissed. Is this the truth or is it simply girls gossiping about what they wish to happen?
