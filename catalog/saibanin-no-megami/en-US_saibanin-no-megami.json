    "sinopse": "This is a courtroom drama based on the relatively new Japanese jury system, in which a mixed panel of laypersons and professional judges hear criminal cases and determine guilt and sentencing. The young, pretty Yuuki Michiko is moving from Tokyo to a small coastal town to take up the position of an assistant judge. Right away, they begin the selection of a diverse group of people to serve as the lay judges for a murder case! It's Michiko's job to help guide them through the trial, without overly influencing them with her opinions. How will this group of citizens cope with passing judgment on people that they don't even know?\n\n(Source: MU)",
