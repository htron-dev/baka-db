## Sinopse

The story centers around a girl who discovers that there is a god living in her town. "Ikigami-sama," a god from far away and long ago, has come to her peaceful rural town on the sea coast. Ikigami-sama just happens to look like a scruffy, homeless, unemployed man. The manga follows the slightly odd everyday life of the mortal girl and the not-so-mortal guy.
