## Sinopse

A young man, Hanabishi Nao who is blessed with the phenomenal capability to sense the coming danger, was employed to work for Takashino Kazusa as a bodyguard, the son of a prosperous family. Nao, however isn't suited for such a job due to his adorable looks. Instead of treating Nao like a defender, Kazusa thinks of making Nao his "pet". But just what kind of "pet" is Nao? Submissive? Domineering?
