## Sinopse

The MC Ukeru is a completely normal student. One day, he is caught by some men in black and sold off in an underground auction in an unknown place. As the highest bid was placed, he heard a voice: "3 million!" Will the MC be able to protect his butt from all the Mr. Perfects that keep coming at him one after the other?
