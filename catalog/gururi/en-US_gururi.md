## Sinopse

The story revolves around four main characters - regular old 10th graders, until they are chosen by a slip of Tatsuki's tongue to be the human masters of the ancient Four Gods! The four teens are chosen to battle and vanquish the servants of the Demon King, who has escaped from the celestial world to wreak havoc on Earth.
