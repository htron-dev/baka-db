    "sinopse": "Ichimiya Tsubasa is a 3rd year jr. high school student who just lost his single mother in a tragic accident. At her funeral, his relatives superficially fight over who will take him in, even though, it's obvious that they just want his inheritance rights. Suddenly, a mysterious guy appears, claiming to be his mother's secret second husband, but how is that possible when he is only 3 years older than Tsubasa...??\n\nNote: Also included in Vol. 2 is a one-shot titled \"Devilish\" about two princes from hell and a human girl who accidentally sees something she shouldn't have.",
