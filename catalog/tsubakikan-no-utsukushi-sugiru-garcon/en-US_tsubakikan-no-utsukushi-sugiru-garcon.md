## Sinopse

Yufuin Shizuka is a garçon at the Cafe Tsubaki-kan. He's gorgeous, elegant, and gives superb service. He just has one weakness— girls! Just looking into a girl's eyes or being touched is enough to completely fluster him. Unfortunately, the owner's granddaughter is going to be running the cafe, and when she finds out about his problem, she decides that he shouldn't be working there!
