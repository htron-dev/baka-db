    "sinopse": "\"You are not the real saint; you're nothing but a fake!\"\n\nI, Eliane, am suddenly exiled. Not only that, my engagement was also annulled by Claude, who was both my fiancé and the first prince of my country. Claude claims that Leticia is the \"real saint,\" but I know from the beginning, she is the woman he has been cheating on me with. So here I am, sharing his wish to cancel our engagement.\n\nBut is exiling me truly a wise decision, I wonder? Exiling this me, the actual \"real saint\" who has been setting up barriers and supporting this kingdom from shadows? Maybe, just maybe, dragons and archdemons will invade my kingdom starting from tomorrow. Who knows—not like it's any of my business anymore. I have abandoned my own country and have thus decided to have a peaceful life. Meanwhile, the kingdom, which has lost its true saint, is on the path to ruin.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
