    "sinopse": "In the year 2XXX, sex of any kind has been outlawed. The reproduction of humanity is strictly regulated by the government, which approves artificial inseminations based on the best combinations of DNA to produce genetically favorable children.\n\nShino Iwase is just another member of the masses brought up in this society. But one day she receives a strange proposition from a handsome man named Yamato Amagi: come to the fifth district to learn the truth. What she encounters at an abandoned building is an unfathomable scene—women on men and men on women, caught in the throes of pleasure. Shino is bewildered by these acts, but Yamato promises to teach her the intricacies of sex and what it means to love.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
