    "sinopse": "Suzu is a 17-year-old high school student living in a rural village with her father. For years, she has only been a shadow of herself. One day, she enters \"U,\" a virtual world of five billion members on the Internet. There, she is not Suzu anymore but Belle, a world-famous singer. She soon meets with a mysterious creature. Together, they embark on a journey of adventures, challenges, and love, in their quest to become who they truly are.\n\nRyuu to Sobakasu no Hime tells a fantastical, yet beautiful and contemporary thematic story of one girl's growth in the age of social media.\n\n(Source: GKIDS, edited)",
