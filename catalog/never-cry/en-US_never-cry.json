    "sinopse": "Joeun remembers everything that turned her life upside down. She remembers the man who helped her out at the darkest of times, who abandoned her while calling her cursed. She remembers her prince, who she had her first kiss with at the age of eight. He, too, abandoned her in one day. She remembers the strange black haired man who beat her mother up. Everyone said that she was cursed, and she wants to prove them wrong. Eight years later, Joeun finds a wallet. She is going to turn it in when her friend is caught by a gangster and lots of money is needed to save her. But the wallet owner sees everything, and decides that Joeun is his next target for revenge. But the wallet owner seems to be a cross-gender freak.\n\n(Source: MangaUpdates)",
