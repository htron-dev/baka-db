That's Fu Arisugawa, an office worker too busy with her shopping spoils and whose motto is \"Shopping is Living.\" Meanwhile, for reasons she doesn't understand yet, she's interested in her cool-tempered and reserved boss. And there are her friends, too. Rio, who keeps her feelings towards Fu a secret; Mizuho, who always ends up dating losers; and Enjoji, who keeps interviewing University of Tokyo grads for an arranged marriage... Each are lost in their own way while searching for happiness. These four Alices wander through their lives of love... and shopping!!\n\n(Source: Kodansha Comics USA)",
