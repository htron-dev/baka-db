## Sinopse

Bravely Default revolves around four young heroes of Luxendarc: the wind vestal, Agnès Oblige, who finds the wind crystal consumed in darkness; a mysterious vagrant named Ringabel with no memory of his past; Edea Lee of the Duchy of Eternia, who is sent on a mission to protect the world from a great evil; and a youth named Tiz Arrior who witnesses his brother and his hometown Norende being swallowed up by a great chasm.

Coming to a week after Norende's destruction in the city of Caldisla, Tiz attempts to find survivors in the Norende Ravine. But he instead finds Agnès and Airy, a cryst-fairy who appears to be helping the vestal awaken the crystals out of their corruption which is causing natural calamities across Luxendarc. But Agnès is being pursued by the Knights of the Eternian Sky, who have been terrorizing Caldisla, and aim to keep the crystals from being awakened. Though Agnès refused his aid at first, Tiz manages to convince her to let him help her in her quest. Soon after, the two are joined by Ringabel and Edea, the latter disgusted with the Sky Knights' dishonorable actions while amazed to find the vestal not to be as evil as she was raised to believe.
