## Sinopse

In the ancient House of Nekogami, sibling rivalry is a game of life and death.

The patriarch of the Nekogami family is dead, and his grandson Sukekiyo is the rightful heir. There is just one problem - Sukekiyo is away at war, whereabouts unknown. Only one person can inherit the fortune, and the triplets Yoki, Koto and Kiku aren't going to let Sukekiyo's fiancee, Tamayo, walk off with prize. With a fortune at stake, it's kill or be killed as the Nekogami family goes up against demons, thieves and each other to protect the family... and the cash!
