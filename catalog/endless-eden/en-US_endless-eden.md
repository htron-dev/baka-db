## Sinopse

Angela wakes up in an abandoned warehouse. Confused and dazed, she has no memory of her past or any concrete idea about how she got there. Angela through a series of seemingly inconceivable events, Angela learns that she has been chosen as the next vessel for the great demon queen. The only thing preventing the queen from taking over her mind and body is her virginity. Will Angela be able to avoid temptation or will the Demon Queen Lilion be unleashed to ravish the Earth?
