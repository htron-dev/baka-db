## Sinopse

Coco is the naive girl and the granddaughter of a famous pirate, living on an isolated island. One day she saved a sword-cat, Bakado, who claimed to be the partner of her grandfather. Both of them have Garudia (enchanted jewels having magic power). Upon Bakado's persuasion, they started off on a journey, hunting Garudia.
