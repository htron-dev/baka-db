## Sinopse

Susami, down on his luck, receives the gift of kindness from Hashiba. Susami is overwhelmed by this simple act and finds himself unable to think of anything else. When Hashiba runs away from, Susami tries to drown his pain in alcohol, but Hashiba’s face haunts him. Frustrated, he leaves the bar to find Hashiba being lured into a trap. Susami rescues Hashiba and takes him to a park where he waxes eloquent and confesses his love to Hashiba.
