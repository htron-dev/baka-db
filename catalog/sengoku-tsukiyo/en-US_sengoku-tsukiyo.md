## Sinopse

Masayoshi Kurozuka is an ordinary high school boy...until the day he discovers that he is the reincarnation of an evil woman named Oni-hime, who sold her soul to the devil during Japan's warring period.

Masayoshi must come to grips with his identity, all the while fighting off legions of ghosts—the remnants of men killed by Oni-hime. In order to free himself from this curse, Masayoshi must discover the truth behind Oni-hime's deal with the devil and clear her name in the eyes of the restless spirits seeking revenge.
