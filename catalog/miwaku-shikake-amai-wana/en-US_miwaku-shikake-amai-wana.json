    "sinopse": "Amami's a low-man on the totem pole at a tiny start-up firm—and his superior Hachidori really seems to have it out for him. They've got history themselves, which helps nothing, but one evening, Amami learns Hachidori's deepest, darkest secret…which tilts his impression of the guy on its head.\n\n(Source: MU)",
