## Sinopse

TSUTSUMI Mayuko is not a very good teacher. Her students talk back to her a lot, and she has a hard time controlling her class. Sho HASUDA is one of her students. He is a troubled guy who drinks too much and mixes alcohol with pills. He is bitter and has a lot of issues relating to a bad childhood. Mayuko tries to help him, and they end up in a forbidden relationship. A much more serious take on the teacher-student relationship story. (Source: http://piffleprincess.com/sakai)
