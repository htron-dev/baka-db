## Sinopse

Eitoku Academy has a legacy of being a school for the ultimate elite, the best of the best. And the most rich and powerful students there have formed the Correct 5 clique to maintain the integrity of their school. Unfortunately, new student Oto Edogawa doesn't have the pedigreed background of her peers and has to work part-time jobs to help make ends meet. Will a chance encounter with Haruto Kaguragi, the leader of the Correct 5, put everything at risk?
