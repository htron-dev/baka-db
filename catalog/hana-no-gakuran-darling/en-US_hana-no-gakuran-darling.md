## Sinopse

I, Daimonji Kiku have always been played a fool by lady luck (probably), since I've fallen madly in love with the cheer club captain Asaka Teppei. He takes over the club from his senpai alone and vows to protect it. His tough and stoic appearance just makes him irresistible. One day, he falls sick and seeing his weak form, I couldn't help but kiss him! Then, at that moment I managed to see an erotic face of his! Because of the cool yet shy Teppei, my hot passion in me was lighted...!
