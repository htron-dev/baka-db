## Sinopse

Noda-sensei sends me a signal from the other side of his cold, silver-rimmed glasses. "This will appear on the test. Remember this?" But Sensei, is that really the signal you wish to send me?

Teacher and pupil, teacher and alumni, upper-and underclassmen, classmates who were childhood friends; drawn here are various love affairs born and growing inside the schoolhouse.

A collection of Sakae Kusama's masterpieces for you to read through, loaded with original drawings!
