    "sinopse": "In the 22nd century, there are no longer any world wide wars. Instead, small scale wars break out all over the Earth. Meanwhile, a large robot appears who protects the weak. It is called \"Dancougar Nova\". Some even call it God.\n\nHowever, no one knows the reason for its existence - not even its pilots.\nThen, another robot, beyond anyone's expectations, reveals itself as the true enemy and begins its attack on the Earth.\n\nDancougar Nova retaliates against this enemy with a power that was kept secret until now. Will Dancougar Nova be able to save the Earth? The prelude to this explosive confrontation rings out.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",
