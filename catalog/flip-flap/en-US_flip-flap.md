## Sinopse

The story is about a twenty-year-old guy named Tsukuba Furio who wanders into an arcade to use the restroom. He walks by, sees a girl furiously playing pinball, watches her, and falls in love. Her name is Furinami Hikaru, and since she is a regular at the arcade, our hero-in-love decides to get a job there. Furio loves Hikaru, but Hikaru loves pinball. Who will give in to whom? Well, it’s not quite that simple, there’s also a big (or “small”) twist.
