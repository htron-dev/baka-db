    "sinopse": "Huoli Shaonian Wang is a Chinese multi-media franchise created to sell yoyo toys to children. Huoli Shaonian Wang 3 is the first animated season in the franchise but the 3rd story chronologically.\n\nThe show focuses on competitive schools that hold yo-yo contests. Each team has their own issues that they solve. Each yoyo has a name that reflects the toy's design. The show makes use of minor special effects in order to portray magic/spirit/chi and the speed of the yoyo. These \"magic spells\" are \"battling\" and the person whose \"magic\" remains, wins.\n\n(Source: Wiki)",
