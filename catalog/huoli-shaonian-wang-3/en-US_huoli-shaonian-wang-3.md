## Sinopse

Huoli Shaonian Wang is a Chinese multi-media franchise created to sell yoyo toys to children. Huoli Shaonian Wang 3 is the first animated season in the franchise but the 3rd story chronologically.

The show focuses on competitive schools that hold yo-yo contests. Each team has their own issues that they solve. Each yoyo has a name that reflects the toy's design. The show makes use of minor special effects in order to portray magic/spirit/chi and the speed of the yoyo. These "magic spells" are "battling" and the person whose "magic" remains, wins.
