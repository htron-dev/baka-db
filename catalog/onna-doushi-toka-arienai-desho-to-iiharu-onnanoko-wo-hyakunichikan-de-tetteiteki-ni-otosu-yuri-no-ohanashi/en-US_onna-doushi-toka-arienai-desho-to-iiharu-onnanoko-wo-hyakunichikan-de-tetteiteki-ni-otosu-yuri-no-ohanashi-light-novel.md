## Sinopse

"Girls going out with girls? That can't be! But..."

One day, Marika Sakakibara, a popular high school girl, was offered one million yen by her beautiful classmate, Aya Fuwa.

"Sakakibara-san, I will buy you for 10000 yen a day for one hundred days. Let us see if girls going out with girls really cannot be."

"H-Huh?!"

From that day, their after school xx time began.
