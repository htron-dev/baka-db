An ordinary big brother who's adopted, Souji, who plays the good kid and doesn't get angry no matter what is done to him. The only thing that upsets this big brother is the unexpected kiss. The mask of the older brother who never shows his true self was finally peeled off... Or so he thought but...\n\n\"I have no plans to cut ties with you, Aniki.\" Jin raged when Souji suddenly said he's moving out!? He tied up his resisting older brother and stirred his tongue inside his flaming mouth. Huh? It's strange...? He can't stop getting excited by everything about Souji...\n\nA sadistic type yandere (sweet and gentle yet brutal) younger brother x kojirase (someone who's not confident about their self) type ill-fated older brother, and their forbidden-obsessive love!!\n\n(Source: Amutus, translated)",
