## Sinopse

Narugami Kyoko is a 14-year-old girl with extraordinarily high amounts of static electricity. She shorts out electronics, shocks people, frizzes out people's hair, and makes their clothes full of static. Understandably, most people at school avoid her, except for her friend Hikari. This 4-koma style manga features her humorous everyday school life as she hangs out with Hikari, interacts with teachers, and tries to become closer to her other classmates despite her electricity problem!
