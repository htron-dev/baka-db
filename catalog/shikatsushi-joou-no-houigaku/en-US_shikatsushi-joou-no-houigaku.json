    "sinopse": "Hajime Inukai is a student at the H University medical school, and she dreams of becoming a clinical doctor. However, for some reason, she's been assigned to work in a forensic medical science lab, under a weird, but incredibly skilled, associate professor called Kiriyama Yuki. Hajime hadn't expected her 'patients' to be corpses undergoing an autopsy, and she most certainly didn't expect the first case she attended to with Kiriyama would be the apparent suicide of a girl she knew. During their investigation of the case, Hajime also began to see flashes of the dead girl, as if she had come back to life for mere moments. Will Hajime be able to handle her time in forensic medicine, and work her way back to having living patients?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
