## Sinopse

High school student Haae-Won (Alice) Song has just placed third in Cake Magazine’s manwha creator talent search. She’s the youngest winner in the history of the contest! Not only does she have her story published but she also gets the chance to work with one of her manwha idols (who has a surprise for her). And as if that wasn’t reward enough, she’s also reunited with the former teacher who inspired her winning story. What happens when personalities clash and hearts collide like something out of a comic book? Does art imitate life, or is it the other way around? [Ice Kunion/Yen Press]
