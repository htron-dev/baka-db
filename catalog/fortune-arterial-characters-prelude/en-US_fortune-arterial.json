    "sinopse": "Kouhei Hasekura is a sophomore who transfers into a prestigious public schoolâ€”an English style six-year school, serving junior high and high school students. The school, named Shuchikan Academy, is on an island, Tamatsu Island, off-shore from mainland Japan, and the only way to get there is by boat. But under the peaceful surface, this prestigious academy holds a dark secret. Some of its students are vampires! And Kouhei will be dragged deeper and deeper into the mystery of the school and the girls that attend.\n\n(Source: MU)",
