## Sinopse

When I noticed, I was surrounded by a bunch of people wearing kimonos. When I looked into the river water, what was there was a young child... Eh, it's me!? The place where I washed ashore was a gaudy neighborhood, Yoshiwara. Huh? But it looks like the ones behind the lattice are men.

The one who picked up the still young me from that strange place was an old man from a brothel called the "Amazuki Brothel." The place I was brought to was a red light district filled with men. It seems that over here, men who had no choice but to become prostitutes were called yuudan (male courtesan). Then I was given the name Nogiku and made to hide from the female customers and provide assistance. For some reason I was also given courtesan training, but I'm not male!! I don't want to learn how to seduce women!!
