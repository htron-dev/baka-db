    "sinopse": "Jinta Yadomi spends most of his days at home, indifferent to his school and social life after a tragic accident tore his childhood friendship group apart. Years later, Jinta is confronted by his past in the form of a ghost—Meiko \"Menma\" Homa—which forces him to face the guilt he has been shouldering since her death.\n\nMenma reveals that she has a wish that may help her move on; however, she has forgotten what it was, and insists that she needs the whole group back together to remember. Will Jinta be able to reunite his estranged friends and convince them that what he's saying is true?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
