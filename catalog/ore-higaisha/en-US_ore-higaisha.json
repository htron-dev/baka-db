    "sinopse": "Ria, a university student, is threatened by the father he never knew. \"I hate people like you! Your fate is to die,\" said the father with an undisguised persecution complex. To escape this hurt, I'll do only enjoyable things till my end! He argues, in his extreme desperation. His father, in the midst of his delusions, propositions his virgin son, saying, \"Do you want to have sex?\" while he takes off his clothes. Then, little by little, he begins to find the suffering face of his father cute?! \"Welcome home! The rice will be done in 30 minutes, so shall we have sex?\" \"You should hurry up and escape from here…!\" Can love bloom in this lifestyle of confinement? An incredible five-chapter compilation by the one and only Kimura Hidesato!\n\n(Source: Ebil Trio & MbE)",
