    "sinopse": "Asuka Masamune is a badass. Really. He is a tough, cool, 2nd year high school guy who is also a master at kendo. He exudes an aura of manliness that is difficult to deny. Everyone at school admires him. But for Asuka, life is torture. You see, he can never show the _real_ Asuka to the world. While he is phenomenal at kendo, and looks very cool, Asuka is living a lie. He actually prefers much more girly things: knitting, cooking, sewing, shoujo manga, plushies, cute things—he loves them all. When he was a child, this worried his mother very much, as Asuka's father abandoned the family after declaring he wanted to be a woman. The shock made his mother so ill that Asuka swore to become a more manly man.\n\nPoor Asuka. Bound to this promise, he goes through his life acting macho and cool, when all the while he would much rather read the latest Hana to Mame comic at the book store and dream of a shoujo manga romance. When Asuka rescues a female classmate, Ryou Miyakozuka, from some bullies, he instantly falls in love with her, and his desire for cute things and sparkly shoujo romance is reawakened!\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 10: Glass no Otomen: Sen no Kamen wo Motsu Otomen\nVolume 11: Love-Tic",
