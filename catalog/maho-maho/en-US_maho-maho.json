She's become an idol of the country even though no one knows anything about her. Shinjouji Hazumu's sister, Akane, is a giant Magical Hop fan. Even his best friend, Ootori, and his crush, Mononobe Komari, are infatuated with her. What none of them know is that the idol witch is actually Hazumu. He has been assigned this task by his mom and has to keep the secret while solving cases if he doesn't want everyone in the country to think he is a cross dressing pervert!\n\n(Source: MU)",
