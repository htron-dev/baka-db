## Sinopse

Welcome to the Ability Society. A futuristic world where no one has an advantage from the abilites they were born with, because you can easily download abilites. These downloadable abilites, called "Labels," will give you the skills to do just about anything. From driving a car to making pottery, the sky's the limit.
