## Sinopse

Every day is boring, too boring... Until a witch casts her spell on it? Masa, a second-year student at a third-rate art school, draws because he doesn't know what else to do with his life. Then he meets Aoi, an attractive first-year girl, who seems, somehow, like she might be a witch. Will Aoi and her secrets light the fire in the gloomy Masa's heart? Though it doesn't seem much like living, life goes on, as young men yearn only for yearning. Though every day seems so inconsequential, the special spark of that time of life defines what it means to be young.
