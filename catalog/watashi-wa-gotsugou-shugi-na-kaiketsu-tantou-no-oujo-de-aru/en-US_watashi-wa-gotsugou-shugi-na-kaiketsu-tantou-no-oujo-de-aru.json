    "sinopse": "In her previous life, Octavia was a high school student fujoshi obsessed with the novel The Noble King, which took place in a world where homosexuality was the norm. Reborn into said novel, she is now the sole princess of Esfia, a supporting character who makes up for the fact that the main couple—Crown Prince Sirius and Baron's son Syl—cannot bear children. In short, her only purpose is to give birth to an heir.\n\nDespite being their biggest fan, Octavia does not want to waste her life away as a breeding tool. No, she will take hold of her own fate! She has always wanted her own love story, but there is a slight wrench in her plans: she can't find any straight men. Even if her escort knight, Klifford Alderton, is quite attractive, he's probably also gay... Unless?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
