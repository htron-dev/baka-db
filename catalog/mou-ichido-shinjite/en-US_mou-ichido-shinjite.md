## Sinopse

Helen loved her husband, Dan, from the bottom of her heart. The teenage sweethearts tied the knot two years ago, and their life together was wonderful. Until the day Helen came home from work early with a nasty cold... and found her half-naked husband with his secretary, Celine. When she wasn't home, it seems the two of them had been... She couldn't even think about it! Dan begged her to trust him. But what on earth was she supposed to believe!
