## Sinopse

In February 1970, Professor Ichinoseki of NG University, on the outskirts of Tokyo, is very depressed at his failure to discover the truth of the universe despite his 50 years of hard work. Just as he considers commiting suicide, a woman named Mephistopheles appears before him. It turns out that she is actually the Devil and Ichinoseki will make a bargain with her: Mephisto will serve him with her magic powers until he is fully satisfied and says "Stay, thou art so beautiful", at which point his soul will be claimed by her.

Mephisto takes him back to the year 1958 and has him take a rejuvenating drug, but now transformed into a handsome young man, he doesn't remember anything about who he is or how he got there.

After the professor saves him from being mugged, Sakane Daizo, president of Sakane Bussan Company, decides to take him under his wing and renames him Daiichi. Daizo loves Daiichi so much that he adopts him as his own child and make him the sole inheritor of his immense fortune. After Daizo dies of stomach cancer, Daiichi will use this money to achieve his dreadful ambition: to create living things for his own purposes...
