## Sinopse

Once a Japanese person. When she realized she was reincarnated, she was the daughter of a duke. Wait a minute, my fiancé is the crown prince? No matter how good looking he is, I definitely don't want to marry into the polygamous royal family. While thinking about a way to break off her engagement, Lidi came upon a ridiculous conclusion.

Will she be able to carry it out according to plan?
