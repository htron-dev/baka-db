Tastumi is a normal boy going to school and living with his strict older brother. Orphaned at a young age, his brother has been both a mother and a father to him. One day, he and his friends are about to rescue a beautiful girl from being harrassed when she beats them up herself. When she sees Tatsumi, she suddenly calls him "Rui". What does this mean?
