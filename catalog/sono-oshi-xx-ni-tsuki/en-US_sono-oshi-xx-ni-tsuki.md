## Sinopse

"No problem. A man always keeps his word. We can do it as many times as you want." Sakiko Kotohira is a devoted yaoi fangirl and absolutely head over heels for Reiji, the cool, dominant protagonist of her favorite comic. One of the highlights of Sakiko's day is catching a glimpse of Masayuki Utazu, a coworker who happens to look just like Reiji. One day, distracted by her daydreams, Sakiko suddenly finds herself face-to-face with the office lookalike. He turns out to be even hotter than she'd imagined. Desperate for material to fuel future fantasies, Sakiko all but rips her clothes off and pounces on the guy. Masayuki's cool, imperial resolve melts away in a second. Further prompted by a secret reason of his own, Masayuki decides he has to have her!! Get ready for a showdown between two explosive desires, as well as a passionate battle of misunderstandings!
