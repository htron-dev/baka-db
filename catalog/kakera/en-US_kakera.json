    "sinopse": "Based on chapter one of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen. The original text depicts a disaster brought about by tools and technology. There is a connection between this theme and the nuclear power plant accident that occurred in Japan in 2011. Tsuji's film attempts to be an interleaving depiction of the original story and the real-life disaster.\n\n(Source: Vimeo)",
