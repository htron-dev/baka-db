## Sinopse

High school student Hotaru has never been in love. To her, it's a mysterious feeling, despite the advice of those around her, and she finds herself wishing she could experience it for herself... That is, until she meets Shinri - handsome, popular, and a shameless flirt - who offers to teach her about love. Could this be her chance to understand the mysterious feeling at last? And what, exactly, are Shinri's intentions?
