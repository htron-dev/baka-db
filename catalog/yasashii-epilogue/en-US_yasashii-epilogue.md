## Sinopse

Kouda's job in Tokyo didn't go well and now he lives as a cafeteria worker back in the country side. One day, he meets Nojima, who moves into the neighborhood, and becomes close with him, but finds out he's the leader of the notorious Nojima group! But contrary to his reputation, Nojima asks Kouda to eat with him every day, and he can't seem to sleep by himself because of the rumors that ghosts might appear in his house.
