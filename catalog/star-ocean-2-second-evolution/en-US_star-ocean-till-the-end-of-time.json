    "sinopse": "Twelve heroes thwarted the Ten Wise Men's plot to destroy the universe. Four hundred years have since passed. The date is SD 772. The Pangalactic Federation has already explored one third of the Milky Way, and continues to research in its insatiable quest for even more power. In that time, the young Earthling Fayt Leingod and his family visit Hyda, a resort planet in the Pangalactic Federation when, suddenly, an unknown military space force attacks Hyda. The assault leaves buildings destroyed and the resort's natural surroundings in ruin. Amidst the chaos, Fayt attempts to escape with Sophia and the other resort guests to an emergency shelter, joining his parents along the way. But even their escape route falls under attack. Fayt manages to reach the shelter, but he is separated from his parents and Sophia...\n\n(Source: MU)",
