    "sinopse": "The Star Ocean: The Second Story manga, drawn by Mayumi Azuma, is based upon the Star Ocean: The Second Story video game developed by tri-Ace. It follows the storyline of the game, which follows the exploits of the two protagonists: Claude C. Kenni, a young ensign in the Earth Federation going on his first real mission with his father, and Rena Lanford, a young girl living in the rural village of Arlia on the planet Expel. Star Ocean EX, the anime series that retells the tale of the video game, is based upon this manga. The manga was never translated into English, and can only be found in Japanese.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
