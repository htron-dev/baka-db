## Sinopse

Yagi Naoyuki has always been able to get any woman he wanted, and to him, that has always been a problem. It's come to the point where they would take drastic measures if he rejected them. Fed up with his "women troubles," Naoyuki's parents send him to live with his uncle, Yagi Akira, whose sexuality is rather ambiguous. At the apartment complex, Naoyuki meets Yoshiro Kei, another one of the tenants and he can't help but be curious about Kei.
