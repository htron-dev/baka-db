    "sinopse": "Since entering high school, Hiro Ootaki has tried to avoid standing out by hiding his hobbies regarding 80s Japanese pop culture, although he manages to obtain a circle of friends and some popularity. To his surprise, Tomoyo Yakushimaru—a social outcast and fellow classmate—also shares the same interests.\n\nThe two begin meeting to indulge in their common passion, engaging in all kinds of activities based on this period, such as discussing music, dressing up, and even changing their hairstyles. This chance encounter leads to a truly special relationship as they gradually begin to fall in love.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
