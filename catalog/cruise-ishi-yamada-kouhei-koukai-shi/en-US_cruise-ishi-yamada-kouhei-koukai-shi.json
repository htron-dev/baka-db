    "sinopse": "Cruise is the story of Yamada Kohei, a doctor who gives up a landlubber medical career to serve as a ship's physician, and the people he meets on board Japan's largest luxury liner, the Phoenix. He rejects a university colleague's insistence that he turn to teaching instead, preferring to stay and learn about life as it happens from the ship's passengers.\n\nBig Comic serializes this \"beautifully sad human drama.\" One of the stories compiled in the first Cruise features a passenger suffering from terminal cancer. Only songs can lift his heart, heavy with regret.\n\n(Source: huamulan03.blogspot)",
