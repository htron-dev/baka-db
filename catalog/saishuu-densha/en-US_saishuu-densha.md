## Sinopse

Workaholic Natsume misses the last train of the day on the same day that another office worker, Miki, misses it. They end up going to a business hotel nearby, but for some reason end up staying in the same room. For Natsume, who is used to working through a computer, staying in the same room as someone else is a first and he finds it extremely difficult to get through it. Especially with the friendly and bright Miki, who tugs him into the bed with him as they spend the night in the room together. When the next day comes, Miki tells Natsume that he'd love to see him again...?
