    "sinopse": "A high school student who lived as a mob character, Mimori Touka. During the school trip, he and his classmates were summoned to another world. According to the summoning goddess, so many best ranked heroes like S and superior ranked ones like A were very unusual. Touka, however, was the only with the lowest rank: he was an E-rank hero, in the \"failure frame\" of the stepped pyramid frames. His status is overwhelming low when compared to his classmates. Moreover Touka’s peculiar skill — 【Abnormal State Skill】— looks like an absolute failure, so… like this, the former mob character and abandoned hero will absolutely become the strongest devil as he advances and strikes back.\n\n(Source: MU)",
