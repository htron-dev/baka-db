    "sinopse": "The story tells of a boy named Izumo who is the prince of Nakatsu a country where his uncle, Furune, is the king. He is a hot-blooded man full of justice, but he doesn't quite understand what his position entails; sometimes his behavior is somewhat overwhelming. It is then, assassins lurking in foreign merchant ships will take Furune for surprise.\n\n(Source: Benjanet, translated)",
