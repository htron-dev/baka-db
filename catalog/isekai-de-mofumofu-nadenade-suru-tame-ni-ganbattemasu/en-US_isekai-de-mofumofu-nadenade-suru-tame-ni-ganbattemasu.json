    "sinopse": "After various things happened, I got an ability from God and reincarnated to another world! While being watched over by my high-spec family, the super ordinary me fully enjoyed other world life. Using the ability I received from God, I had a daily life of just fluffing and petting fantasy animals. There are some shady movements too, but while being led by the nose by God, I'll do my best at various things with my cheat-like comrades!\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
