## Sinopse

Shiba, the once-loved dog of Taketora’s grandfather, comes back in the form of a human (yet with dog ears and tail intact) to repay the kindness his master showed to him. However, Taketora’s grandfather has passed away 20 years ago, so Shiba must shows his appreciation to him. Clumsy yet energetic, and eager to help around the house, how can Taketora not find this puppy-boy cute?
