The tournament is simple battle of capturing the enemy's flag, but the battle itself goes beyond any human measure. It is customary for a female to enter these battles. Carrying their pride and their flag, their only objective is to defeat their opponent.

Sit back and enjoy the story of Kikko's path to becoming queen of all hot-springs!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
