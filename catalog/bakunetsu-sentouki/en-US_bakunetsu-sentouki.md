## Sinopse

In order to determine which hot spring is to be the top overall, all of the hot springs within the region enter an unofficial tournament. The tournament is simple battle of capturing the enemy's flag, but the battle itself goes beyond any human measure. It is customary for a female to enter these battles. Carrying their pride and their flag, their only objective is to defeat their opponent. Hence they are commonly called "Fighting Spring Princesses." Kikko, the Fighting Spring Princess of the Aizen Hot Spring Temple, is an eccentric, hot-blooded person who is going to have her debut battle. Sit back and enjoy the story of Kikko's path to becoming queen of all hot-springs!
