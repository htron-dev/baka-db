Determined to keep his country-bumpkin status a secret, he tries to keep a low profile... but when his groundbreaking performance in his first test attracts the attention of not only his (gorgeous) classmates, but the Demon King herself... Chrono realizes his dreams of a \"happy, normal school life\" may die in the dungeons... just like him!\n\n(Source: Kodansha Comics USA)",
