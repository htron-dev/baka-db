## Sinopse

Kappei is a martial artist living in a secluded and isolated small island, among many young men led by a Master who have been training them vigorously in order to survive the July 1999 Apocalypse predicted by Nostradamus -- which never came. The Master finally gave up in 2011, disbanded the martial art camp and sent members back to modern day Japan. With no knowledge of the modern world, Kappei arrives in Tokyo and starts a new life: a hero without antagonists.
