    "sinopse": "He has blonde hair, menacing eyes, and a threatening demeanor—but third-year high school student Kinichirou Imamura is not a delinquent. Feared and friendless, he is also the reason that both he and female classmate Akira “Aki” Fujieda have their faces planted on the cold, hard floor on the day of their graduation.\n\nThe pair later awaken from the painful experience in their bedrooms. However, instead of graduation, they find themselves at their entrance ceremony, three years in the past. With no apparent way to return to the present, Imamura resolves to relive the high school life he missed out on, starting by joining the cheering club. But turning over a new leaf in the face of the difficult and boisterous club president Yoshiko Usami is easier said than done.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
