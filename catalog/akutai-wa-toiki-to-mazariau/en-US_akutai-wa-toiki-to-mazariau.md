“Do not deceive a person. Do not threaten a person. Do not handcuff people. Any illegal activity is forbidden.” This is an excerpt from the deal between Natsume the salarymen in sales and the college kid Touji. It all began with a little stalking, some handcuffs, and an unexpected night in the slammer. Where will this budding love lead? (Source: MangaUpdates)
