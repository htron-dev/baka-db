## Sinopse

In the year 2050 AD, Humans live in a world filled with science and electronics, but the "Demon Capital" Shanghai has never been rid of demons. Fortunately, the supernatural Demon Taoists Corporation is here to ensure that neither vampires, demigods, or even trans-cultural literary icons trouble the citizens...at least, for too long.
