Nagareboshi ni Kuchizuke (Kiss to the Shooting Star) -\n   Yawara and Chitose are childhood friends who are constantly arguing and teasing each other. Unbeknownst to Yawara, Chitose is in love with him, however she doesn't have the guts to confess. She assures herself by thinking that they live in the same appartment complex and that they will go to the same high school, which gives her all the time she needs.\n\nHowever, all that changes when Yawara announces to her that he'll be going to Kura High, which is 2 hours by train, instead of the same high school as her. What if he gets a girlfriend there? What will Chitose do!? (Source: Raining Mangas)\n\n3. Boy Don Quixote -\n   Hiro moved away 5 years ago. She and her childhood friend Ri-chan had promised to meet again and that he would fullfil his dream. And now they are going to the same school. Hiro thinks they will start up where they left off, but Ri-chan is acting very cold to her. (Source: Bad Eggs)\n\n4. Soprano\n\n5. Kyoukasho wo Toshitara (Textbook wo Toshitara)",
