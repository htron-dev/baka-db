## Sinopse

Haru loves her childhood friend Sagari, who is a model. But due to height differences, they are often referred to as brother & sister. But when Sagari realizes his feelings toward Haru, he wastes no time to dump his current girlfriend right in front of Haru. He then confesses his love to Haru. But then he says that what ever kind of guy she likes is the one he will turn into. Instead of confessing her feelings to him, she takes him up on the challenge, telling him that she likes guys that are the total opposite of him.

Contains one shot "Kamen no Pianist."
