## Sinopse

Hachiouji Tarou is usual 2nd-year high school student. Since his father died, leaving him as a head of family, he's been saving his brother out of trouble. One night, when he came back home, his mother's head was rolling on the floor, and an evil spirit was grabbing his brother. Instead of helping him, he hesitated and stood frozen. Now Tarou is on quest to find his brother and exterminate evil spirits.
