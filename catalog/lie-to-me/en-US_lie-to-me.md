## Sinopse

Lie to Me
Kim Hyunjin moved into the condo that Lee Gangjae left quite abruptly, so she tracks him down in order to make him pay the maintenance bills and the other assorted fees he left her with. Gangjae, being quite a smug individual, refuses to pay her, and while Hyunjin is driving after him, he gets into a car accident. When Gangjae awakens with amnesia, Hyunjin decides to trick him into thinking she is his girlfriend in order to pay him back for his refusal to pay her the money he owes. But will her game turn into something more, and what will happen when Gangjae's memories return?

French Kiss
While eating at a cafe one day, Yoonha accepts a dare to kiss someone in the restaurant. After the kiss, she runs away, leaving the unlucky recipient, Joonsuh, livid and vowing vengeance on Yoonha for stealing his first kiss. When he finally catches up to her, he makes Yoonha cater to his whims, but the more time he spends with her, the more he begins to like her.

Conspiring With the Enemy
A group date can be a great place to meet people, but things don't go very well for the delinquent Hyun Myunghae, who ends up arguing with Kim Jangchul. A few days later, she learns that her class will be getting a new teacher, who turns out to be none other than Jangchul.
