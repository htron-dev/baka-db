Gangjae, being quite a smug individual, refuses to pay her, and while Hyunjin is driving after him, he gets into a car accident. When Gangjae awakens with amnesia, Hyunjin decides to trick him into thinking she is his girlfriend in order to pay him back for his refusal to pay her the money he owes. But will her game turn into something more, and what will happen when Gangjae's memories return?\n\nFrench Kiss\nWhile eating at a cafe one day, Yoonha accepts a dare to kiss someone in the restaurant. After the kiss, she runs away, leaving the unlucky recipient, Joonsuh, livid and vowing vengeance on Yoonha for stealing his first kiss.

A few days later, she learns that her class will be getting a new teacher, who turns out to be none other than Jangchul.
