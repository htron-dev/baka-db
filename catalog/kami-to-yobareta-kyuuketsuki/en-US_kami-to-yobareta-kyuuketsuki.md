## Sinopse

In a certain town, there are humans and various Japanese demons and spirits living near one another. There's also another unusual supernatural creature, Vlad the vampire. He has made this land his home, and has become a kind of god there, living in a shrine a bit apart from the city. Though he is a vampire, he does his best to protect the humans from other dangerous spirits. Sometimes, though, sad things happen that he is unable to prevent.
