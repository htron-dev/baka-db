He has made this land his home, and has become a kind of god there, living in a shrine a bit apart from the city. Though he is a vampire, he does his best to protect the humans from other dangerous spirits. Sometimes, though, sad things happen that he is unable to prevent.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
