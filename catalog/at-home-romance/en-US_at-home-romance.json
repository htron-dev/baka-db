    "sinopse": "Meet the Morimura family where Ryutaro, the son, has a mother complex with the mother, Akemi, and the older sister, Akiko, has a brother complex with Ryutaro. Imagine a house where Akiko sneaks into bed naked while Ryutaro is still asleep or middle schooler Ryutaro still snuggling next to his mom. The kid’s classmates are just as bad as them, having severe brother and sister complexes.\n\n(Source: MU)",
