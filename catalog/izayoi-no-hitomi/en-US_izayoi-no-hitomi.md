## Sinopse

Naoki is a high school student who's lived quite normally for 16 years; but recently, disturbing visions of unbelievable creatures has begun to plague his peaceful, if slightly lonely, life.

Izayoi Takuma is a bespectacled, calm and mysterious transfer student, who immediately takes to filling Naoki in on the strange occurrences.
"I'm a sorcerer, your ally. We must fight the Grotesques, but I require your assistance to do so."

Izayoi knows of Naoki's past, and implies that they both possess great power which can only be properly unleashed if they work together. Naoki is confused, remembers nothing, and asks only to be able to return to his ordinary lifestyle.
