We must fight the Grotesques, but I require your assistance to do so.\"\n\nIzayoi knows of Naoki's past, and implies that they both possess great power which can only be properly unleashed if they work together. Naoki is confused, remembers nothing, and asks only to be able to return to his ordinary lifestyle.\n\n(Source: MU)",
