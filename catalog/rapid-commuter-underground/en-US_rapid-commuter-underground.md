## Sinopse

Zajirou is a salaryman who draws manga during his daily four-hour round-trip commuteâ€”a perfectly appropriate activity on a subway that shuttles between fantasy and reality. Today he continues to ride that real/surreal subway, pen in hand, depicting a mysterious underground world where pens take the form of pantographs and elephants amble aboard the train.
