## Sinopse

Spin-off of Saraiya Goyou featuring Souji the Saint and Benzou the Demon as young men.

Benzo and Souji witnessed the death of Tatsugoro, leader of the Akame Gang. Tatsugoro's last words to them were "I'm leaving you two in charge," but it was Jinzaburo, the former leader's friend, who was chosen instead. Displeased with Tatsugoro's wife's decision, the two left the gang. They then set off on an aimless journey, vowing to accomplish something big.
