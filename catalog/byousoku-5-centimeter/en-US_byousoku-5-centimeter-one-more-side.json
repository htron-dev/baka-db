    "sinopse": "A contemporary classic, 5 Centimeters per Second won animator Makoto Shinkai international renown as a rare talent. Indeed, he just might be one of the most powerful bards of romantic longing and thwarted love working today in any medium. This official novelization narrates from the other side—for instance, from the point-of-view of the girl rather than the boy in the legendary first segment, “Cherry Blossoms”—to tell a story that is both deeply engaging for first-timers and astonishingly fresh for fans of the film.\n\n(Source: Vertical Inc.)",
