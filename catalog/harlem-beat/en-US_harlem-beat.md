## Sinopse

Some athletes dream of the bling-bling, others dream of the women. But real hoop dreams reflect the desire to be the best. The dream of being able to take the rock, drive the lane, and take it to the hole. That's Nate Torres, branded as the team benchwarmer, just trying to get that shot at high school fame and glory. When he blows his chance to try and make his high school team, he takes his dream to the only place he has left ... the streets.

Away from the spotlight and glory of organized basketball, Nate Torres discovers himself on a back alley half-court.
