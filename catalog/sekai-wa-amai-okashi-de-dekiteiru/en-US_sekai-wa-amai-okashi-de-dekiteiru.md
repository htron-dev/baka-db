## Sinopse

Touma returns home from Paris where he was studying to be a patissier when his father, an artisan making traditional confectionary, collapses. His father is all right, but the relationship between father and son is awkward. Then Touma's fellow patissier apprentice and sex friend, Solomon, comes chasing after Touma. Solomon is impressed by the Japanese confectionary made by Touma's father and claims that he wants to become his apprentice!
