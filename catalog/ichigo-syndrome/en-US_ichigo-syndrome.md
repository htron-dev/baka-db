## Sinopse

Itsuki Furuse, a student in her second year of high school. Touma Hino, a mathematics teacher at Itsuki's school. The two live in the same neighbourhood, and have been dating for a half a year, although this innocent couple have yet to even kiss. Touma always responds to Itsuki's conveyance of love either in a cool and calm manner, and sometimes very sweetly. Every day, Itsuki's flirting brings cuteness and wholesomeness.
