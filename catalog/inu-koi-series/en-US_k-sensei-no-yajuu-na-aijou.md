## Sinopse

Popular erotica writer Kaji "K" sensei's glamorous appearance is only rivaled by the fantastic rumors surrounding him. Like how one of his best selling novels was based on a relationship with a high school student... or how 2 of his model sex friends got into a cat-fight in the middle of a highway... or how he has threesomes during his nocturnal writing sessions! At least these are the things that go through editor Kobayakawa's head when he sees his celebrity charge, that and the one where K sensei sent three editors to the hospital?! Yet, while taking photos for a magazine interview and watching K sensei work with such professional focus Kobayakawa realizes that the outrageous rumors may be just that. That is until Kaji pushes him down on the sofa to "reward" him. Thus begins the hunt of the herbivore editor and his carnivore author.
