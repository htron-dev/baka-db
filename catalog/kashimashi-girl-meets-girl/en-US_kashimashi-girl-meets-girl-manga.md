## Sinopse

Following an afternoon of alien encounters, death, and resurrection, Hazumu Osaragi wakes up to find that he is now a girl. While this is shocking to Hazumu, her friends couldn't be happier! This is especially true for Yasuna Kamiizumi, who has a chronic condition that causes all males to blend together in her eyes. Hazumu has always been the one exception to this condition, to Yasuna's confusion, so she is elated at Hazumu's transformation. However, Hazumu's childhood friend Tomari Kurusu still harbors the romantic feelings she had for Hazumu ever since they were younger. Hazumu now has to choose between two girls competing over her. She feels flattered, but she'd rather just choose them both!
