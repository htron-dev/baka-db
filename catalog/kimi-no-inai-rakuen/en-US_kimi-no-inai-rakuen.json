    "sinopse": "When Tomoe's father, a nature-loving photographer, tragically dies in an accident, she and her mother must learn to cope with living life without him. Her only refuge comes in the form of her father's only pupil, Kazuya, but she is unable to see him often because of his busy schedule. Love, joy, pain, and suffering. A young girl's heart is simply bursting with emotions, emotions that she wishes she can share with a special someone.\n\n(Source: Stiletto Heels)",
