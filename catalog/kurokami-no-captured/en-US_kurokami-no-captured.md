## Sinopse

Dark Hair Captured is an incredibly underrated and imaginative fantasy story about a young Earthling named Captured and his adventures in a distant universe where he isn't really wanted. When he was really young, he was tormented by the other kids, and when he came across a special ring, he acquired the power of the Spect'master which gave him great power and the ability to change his arm into a weapon. Together with his dad Manji and a willowy girl named Camel whom they met across the way, they hunt for treasure and work toward helping Manji get back to his homeland.
