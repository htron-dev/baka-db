## Sinopse

Five sexy teachers, and a boy with lots to learn! Susumu Arisaka has just turned 18, and that means he can move out of the orphanage and into his childhood home. He's looking forward to finally living on his own, but five of his high school teachers have gotten there first. They're looking forward to helping him around the house—and teaching him a thing or two about life in the process. It's not at all what Susumu expected, and he's not sure if the situation's awful, or pretty darn great!
