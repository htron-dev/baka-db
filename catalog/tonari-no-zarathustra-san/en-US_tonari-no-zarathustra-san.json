    "sinopse": "This year's 10th issue of Shueisha's Business Jump magazine announced on Wednesday that Hideki Ohwada is launching a new comedy manga series called Tonari no Zarathustra-san (My Neighbor Zarathustra) in the next issue on May 2. In his new gag comedy series, Ohwada will explore the world of Friedrich Nietzsche, the great German existential philosopher who wrote the novel Thus Spoke Zarathustra.\n\nOhwada is known for earlier unconventional comedy manga such as the no-holds-barred mahjong diplomacy manga Mudazumo Naki Kaikaku: The Legend of Koizumi, the dark magical-girl comedy Great Magical Gap (Dai Mahō Tōge) and the parody title Kidō Senshi Gundam-san.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
