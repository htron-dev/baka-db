## Sinopse

Karen is head over heels in love with her childhood friend, the brusque and fierce-looking Mii-kun. Day after day, she makes amorous advances toward him in hopes of making him her future husband. But when it's just the two of them, she can't help but feel a little nervous...? She's a headstrong queen in front of everyone else, but when faced with the boy she likes, she can't help but turn back into a blushing schoolgirl?! A youthful love comedy that will make your heart pound!
