## Sinopse

Inugami is a high school student suffering from his hypersensitive nose. Allergic to the stinks of the world, there's no place in the world for him to feel safe and composed except his house which his grandfather keeps clean. One day, he got caught up in an accident that will disturb his not-so-quiet life, and now he has to kiss to survive?!
