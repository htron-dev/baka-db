    "sinopse": "Vowing never to separate from his childhood friend Hisame, Itsuki travels on Tokaido with him in search of new adventures. Exterminating youkai along the way, they depend on each other to finish the job. As dark and mischievous as he is, Itsuki seems to have a one-sided love for Hisame; however, Hisame's naive nature stops him from ever taking Itsuki seriously. Will Itsuki's attempts prevail, or will they be in vain?\n\n(Source: Bliss)",
