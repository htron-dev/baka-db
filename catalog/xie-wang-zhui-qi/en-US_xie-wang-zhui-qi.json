    "sinopse": "She, a renowned assassin of the 21st century, actually crossed over to become Su Manor’s most useless good-for-nothing Fourth Miss.\n\nHe, Jin Empire’s imperial highness, was an emotionless overbearing demonic tyrant with unrivaled talent.\n\nEveryone knew that she was idiotic and good-for-nothing and bullied her as they pleased. But only he, the overbearing tyrant with the discerning eye, wouldn’t let go of her even if his life depended on it.\n\nFor the time being, let’s just see how the stubborn versus stubborn clash and play out in this good show of the chaser and the chased.\n\n(Source: Official Webnovel)",
