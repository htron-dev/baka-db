    "sinopse": "Twenty-year-old Yutaka Hanagasaki enjoys working as a gardener at Fuegaoka Theme Park. As a flower enthusiast, he prefers to surround himself with flowers rather than people. The only person he pays attention to is Karin Kawai, the person behind Merun-chan—the popular mascot of Fuegaoka Theme Park. To him, Karin is as beautiful as the flowers he takes care of, and admiring her from afar is usually all that is needed to brighten his day at work.\n\nHowever, on one rainy day, Yutaka finally musters up the courage to approach Karin. As his actions lead to an unexpected turn of events, the relationship between them begins to blossom.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
