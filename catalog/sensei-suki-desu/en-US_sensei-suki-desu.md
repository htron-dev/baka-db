## Sinopse

A bachelor for the past 11 years, Higuchi Yuuki is a male teacher in an all-girls school. He keeps wondering how to bridge the gap between himself and his students when he's suddenly confessed to by Ichikawa, one of his students.

Although Higuchi rejects her, Ichikawa does all she can to get her teacher to turn her way—even if it means making him grope her or holding his hand in class. When Higuchi can't understand why she'd like an unimpressive and inexperienced guy like him, she kisses him!

Will Higuchi be able to handle the feelings of his beautiful student, especially when she's not the only one to have fallen for him?
