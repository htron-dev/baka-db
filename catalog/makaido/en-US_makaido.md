Yonezo Yonekura is a young student, who is just starting to mature and notice his old childhood friend Tomoyo.

One day when walking home, a strange old man warns Yonezo not to touch a demonic book that he will come across on his way home from school, but when Yonezo sees the book, he is too curious and picks it up anyways...
