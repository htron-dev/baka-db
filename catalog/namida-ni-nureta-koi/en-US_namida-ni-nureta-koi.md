## Sinopse

Contains Five One-shots:

1. Yoake Mae (Before Daybreak)
   Iori is the daughter of a wealthy family who has lived a caged-in existence. She has lived her life following the path set down by her parents, and now she is about to be married off to a man she doesn't love. She runs away and stumbles upon the late-night food stand run by Akira. His kindness and warmth opens her mind to a world she didn't know existed--but when his tragic past threatens to destroy the pure love that has begun to blossom, she must choose between the life she has always known and a love she didn't know was possible.
