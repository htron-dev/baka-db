    "sinopse": "Kurusu Tetsunari is facing the biggest crisis of his life. He's the lead guitarist and vocalist of a band that's trying to make its pro debut, but the producer insists that Clover needs a new vocalist. Kurusu is stubborn and doesn't want an outsider singing the songs he wrote. To make things worse, the producer recommends a 16 year old boy named Minato Shingo that gets nervous in front of crowds. Will the day come when Kurusu accepts Minato as Clover's new vocalist? What will happen when Minato takes the mike?\n\n(Source: shinkeikaku)",
