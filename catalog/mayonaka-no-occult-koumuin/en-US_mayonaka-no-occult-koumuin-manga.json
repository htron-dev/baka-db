    "sinopse": "Arata Miyako is a new government worker assigned to the Shinjuku Ward Office's \"Nighttime Regional Relations\" department. Each of Tokyo's 23 wards has one such department, which were established to solve paranormal and occult-related events. Arata can understand non-human speech that no one else understands, and he encounters a youkai at Shinjuku Gyoen park that calls him Abe no Seimei — the name of a historical Japanese occultist and diviner.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
