Each of Tokyo's 23 wards has one such department, established to mitigate paranormal and occult-related events. Arata's special skill is the understanding of non-human speech, and the story begins with him encountering a youkai at Shinjuku Imperial Gardens who refers to him as the legendary Heian-era exorcist, Abe no Seimei.\n\n(Source: Mayonaka No Occult Wikia)",
