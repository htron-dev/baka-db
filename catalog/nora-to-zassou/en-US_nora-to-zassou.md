## Sinopse

Following the death of his daughter, Assistant Inspector Hajime Yamada has lost hope in everything, and jobs like closing under-aged prostitution rings don't exactly help matters. But there he meets a girl who looks alarmingly like his late daughter. Her name is Shiori Umino, a runaway girl who's desperate enough to sell herself to escape her house but won't tell anyone why.
