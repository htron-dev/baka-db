## Sinopse

Satomi Ooguma has never been interested in anyone romantically; however, this changes when she meets fellow classmate Mizuki Kanda. Although Kanda is a girl, Ooguma mistakes her for a boy and finds herself developing romantic feelings for her.

When one of Ooguma's friends asks her to find some boys to help for an event, Ooguma turns to Kanda for assistance. Though reluctant, Kanda teasingly agrees to help her on the condition that they go on a date. However, much to her surprise, Ooguma eagerly accepts this proposal. What will happen when Ooguma finally realizes that Kanda is a girl?

Ikemen Girl to Hakoiri Musume follows the two girls as they explore the complexities of their relationship and what it truly means to love someone.
