    "sinopse": "In a society where money is king, the young men known as \"flowers\" hold a special role. In exchange for the financial support of those who have the means to patronize them, they serve their flower masters as symbols of taste, status, and wealth. Bought and sold at the whim of their masters, theirs is a precarious existence - save for the few who are lucky enough to have masters who can see the person behind the flower.\n\n(Source: Storm in Heaven)",
