    "sinopse": "Everyone has a set of principles that they live by. Whether this means to always say thank you or to never say never, everyone has at least one. Yamashiro has a set of thirteen principles he tries to adhere to. Among them is a rule to make every one night stand just that: a one night stand. But what happens if those principles are broken?\n\n(Source: Exiled Rebels Scans)",
