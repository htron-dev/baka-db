    "sinopse": "Kengo is depressed after injuring his arm during baseball practice. He meets an unsociable student in the music room. The next day, after realizing that the student was his classmate, Yoshioka, who has never shown up for class, he visits the music room again. Despite Yoshioka's evasiveness, Kengo's persistence leads to the discovery that Yoshioka was held back one year due to a case of bullying. This is a story that depicts a tale of love between two wounded boys.\n\n(Source: Hoshikuzuu Scans)",
