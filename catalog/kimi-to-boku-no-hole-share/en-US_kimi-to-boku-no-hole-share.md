## Sinopse

Madoka Hayashi's life hasn't turned out the way he had hoped, with his hobby of needle felting being his only respite from the stress of being overworked at an unfulfilling office job. However, everything changes when Tamaki, a woman who lives in the room next door, accidentally punches a hole in their wall.

[Written by Denji]
