## Sinopse

When Fukase notices shy Niina looking his way, he decides to have a little fun with his underclassman. Harboring secret feelings for him, Niina can’t help but give in to Fukase’s advances, but doesn’t know what to make of the mixed signals he’s getting. Between Fukase’s steamy embrace and icy attitude, will Niina ever have the confidence to confess his real feelings? And when it seems that Fukase isn’t the only one interested in Niina, will he be able to maintain his uncaring facade, or will he have to admit that he’s been drawn in by Niina’s gaze?
