## Sinopse

Han Sae Bik, a beautiful singing voice, wishes to be a famous singer in Southern Korea. She moved to Seoul along with her family in order to fulfill her dream. However, she failed in all 48 singing auditions not because of her talent but her unconventional style.

Her family, especially her grandfather, is strongly opposed her dream, banning her from becoming a singer because of the thought that it's not a proper job for a person born into a traditional house. Once, when falling asleep in a hairdresser's, she's got her haircut just like a handsome boy . She participated in a singing contest in order to earn money for a wig. She has been mistaken to be a boy and win the contest. An entertainment agency noticed her and asked her to be in a boy band with other 4 members. The story now begins.
