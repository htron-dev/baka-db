## Sinopse

A new kid moves to town for a short stay with his father. He's really good at playing the ocarina but difficult to befriend. A bird likes to listen to his music and when a storm arrives they all help the bird by placing it and its nest into a bird house; this helps them all form an everlasting friendship as he moves once again.
