    "sinopse": "The latest otome game is all the rage recently, so a regular university student decides to see for herself if its fame is well-deserved. She clears the normal mode in no time and finds herself pitying the villainess, Penelope Eckhart. Penelope is a fake―a replacement for the duke's missing daughter, the protagonist of the game.\n\nInitially confident about clearing the hard mode as well, the woman is shocked by the sheer leap in the level of difficulty, eventually passing out from exhaustion. However, when she wakes up, she no longer recognizes her surroundings, for she has been reincarnated into the body of the villainess!\n\nIn a world where everyone seems to be out for her blood, Penelope must make wise decisions that keep her away from the death route. A tyrant prince, a suspicious magician, a nobleman from a fallen nation, or one of her nasty adoptive brothers―whose affections will she win?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
