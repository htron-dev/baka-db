## Sinopse

"Journey Back to the Jurassic...and sneak a peek at your favorite dinosaurs as you've never seen them! Dinosaur Hour! is a collection of comics about dinos who are bullies and ghost-believers, pranksters and bungling little brothers. With such goofy antics, it's no wonder these guys went extinct!"
