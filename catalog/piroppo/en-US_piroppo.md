## Sinopse

Piroppo is a short series commisioned by Sony for the promotion of their robot dog Aibo. Apparently 54 slots of about 20 seconds each were made, but the dvd release totals 23 named episodes.

Created by ISHII Katsuhito, director of Trava Fist Planet and several of the Grasshoppa live action projects, this is a highly original project despite the limited budget.
