## Sinopse

A boy and a girl work on a farm. The boy takes a break to play the violin which the girl and farm animals love to hear. The farm owner was mean and smashed the boy's violin. In his sad state he encounters a witch disguised as a donkey and offers her his payment of the day, stale bread, as that is the only food he had. The witch is grateful and grants the boy one wish.
