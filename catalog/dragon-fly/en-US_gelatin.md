## Sinopse

The sales pitch is "Top notch All Original Bishojo Comic" and on the back cover of the book "The new Cute, Sexy, Cool, Impulsive, Sensual, All original works comic magazine" is printed. The series seems to put emphasis on "Moe" of bishojo characters and its scenarios and artworks. (Source: Akiba Souken).

"GELATIN" is the new quarterly manga anthology from Wani, publishers of the Robot anthology to which it is the spiritual successor (some series from Robot also continue into Gelatin). Like robot the vast majority of the stories are in full colour.
