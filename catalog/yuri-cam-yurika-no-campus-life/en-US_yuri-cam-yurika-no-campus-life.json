    "sinopse": "Yurika attends a girls-only college with a long tradition of lesbian love, and according to rumors, she's been with over half of the 10,000 girls who attend the school! This rumor is mortifying to Yurika, and seriously damages her chances of ever getting a boyfriend. The truth is, for some reason, she's just completely irresistible to women, even women who claim to be straight. One day, Yurika gets a call from her Dad, letting her know that his company is bankrupt. He suggests that she get by on her charms, since he can no longer help her with money. Is it time for Yurika to actually start taking advantage of her unwanted persona as a masterful lesbian lover?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
