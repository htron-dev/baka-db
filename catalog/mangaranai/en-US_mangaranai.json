    "sinopse": "Welcome to Otokita Manor, a haven for several manga artists! Its residents include Hana Fujimori, an 18-year-old up-and-coming manga artist who spends her limitless energy on everything except actually making manga; Kanoko Imamura, Hana's roommate of the same age who supports her but wishes she was more responsible; Moe Kitayama, an aggressive and easily frightened manga artist of poor skill; and Tamaki Nishikawa, a relatively older and more experienced artist who advises Hana while also occasionally joining in her tomfoolery.\n\nMangaranai. follows the daily life of these four girls—parties and hijinks included. But amidst the fun, will Hana ever start making manga?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
