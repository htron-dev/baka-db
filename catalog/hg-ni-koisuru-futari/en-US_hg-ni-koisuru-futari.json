    "sinopse": "Sixteen years ago, Sayaka Kanzaki witnessed the Strike Gundam for the first time during the premiere of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. Its magnificent figure as it arose from a sea of flames etched a lifelong passion for the franchise within her heart. However, as a 30-year-old office lady self-conscious about her public image, Kanzaki has kept this love hidden from her coworkers.\n\nOne day, Kanzaki meets Sora Takamiya, a 16-year-old high school student who also loves the Gundam franchise, especially Gundam Plastic Models. Sora's passion for creating these \"Gunpla\" models reminds Kanzaki of her own childhood as a young Gundam-loving girl. Guided by Sora, Kanzaki makes her first foray into the world of Gunpla building, and with it, reignites her love for Gundam.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
