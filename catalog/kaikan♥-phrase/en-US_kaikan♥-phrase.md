## Sinopse

Aine never wanted to be a writer; she just created some erotic song lyrics for the sake of entering a contest. When she bumps into a man she doesn't know and loses the lyrics, she thinks she'll never see them again, but she thought wrong! He turns out to be Sakuya, a famous rock vocalist known for his sexy persona and lyrics. When he invites Aine to be his new lyricist, she finds herself quickly sucked into the harsh world of showbiz... and the even harsher world of falling in love with a guy that millions of girls love just as much!
