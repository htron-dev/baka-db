    "sinopse": "Garden is a collection of Furuya Usamaru's \"indie\" shorts that were published in Comic Cue, Manga Erotics and GARO. The title is obviously a reference to Hieronymus Bosch's famous triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights, with the first story being a homage to said painting. The other stories range from absurd comedies to fantasy and horror. It's a very eclectic mixture, but make no mistake: artistically, Garden might just be Furuya's most accomplished work after Marie no Kanaderu Ongaku.\n\n(Source: Kotonoha)\n\n1.
