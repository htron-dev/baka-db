## Sinopse

When Frank tries to enlist Pupshaw and Pushpaw to help him dig up a repulsive plant that is marring the beauty of The Unifactor, the fun-loving tankheads vote with their paws and embark instead upon a spree of bullying mayhem. They are observed at this mean-spirited play by Little Skook, a celestial entity who makes a transdimensional journey to join them. Things quickly go awry and Pupshaw and Pushpaw find themselves in a terrifying world of flying, shrieking demons and bulbous-faced monsters.

While drawn by a western artist, and based on a series previously released in the US, this book has only been released in Japan, for a japanese audience.
