## Sinopse

Michelle is a romantic daydreamer and hardcore book collector. Maggie is a soft-spoken bookworm who always gets mistaken for a boy. Anita is a tomboy who doesn't have time for reading. Together, they're the Paper Sisters, three very different siblings united by a strange powerâ€”the ability to control paper in any way they desire! And from their Hong Kong detective agency, they solve any and all cases involving books!
