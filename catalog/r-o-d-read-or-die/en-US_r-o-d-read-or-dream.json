Anita is a tomboy who doesn't have time for reading. Together, they're the Paper Sisters, three very different siblings united by a strange powerâ€”the ability to control paper in any way they desire! And from their Hong Kong detective agency, they solve any and all cases involving books!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
