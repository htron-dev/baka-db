## Sinopse

Odaiba, Tokyo, a skyscraper devoid of human life. Woo had come from Hong Kong, bringing with him a rare book entitled "The Black Book of Fairy Tales." His counterpart was a blond Englishman. However, next to him was a bespectacled young Eurasian woman, whom he introduced as a consultant. To check her for weapons, Woo opened the front of the woman's coat and was promptly struck speechless. The inside of the coat bristled with pockets, which were overflowing with novels, magazines, newspapers, and God knows what else!
