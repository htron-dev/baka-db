## Sinopse

The new manga is a side story that is much darker than the Read or Die stories that came before it. It is set in a world where the death of books has been declared after the last printing press shuts down. However, there are bibliophiles who have rejected this era and have established a city state of their own called "Bibliopolis." The heroine is named Yomiko, but with different kanji (読魅子) in her name and a darker side.
