## Sinopse

No matter what age it is, bullying will never disappear. The overweight, middle school student, Haruyuki, was one such kid. The only time he could relax completely, was when he would play a squash game on the local network the school had set up. He loved playing this simple game as he can forget painful times while immersed in it.

It was fall. He was passing his time like this until one day, he had an encounter with the school's most beautiful, refined girl, "Snow Black," which changed his life abruptly. Introduced to the software she transmitted, Haruyuki learned about "Accel World." A program that enhances one's mind capabilities, with certain side-effects.

It was the moment the guy on the lowest rung at school became "Burst Linker," protecting the Princess as her knight.
