## Sinopse

Yuna Mogami, the daughter of a legendary hotel concierge, starts working as a care-worker at a nursing home for the elderly—which seems like a nightmare at first. People living out their final years must confront all sorts of personal and family issues—Yuna is under heavy pressure to provide the ultimate service: "Attending people on their deathbeds" and "Making sure their final moments are happy ones." Can she deliver her imperial hospitality, for the sake of the people in need——?!
