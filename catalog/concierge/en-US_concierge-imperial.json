People living out their final years must confront all sorts of personal and family issues—Yuna is under heavy pressure to provide the ultimate service: \"Attending people on their deathbeds\" and \"Making sure their final moments are happy ones.\" Can she deliver her imperial hospitality, for the sake of the people in need——?!\n\n(Source: Silent Manga Audition)",
