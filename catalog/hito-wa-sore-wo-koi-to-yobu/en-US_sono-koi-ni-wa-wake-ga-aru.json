    "sinopse": "Aoi, a first year student in all-boys high school, is a violent but beautiful boy. Viewing his good looks as a burden, he ruthlessly rejects every guy that approaches him. Until one day, Aoi notices Azuma, who’s been \"observing\" him quietly from the sidelines. To his surprise, Azuma’s attitude actually makes him feel safe, and he slowly fell in love?!\n\n(Source: MU)",
