## Sinopse

Shizuka grew up among wood works, tools and chisel. Her family has owned a carpentry business for two generations now, started by her grandfather, and now her dad. She's supposed to be the 3rd generation. Her grandfather wants her to carry on his business, but her father wants her to continue studying in a college and work in a corporate office. Shizuka, however, doesn't mind the idea of being a carpenter even though most carpenters are male.
