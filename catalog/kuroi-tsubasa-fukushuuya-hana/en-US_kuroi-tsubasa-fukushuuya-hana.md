## Sinopse

"If someone sins, someday they will pay for it. Retribution will be received." Plain and unassuming high school student Sannomiya Hana runs the 'Revenge Shop." As a child, her entire family was slaughtered while Hana alone survived. But the people trying to escape their hatred for the criminal suffer more. So Hana saves people wounded by the chains of hatred formed from bullying, betrayal, etc, and splendidly metes out retribution for the client! Yet for Hana herself, what can cut apart these chains of hatred...!?
