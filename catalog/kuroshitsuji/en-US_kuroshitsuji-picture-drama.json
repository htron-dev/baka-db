    "sinopse": "It is almost Valentine's Day, and grim reaper Grell Sutcliff finally receives the opportunity to become the heroine of her very own harem battle. Whilst making chocolates for the demonic butler Sebastian Michaelis, Grell's preparations are interrupted by a whole host of handsome men smashing through the window.\n\nFirst to appear is fellow reaper William T. Spears, who brings nothing but harsh reprimands. Next, however, the man of the hour appears—Sebastian Michaelis. The room begins to fill up even more, with Grell's unconventional harem expanding to include a pair of Phantomhive servants; the English branch manager of a Chinese trading company, Lau; the promiscuous Viscount Druitt; the Queen's butler, Ash Landers; and even the royal master-servant pair, Prince Soma and Agni. And when The Undertaker appears as \"The Valentine's Fairy,\" this chaotic gathering becomes a lot more romantic.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
