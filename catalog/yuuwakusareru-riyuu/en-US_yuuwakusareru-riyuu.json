    "sinopse": "He demanded an heir!\n\nAlessandro Di Livio is fiercely protective of his family, and he's determined to keep gold-digging Sam Maguire away from his sister's husband...even if it means seducing her himself! Sam is no femme fatale—in fact she's a virgin! But under Alessandro's expert touch she succumbs to one night in his arms. And when passion leads to pregnancy, Sam knows that Alessandro will do whatever it takes to have her as his wife and their baby as his heir!\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
