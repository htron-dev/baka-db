    "sinopse": "From an early age, Kiara has been plagued with dreams of another world—dreams in which a girl she doesn't recognize plays a strategy RPG called \"Farzia: Kingdom at War.\" Farzia is, in fact, the same kingdom where Kiara currently lives. Oh, and one other thing: there's an enemy character who's also named Kiara, though her name is Kiara Credias. Naturally, as with any other RPG villain, this enemy is slain by the heroes.\n\nSo when her adoptive father, Count Patriciél, orders her to marry Viscount Credias, Kiara comes to a horrifying realization: perhaps those \"dreams\" were visions of things to come! She hatches a plan to get the hell out of Dodge and create a new future for herself—one where she STAYS ALIVE, thank you very much!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",
