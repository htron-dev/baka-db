    "sinopse": "The stage is Edo. The second son of a draper store, Tenji is a beautiful boy that is earnest and kind as Bodhisattva. Tenji, who loves pretty things—especially hairpins—accidentally meets his favorite hairpin artisan, Shunsuke, one day, and ends up being shown around his workplace. Elated, he even follows Shunsuke to his home, but Shunsuke mistook Tenji for a woman and assaulted him! Shunsuke is actually a sensual man who welcomes all comers but never concerns himself with those who leave! And when he realizes Tenji is a man!? A beautifully and bewitchingly composed Edo picture scroll of passion of two straight men!\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
