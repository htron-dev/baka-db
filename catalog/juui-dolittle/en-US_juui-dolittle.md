## Sinopse

Kenichi Tottori is a highly competent vet that has been nicknamed "Dolittle." He's very strict with pet owners and the money they owe him, but he really is a great vet. Often, he ends up not only helping the pet, but also the owner. The manga starts off when a young woman, Asuka Tajima, asks him to treat a racehorse, Asuka Mirai, who has a broken leg. She accepts the high cost of treating the horse, but is shocked by the level of suffering the horse will have to endure to in order to heal.
