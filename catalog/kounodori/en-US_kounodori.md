## Sinopse

Pregnancy is not a disease, so insurance does not apply. Obstetric treatments do not treat injuries or illnesses, so an obstetrician is not normally needed during the birth of a child. Still, obstetricians are needed because anything can go wrong during a pregnancy. A mysterious pianist at night, obstetrician Kounotori Sakura faces the many challenges and drama that come with giving birth to another human being.
