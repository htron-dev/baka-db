## Sinopse

Deep in the woods, a little girl named Ellen lives in a beautiful mansion surrounded by red roses. She wants for nothing, but she can never leave her home due to an illness that keeps her bedridden.

One day, a kind young girl named Viola finds her way to Ellen's mansion, and the two become fast friends. Viola begins spending as much time as she can with her new sickly friend, drawn to her because of a mix of pity and growing friendship. But Viola's kindness will soon prove to be her downfall, as Ellen is not what she seems...
