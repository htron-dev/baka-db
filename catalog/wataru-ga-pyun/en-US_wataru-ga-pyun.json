    "sinopse": "A transfer student from Okinawa comes to a small and normal middles school called Towadai. Wataru, the transfer student, was an exceptionally gifted athlete but was a problem child. His behaviour was the cause of him to transfer from school to school. He first participated in baseball practice for fun but was heavily recruited by the Towadai team but initially he refused to join. Until he fell in love with the team manager Seki Wakaba. The manga follows Wataru and the Towadai middle school through regional tournaments and then evnetually the national stage. The entire manga depicts one summer but lasted 20 years and has about 58 volumes. The author includes a lot of Okinawan words making it a very unique baseball manga.",
