## Sinopse

Kurt, prince of a faraway kingdom, leave home to find a way to heal his petrified goddess-mother. Battling numerous monsters, overcome challenges set forth by Medusa's apostles, helping other people, all seem so heavy for a ten years old boy. Never fear, he's not alone. His youngest aunt, a goddess from heaven, his girlfriend collected along the way, his-not-quite-adversary, not-quite-friend, mysterous dark apostle... and various others. All get drawn in from his charisma, his will and his purity.
