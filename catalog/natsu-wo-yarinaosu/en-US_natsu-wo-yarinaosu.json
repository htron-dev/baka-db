    "sinopse": "Under the scorching summer sun, the chirping of cicadas can be heard at a school building. A young girl is crouching down with her back turned to you. The girl notices you there, stands up, and starts talking to you. \"Ever since that summer, I've been waiting for you...\" The truth about \"that summer\" slowly becomes clear as she speaks. The person I wanted to see was the person I must not see... An original short work created for VR. The theme song, \"Having Summer Again,\" is by the three-piece band Kerakera (Universal Music Japan), which is quickly gaining popularity.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",
