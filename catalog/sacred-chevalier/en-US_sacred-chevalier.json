The women who gain this godly strength and good looks become Paladins and participate in battle, and the men support the Paladins as Chevaliers. In Lente village, Kite, the son of a blacksmith, is a boy with a very strong libido. Former Paladin Lilia identifies him as a Chevalier candidate and encourages him to join the Royal Academy in the capital to become a Royal Chevalier.\n\n(Source: Gentosha Comics, translated)",
