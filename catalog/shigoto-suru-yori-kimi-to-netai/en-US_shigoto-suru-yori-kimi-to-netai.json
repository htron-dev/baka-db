    "sinopse": "My colleagues call me the \"snow demon,\" and I don't blame them; I can be cold as ice, and I have impossibly high expectations of everyone. But, after sleeping with my coworker Youichi, my imagination's gotten so hot and steamy! In the office, I'm constantly getting excited at the thought of doing it with him unprotected...! He's so in love with me I can't get any work done, but I'm not complaining!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
