    "sinopse": "Romance novelist Rio's struggling to write a young adult erotic novel. From what her agent says, her writing \"has no sex appeal\"... After some careful deliberation, she begs Mr. Fujishima, a cute banker she just happened to meet, to let her interview him about his sexual encounters. Fujishima doesn't look happy... In fact, he never looks happy, and yet, he can't help indulging her and softening a little at her straightforward authenticity... Rio feels so grateful to Mr. Fujishima for agreeing to \"show\" her how to have sex!\n\n(source: Renta!)",
