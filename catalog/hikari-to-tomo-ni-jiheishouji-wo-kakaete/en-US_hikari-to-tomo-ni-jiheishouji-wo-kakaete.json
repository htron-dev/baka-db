    "sinopse": "Born during the sunrise—an auspicious beginning—the Azumas' newborn son is named Hikaru, which means \"light.\" But during one play date, his mother notices that her son is slightly different from the other children. In this alternately heartwarming and bittersweet tale, a young mother tries to cope with both the overwhelming discovery of her child's autism and the trials of raising him while keeping her family together. This is a story that resonates not only for those whose families have been affected by autism, but also for all past, present, and future parents.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 15: Thank You Sensei!, Haru no Manazashi",
