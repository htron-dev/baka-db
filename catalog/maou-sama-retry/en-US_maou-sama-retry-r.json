The adventure of the strongest demon lord is far from over.\n\nAt the lowest floor of the dungeon, the Demon Lord came face to face with a presence that appears to be the creator of this world.\nHis next destination is the demon territory where there's an ongoing rivalry between devils.\n\nA new, incredibly energetic and cheerful high school girl has joined the gang. Once again, our character's bustling personalities and their idiosyncrasies will clash with each other.\n\n(Source: Futabasha, translated)",
