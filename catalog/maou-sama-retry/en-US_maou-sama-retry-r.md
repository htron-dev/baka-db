## Sinopse

Entering a new series! The adventure of the strongest demon lord is far from over.

At the lowest floor of the dungeon, the Demon Lord came face to face with a presence that appears to be the creator of this world.
His next destination is the demon territory where there's an ongoing rivalry between devils.

A new, incredibly energetic and cheerful high school girl has joined the gang. Once again, our character's bustling personalities and their idiosyncrasies will clash with each other.
