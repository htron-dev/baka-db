    "sinopse": "Kamiyama Samatarou is a god. But he still is a newbie god who just inherited from the former god and father, Osamu. He looks as common just as a high-school student living in a 10-year-old house in Setagaya, but he really is a god. And the Archangel Tenko, is the one who supports Samatarou, ordinarily as a classmate, and at home also doing all the household duties of the Kamiyama family. The two are again listening to various people’s wishes, saving ones from their misfortune, and then wondering if what they did was a mistake. “It’s all because you’re telling ‘Tamatarou~, sabe dat little boy~’ to him!!” …Did they grow up after all or what. And so! He’s still a “Temporary License” god!! Sorry to have kept you waiting: the new Hyper-At-Home-Comedy of the gods, finally appears.\n\n(Source: Book intro)",
