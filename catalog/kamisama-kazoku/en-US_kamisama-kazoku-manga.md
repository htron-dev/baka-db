## Sinopse

Samataro has it all: a loving family, two adorable sisters, a great best friend and even a guardian angel. It's always clear sailing, never a cloud in the sky… but that's life when you're the son of a god! Poor Samataro is bored to tears, since his loving mother and father always use their powers to make everything easy for him... but can he make it on his own when he finally tells them to back off?
