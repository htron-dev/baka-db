## Sinopse

A dangerous adventure with a globe-trotting playboy?

Dylan Russell is an exceptionally good-looking playboy who has traveled around the world. Jessica's crush on him was the biggest mistake of her childhood! Jessica visits the cabin she owns with her brother and coincidentally reunites with the man she never wanted to see again. Dylan says that he had wanted to spend some time alone there and had asked her older brother, Justin, to lend him the keys to the cabin. Jessica tries to kick him out, thinking that he's just running from an angry girlfriend, but they get stuck in the cabin together due to a storm. Unfortunately, Dylan is just as handsome as he was in the past. Jessica feels her heart waver, but she won't let herself fall for him again!
