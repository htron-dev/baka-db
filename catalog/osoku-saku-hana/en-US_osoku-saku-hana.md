## Sinopse

"What's going on? I just don't get it. Ever since I met Hashimoto, my heart's been filled with emotions I've never felt before..."

Since meeting Hashimoto, whose personality is the complete opposite of his, which is flippant and cold to others, high school student, Makino, can no longer hide the changes within his heart.

(from M-U)
