## Sinopse

It's been a year since Toki lost his twin sister in an accident. Toki is still dealing with the pain, but while his parents are away on a trip, he must now also take care of his orphaned nephew, who hasn't spoken a word since losing both of his parents. While Toki struggles to raise a child, his friend's younger brother Chihiro, starts giving a helping hand. How will these three people become a temporary family?
