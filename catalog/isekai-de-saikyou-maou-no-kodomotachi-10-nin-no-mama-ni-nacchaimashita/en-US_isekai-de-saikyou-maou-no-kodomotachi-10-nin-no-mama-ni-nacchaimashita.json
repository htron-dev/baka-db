    "sinopse": "In the world of Abilfia, war rages between humans and demons. The hero Albert leads his army into Demon Lord Gran's territory, the kingdom of Zodia. In order to save the demon race and win the war, the demon army decides to summon an otherworldly priestess to their realm.\n\nHaving lost the last of her family, 16-year-old Akari wishes to be a mama just as good as her own was. As the thought crosses her mind, she is transported to Zodia to become a mother... the mother of Gran's children! Being the pure-hearted soul that she is, she tries to help her summoners—but the more she learns about her new fantastical home, the more she realizes how little she really knows.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
