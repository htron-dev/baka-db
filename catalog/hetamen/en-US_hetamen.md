## Sinopse

Satoko has had enough – she’s not going to be a slave to her family and friends anymore! Determined, she leaves her house and demands her friend set up a couple’s mixer for her. But she still can’t break her habit of wanting to help everyone around her! Maybe meeting the clumsy, disheveled genius scientist Shinguuji will change her mind…or will it be the handsome and respectful Kenji?
