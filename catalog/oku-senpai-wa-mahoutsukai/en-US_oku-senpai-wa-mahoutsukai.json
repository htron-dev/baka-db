    "sinopse": "\"From this day forth, you're my slave.\" Sen quit the athletics team due to an injury, so he has a lot of spare time... until one day after school, when he crosses paths with a mysterious pig. Sen chases after it, and finds sophomore Masamune Oku waiting for him. Masamune announces that he's \"descended from witches\" and suggests a deal with Sen. He says Sen has magical powers he releases involuntarily—if he gives Masamune those powers by becoming his slave, Masamune will grant him the ability to fly—Sen's childhood dream. Sen agrees to the contract, but then he's told the only way to give away his powers is through \"sexual acts\"...! What's more, when he tries kissing Masamune, he gets turned on—maybe because of the contract's side effects...? Sen wants to fly, but can he engage in sexual acts with a guy...!? A fluffy romantic comedy between a daydreaming high school boy and a self-proclaimed wizard boy with glasses!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
