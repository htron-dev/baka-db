## Sinopse

In this prequel to Mienai Hoshi, Imai, who belongs the baseball club, has feelings for his clumsy kouhai, Hikita. Hikita, whose face falls into a continuous scowl when he's nervous... That kind of Hikita is cute, nothing else to it.

"When you're this cute, I'm the one who has to be careful..."

Even while touching in this helpful senpai's heart of hearts, he wants to touch Hikita's naked body...?!
