Having no desires to become the Demon Lord, he sits around in the Demon Lord's castle as a random low rank guardian. One day, the Hero's party comes to attack and on a whim he knocks out the entire hero party. Healing up the Hero party and then preparing to send them back to town, he notices the female priest and falls in love at first sight!\n\n(Source: MU)",
