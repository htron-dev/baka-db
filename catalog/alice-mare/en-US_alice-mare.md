The novel follows an amnesiac young boy named Allen who was placed under the care of a man called Teacher who looks after four other children. One night, Allen investigates the rumor of a mysterious voice on the second floor and when he returns to his room, he finds a strange black cat who leads him into his closet and he winds up in an even stranger Dream. Now caught up in this World, he is forced to help the White Rabbit retrieve the four World Keys scattered throughout and hopefully find a way back home.
