## Sinopse

Coil is a man whose idea of "life" is his alter ego in an online world. A place where the hearts of people come together...and it is not a pretty place. The slender spiderweb that connects their souls within this endless world brings greater pain than reality itself. (Source: Mangascreener.com)
