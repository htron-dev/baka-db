    "sinopse": "Kugo, ace pilot of Galaxy Quest, detects an unidentified SOS signal during one of his training sessions. Tracing it back to its source, he ventures down to the mysterious Planet Zi and finds himself surrounded by a new metallic species - the Zoids! As if meeting theses \"living machines\" aren't strange enough, when Kugo later tries to rescue a wild Zoid from certain death, he discovers he is able to pilot it, even when he has no experience in handling one! Did the SOS signal reach Kugo by chance, or is it more than just coincidence?",
