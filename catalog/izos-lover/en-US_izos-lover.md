## Sinopse

Once upon a time, there was a courtesan who fell in love with an impoverished Noh-mask maker. However, when her lover rejected her, the courtesan threw herself from a bridge in despair. She left behind a note cursing him and his descendents. In current day one of that man’s decedents, Izou, discovers that the guardian mask at his temple has cracked and the ghost of the past has come back for her lover.
