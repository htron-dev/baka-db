Since then, nothing has gone well in Jouji's life, until 10 years later in 1989, his friend was ordered to kill him, and as he ran away he killed himself, ending his miserable life.\n\nBut when Jouji opened his eyes, he was in Shinjuku in 1979, at the fight with the university students that caused things to go wrong. Now with ten more years of memories and experience, Jouji repels the university students with spirit and wisdom. Now he swears to wear a gold emblem around town, and begins his life anew.\n\n(Source: Hokuto no Gun)",
