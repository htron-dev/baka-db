When he is about to be hit by a train, he is saved by Yamamoto who speaks with an Osaka dialect. After his encounter with Yamamoto, Takashi recovers his bright personality and gets better results at work. One day, Takashi sees Yamamoto boarding a bus to the cemetery with a serious expression.\n\n(Source: AsianWiki)",
