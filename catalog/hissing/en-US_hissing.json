    "sinopse": "Da-Ae, an aspiring comic artist, comes across Seon-Nam, a softie whose ultimate goal is simply to become a 'tough guy.' Seon-Nam is gradually attracted to Da-Ae, but it seems like the bond between them is turning out to be a curse. Da-Ae and Seon-Nam fall in love with each other, not knowing that they are connected by a complicated family history.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
