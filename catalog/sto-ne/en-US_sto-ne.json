    "sinopse": "In the not-too-distant future, our planet becomes a wasteland covered by sand -- the world is like a dry, lifeless stone. Civilization is without hope. Awesome and terrifying creatures scour the sand, searching for food and facing off against the few human survivors.\n\nZizi is a mysterious girl with the power to see through the sand sea. Her tribe has endured against the great sand whales, but the hunt has turned dry of late and things are looking bleak. In her hardscrabble search for survival, Zizi meets a pirate Sabu on the sand sea. The future of their peoples - and the success of their quest for something to believe in - just may depend on these two...\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
