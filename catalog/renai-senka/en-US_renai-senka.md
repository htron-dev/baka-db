## Sinopse

Nobuta Yabuta is a new teacher at Sakura Gakuen, a prestigious girls' high school. Unfortunately, he is also a gyno-phobe (afraid of women). Even more troublesome for our protagonist is that the class he is in charge of as home room teacher is a "love specialized course." Five of the girls in the class have one objective in order to graduate: to win a kiss from their homeroom teacher.
