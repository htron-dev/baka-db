## Sinopse

One day, a mysterious box arrived at Matsuda's door steps. The content of the box was none other than an android girl that insists that she's Matsuda's younger sister. Now, the purely otaku Matsuda has the privilege to live with a beautiful and submissive android sister that bows to his commands, or at least he wishes that were the case.
