## Sinopse

Another new series from JUMP SQ! By the end of the chapter, you'll understand where the title PAT-KEN comes from. This manga is about a boy named Hayabusa, who dreams of becoming a hero in the name of justice. Which is why he took up a part-time job acting as a costumed hero for a children's stage show. But, when the real villains, the Darkside Arms (DA), attack, the real heroes of the city, the Armored Guardians (AG) are called in. Will Hayabusa be allowed to join the Armored Guardiands and attain his dream of becoming a real hero? Many themes in the manga are borrowed from television sentai series, so fans of Power Rangers might enjoy this!
