## Sinopse

Tarou is a 31-year-old no-good writer who has never cooked his own food and been living an unhealthy life. One day, he meets an energetic greengrocer, Haruki, and they both ended up drinking at his house. Getting drunk, Tarou unconsciously says naughty things which makes Haruki lose his control. Although Tarou is supposed to be straight, he becomes loose after being fucked. After that, they keep a physical relationship but Haruki notices that Tarou has a masochistic side so he starts to attack Tarou sweetly and sadistically...?
