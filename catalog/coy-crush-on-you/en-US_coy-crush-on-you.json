    "sinopse": "Seung Hun is a handsome playboy who's never experienced true love. Woo Sun is a charming playgirl who wants to be loved for herself and not her beauty.\n\nJong Yi is the beautiful, mysteriously childlike and vacant boy who becomes the object of their affections. A complex love triangle evolves between these three, further complicated by the involvement of Jong Yi's unfailingly devoted childhood friend and first love, a girl named Yu Ri.\n\nThey're all soon to discover that love is a long, painful path...especially if the object of it is completely oblivious to your attentions!\n\n(Source: MU)",
