The nickname of the class is \"girls class.\" Even though she's treated as a VIP, associating with guys is strictly forbidden, so every day is very boring for her. One-sidedly in love with her childhood friend, Kousei, who also goes to the same school, with the help of a friend she recently made, Shuu, Rinko sets out on a conquest to reform the school!!\n\n(From: Aerandria Scans)",
