## Sinopse

Rinko is a girl who goes a class of all female students with fancy facilities, established from a former all boys school. The nickname of the class is "girls class." Even though she's treated as a VIP, associating with guys is strictly forbidden, so every day is very boring for her. One-sidedly in love with her childhood friend, Kousei, who also goes to the same school, with the help of a friend she recently made, Shuu, Rinko sets out on a conquest to reform the school!!
