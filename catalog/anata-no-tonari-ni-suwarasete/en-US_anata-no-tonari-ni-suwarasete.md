## Sinopse

When the chair he fell in love with at first sight was purchased by someone else, Azumi becomes terribly drunk one night and is nursed back to health by an unknown man... and wouldn't you know it, it's the person who owns the chair, Takamiya Shinjin. The adorable, puppy-like Azumi is charmed by the sexually attractive Shinjin, and Azumi's battle of love commences!
