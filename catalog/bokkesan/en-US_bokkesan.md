## Sinopse

Hinomiya is a quiet student who never says anything, but has a supernatural power. He saved Shijiro Sayu a number of years ago when she was falling, and since then she has considered him a friend. One day, an unnatural murder occurs, and a little girl escaping the killers runs into Hinomiya and Shijiro, with the supernatural villains not far behind.
