## Sinopse

Abel, a boy abandoned by his family because of the fear his unparalleled talent for magic evoked on them, was taken to an orphanage and taught magic by a former great magician.

Eventually, his ability far surpassed that of his teacher and after receiving an invitation from the magical society known as Chaos Raid he embarks on a journey with the fire hero, Maria and the water hero Daytona and later, the ash hero, Cain.

This is the story of Abel's childhood and adolescence before his reincarnation.
