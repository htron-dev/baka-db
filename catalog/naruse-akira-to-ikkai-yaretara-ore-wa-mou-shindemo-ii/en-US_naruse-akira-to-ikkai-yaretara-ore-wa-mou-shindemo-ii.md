## Sinopse

The small and timid Hotaru and popular good looking Akira have been childhood friends since long ago. However, Akira's popularity causes them to slowly drift apart. After witnessing a scene that he should not have, Hotaru comes to realize his feelings for his childhood friend. In their last year of high school, realizing that he may never cross paths with Akira again once they graduate and move to different universities, Hotaru takes his one last chance at a memory with Akira... by pushing him down and tying his hands with tape?!
