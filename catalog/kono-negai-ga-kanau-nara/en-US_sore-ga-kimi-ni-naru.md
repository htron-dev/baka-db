## Sinopse

A spin-off of Kono Negai ga Kanau nara, with You as the main character.

Amane, a 26-year-old woman, is still getting over the bad breakup she had with a girl named Yuki back when she was in high school. One day, she bumps into a high school girl who looks exactly like Yuki and bursts out in tears. This high school girl, who is named You, takes Amane out for lunch to try and help her feel better. As the two grow closer to one another, feelings begin to stir in both of their hearts, but will they be able to overcome the burden Yuki has placed upon Amane?
