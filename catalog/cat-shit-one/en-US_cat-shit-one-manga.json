    "sinopse": "Inside the jungles of Vietnam, a courageous Special Ops. Unit is fighting the most infamous war of decades pastâ€”the Vietnam War. This bold account follows the brave exploits of Sergeant \"Perky\" Perkins and his unit...of rabbits! Join Rats, Perky and Botaski as they fight against the cats of the Viet Cong. From the Tet Offensive to the My Canh bombing, watch these commando-style bunnies through an anthropomorphic lens as events unfold and violence erupts.\n\nOn-human cast of characters notwithstanding, this compelling and painstakingly-researched work places an emphasis on factualism in order to accurately portray the events of the Vietnam War. With a fresh perspective on one of history's greatest calamities, Apocalypse Meow is a daring new take on a conflict that won't soon be forgotten...especially after these young rabbits are done!\n\n(Source: Manga Sketchbook)",
