    "sinopse": "It was the night of December 24. High school student Riichi’s long-held feelings for Natsumi had been returned. Yet before his happiness could sink in, she lost her life right in front of him. Once he regained his senses, he had returned to two days prior... He learnt that the words \"I love you\" had become a trigger to rewind time. He attempted to avoid the confession from his beloved but she would always do so, and die once again.\n\n\"I love you, Riichi. I love you.\"\n\nTrapped in an endless Christmas Eve, will Riichi manage to overcome the recurring tragedy and seize his future?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
