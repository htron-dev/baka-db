    "sinopse": "Here is the unusual story of Sakura, a 21 year old mother raising her toddler daughter alone. She is a widow, her husband having drowned at sea while rescuing others. Sakura is having trouble making ends meet and raising her daughter by herself. Fortunately for her, things get interesting when she meets a new arrival- Go. Go is the brother of Sakura's husband. Sakura had never met him before, and his appearance is startling. He is a big, muscular guy with shoulder-length wavy hair. Not at all the same type as her late husband. Go has recently returned to Japan from America, where he worked as a Pro Wrestler. Now that he is back in Japan, he plans on continuing his unusual career. Sakura's daughter Momoko has a strong liking for Go, and soon enough the three of them are living together in an unusual, yet functional family. This is a cute, fun story!\n(from http://piffleprincess.com/sakai)",
