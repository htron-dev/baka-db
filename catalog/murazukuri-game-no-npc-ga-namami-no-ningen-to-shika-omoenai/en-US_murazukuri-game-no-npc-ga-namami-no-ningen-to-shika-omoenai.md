## Sinopse

An unknown parcel arrives to Yoshio, a 30-year old NEET. The content is a game disk titled "The Village of Fate," a beautiful CG game with real-life images.

All of the villagers in the game are high-performing AIs, who behave remarkably close to human beings. In the game Yoshio takes the role as the god of destiny and is in a position to guide the villagers. But his only options in the game are to give a message, a prophecy, once every day. The villagers will follow the instruction, and their gratitude transforms to the power of miracles, which the god of destiny can use.

Yoshio is worshiped as God but in reality he lives like a shut-in. Thanks to villagers he will again learn the joy of life and thanks to him the villagers will be saved.
