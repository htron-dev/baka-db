## Sinopse

Japan in the Reiwa XX era, where sexual activity is illegal. Inuta Hikaru, an honor student whose father is the director of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's Sexual Enforcement Division, witnesses something shocking at a club he visits for the first time with her friend. There are a lot of people who enjoy sex with a great deal of alcohol and music! And among them is Inuta's favorite idol, Misora. In front of this unusual sight, an impulse that he's never felt runs around Inuta's body.
