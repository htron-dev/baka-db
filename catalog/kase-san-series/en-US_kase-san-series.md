## Sinopse

Yui Yamada has always been a shy girl, keeping to her small circle of friends and fulfilling her duties as the "Plant Appointee" by greenifying the school. Yet, one day, she ends up crossing paths with the track and field team's ace, Tomoka Kase. Kase is outgoing and athletic, while Yamada has never played sports or participated in a club. However, despite being polar opposites, the pair soon find themselves becoming closer.

With lots to learn about relationships, and each other, will their feelings bloom into something more?
