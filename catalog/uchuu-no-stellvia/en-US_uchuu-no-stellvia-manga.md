## Sinopse

The Stellvia Space Academy is one of several Space Foundations dedicated to saving Earth from a wave of supernova explosions that is scheduled to hit the planet in 70 days. Shima Katase is a newly-enrolled student at Stellvia with exceptional skills as a programmer but lacklustre talent as a pilot. Her dream is to be chosen as one of the elite pilots needed to help save the earth, and Stellvia is her story.
