## Sinopse

6 years ago, Koharu lost his beloved cat, Dorasuke. There is not a single day that goes by that he doesn't think of his cat. One day out of the blue, he meets a guy and turns out that it’s Dorasuke! God gave him a second chance to be with Koharu—and this time as a human! But there is a catch—God made him a promise that he must keep... if he breaks the promise, there’ll be consequences…
