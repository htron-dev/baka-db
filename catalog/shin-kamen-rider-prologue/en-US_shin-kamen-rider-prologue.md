Kazamatsuri Shin was your average, everyday motorcycle racer. His father, Daimon, is a scientist hoping to find a way to cure all infectious diseases by strengthening the human body through genetic alteration. Being the good son that he is, Shin volunteers to take part in his father's experiments. Unfortunately for them, his father's research partner Onizuka Giichi has other things in mind for their research.
As things start to snowball, Shin tries to keep himself and his family safe from the clutches of Onizuka, the CIA and even a mysterious organization known as 'The Foundation...' as the powerful Shin Kamen Rider!
