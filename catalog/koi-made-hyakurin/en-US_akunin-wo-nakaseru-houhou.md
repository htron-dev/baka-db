## Sinopse

Kayano is a rich guy, who falls in love with Takao, a guy he found injured. He pities Takao and decides to ask him to give him tuition. That's when he realizes that Takao has a terrible personality. Even so, he still wants to keep Takao as his teacher. Later, a misunderstanding happens and Kayano's mother thinks Takao is only after the money and makes Takao leave. Years later, Takao returns to the household again but as a lawyer who was hired by Kayano's parents over some stupid broken tea ware.
