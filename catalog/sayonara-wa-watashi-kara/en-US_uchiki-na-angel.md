## Sinopse

After losing her husband in an accident the day after their wedding, Josy still holds feelings of guilt one year later. Her life is full of household chores and is dictated by her abusive father. Then Dacre, her late husband's cousin, pays her a visit. He is a refined gentleman, and he invites her to his villa in France for a fresh start in life. Her heart is swayed by his gentle and affectionate eyes. But she knows she can't fall for him. She tells herself she doesn't have the right to love again—her husband is dead... and it's her fault!
