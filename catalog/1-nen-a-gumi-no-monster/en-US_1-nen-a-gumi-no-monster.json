However Class 1-A, infamously known as the \"Class of Monsters,\" is full of bullies, blackmailers, scheming sadists, and other trouble makers. Within a week, every teacher who has taught this class has either quit, resigned, or even been imprisoned.\n\nThe plain-looking Jimi Tarou shall carve out his name and become a legendary teacher.\n\n(Source: MU)",
