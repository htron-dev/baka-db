But there are various obstacles in Mahiro's path! For one thing, he dresses as a girl, named Hanabusu Arisu, when modeling. As if that wasn't enough, every woman in his vicinity gets the urge to spread her legs because of the special pheromone he emits! Will Mahiro ever come to confess his love to Miwa, or will he simply widen his harem and get engulfed in endless orgy? Find out for yourself!\n\n(Source: Imangascans)",
