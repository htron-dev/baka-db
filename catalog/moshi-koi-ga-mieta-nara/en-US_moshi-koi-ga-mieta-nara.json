    "sinopse": "Mei Haruno has a special ability to physically see if someone is in love with another person. Displaying in the shape of big bold red arrow, most people might think this ability is cool, but for Mei it has only brought her hardship and trauma from her fellow classmates. Finished with being an outcast, Mei starts afresh at a girls only high school and vows to never get involved in love and keep her ability secret. But when her old primary school friend comes in with giant love arrows pointing straight for Mei's face, what is Mei to do? And also what is up with this other girl who seems to love her?\n\n(Source: MU)",
