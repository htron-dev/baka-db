    "sinopse": "Hideaki Shizukawa is your typical salaryman, aside from the fact he has a split personality. The real trouble is that they don’t get along. While mild-mannered Hideaki works by day, “Kairi” parties by night, seducing men and bringing them home by the dozen. Hideaki wakes each morning with no memory of the night before, but figures out what’s going on by the hundreds of pictures Kairi leaves of his sexual escapades. To make matters worse, the pictures keep ending up on the internet. Hideaki goes to the office counselor Katsuragi for help, but Kairi seems to be getting in the way. Will Katsuragi be able to reach Hideaki’s true self, or are deep wounds from the past too much for even love?\n\n(Source: MU)",
