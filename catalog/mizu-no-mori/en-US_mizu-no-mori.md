## Sinopse

As Joan of Arc is about to be burned at the stake, she confesses to God that she is sick of people and the atrocities she has seen, and wants to die. Unwilling to let that happen, God sends her to modern-day Japan, giving her three years to make up for the time she lost to her holy mission.
