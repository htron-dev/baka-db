## Sinopse

Keeping their promise, Koga meet Iku-sempai up in Highschool after a short separation. Now, closer than before, Iku starts realizing a hidden feeling of his and struggle to keep it there, hidden. Koga on the other hand aim to prove that he adores Iku to the point of strong love. In the mist of love confusion, Iku treats Koga very meanly, this is because Iku want his feelings to be hidden from Koga, yet at the same time annoyed with the fact that Koga has yet to realize his feelings. Oh my, this is really a tough journey for Koga to Capture the Prince!
