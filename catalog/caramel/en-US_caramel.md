## Sinopse

The eldest son of four brothers in a close-knit family, Iori Kobayashi has come to the big city for college. When he finally does get a roommate, the older and cold Toudou Roku, their first meeting is rocky...to say the least. With character differences, misunderstandings and some surprises mixed in - are first impressions really the only truth when it comes to people?
