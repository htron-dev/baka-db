## Sinopse

Poor first year high school student Matsuri has an awkward encounter with her older brother's extremely popular friend Asahi one day after she gets out of the bath! Ever since then, whether she's home, at school, or wherever, Asahi seems to meddle with her…! Her days have gotten a little sweeter, flirtier, and naughtier when she spends them around Asahi, and it's awful!
