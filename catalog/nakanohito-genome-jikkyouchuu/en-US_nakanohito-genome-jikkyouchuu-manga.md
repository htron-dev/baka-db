## Sinopse

In the online Let's Play community, the video game "The Ones Within - Genome" is infamous. No one has ever successfully completed it, and those who come close vanish without a trace.

Akatsuki Iride is a popular streamer, well known for his amiable nature and the ability to befriend anyone. While playing The Ones Within - Genome, he discovers a hidden stage and is transported to a strange forest. There he meets others like himself: Karin Sarayashiki, a horror game enthusiast; Kaikoku Onigasaki, a Sengoku-themed uploader; nurturing-simulation lover Himiko Inaba; Anya Kuduo, a fighting game expert; puzzle specialist Yuzu Roromori; a master of stealth games, Zakuro Oshigiri; and romance game streamer Makino Aikawa.

In order to escape, they must reach one hundred million concurrent views. Each must put their specialty to the test and entertain the global audience together in a never-ending livestream for their lives.
