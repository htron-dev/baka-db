## Sinopse

Iride Akatsuki has unlocked hidden content in the game he's playing, 'Nakanohito Genome,' and it turns out that this content is a real-life game!
He soon wakes up to find that he has been kidnapped and taken to a strange place, along with a number of other teammates. Each of them specializes in a certain sort of game, like cultivation games, fighting games, puzzle games, etc.
A llama-headed 'teacher' gathers them after level 1 is cleared to explain how the game will proceed.
Will this group of gamers succeed, and make it back to their real lives?
