    "sinopse": "Atsuko is a talented pianist who decided that she would not go out and play the piano in the final round of a Piano Competition. Upset and frustrated she tells her mother and instructor that it was because she just now realized that she doesn't like playing the piano. Trying to get away from everyone at the competition she runs, ending up in Harajuku where she is stunned by it's music scene and the bands playing in the area.\n\nThis is all new to Atsuko. Ever since she was little she's spent her life being trained as a classical musician, in an uptight and restricted environment that pressured her to be the perfect pianist because that was what everyone expected.\n\nNow set on living her own life, Atsuko wants to experience the outside world on her own... but despite what she said to her mother, she still feels the pull of music. She decides to apply for a part-time job at a record company and is soon pulled into the music industry.",
