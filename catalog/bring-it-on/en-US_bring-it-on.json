    "sinopse": "Tomboy Mi-Ha is an extremely active and competitive girl who never likes to lose to anyone. She’s such a tomboy that all boys are scared of her, and that’s exactly what her brother wanted and trained her to be. It took him six long years to train her into a pseudo-military style girl to protect her from anyone else. Bishonen Sung-Suh is a new transfer student who’s got the looks, the determination, and attitude to sweep her off the feet. Could this male beauty be able to tame the beast? Will Miha’s brother let them be together and happily ever after? If you want it you’ve got to Bring It On!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
