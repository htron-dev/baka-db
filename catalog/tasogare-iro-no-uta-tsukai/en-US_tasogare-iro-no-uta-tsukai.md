## Sinopse

This story depicts a fantasy world where objects and living creatures can be summoned through Recitations and the use of special catalysts, along with the aid of Songs of Praise. There are five basic colors of Recitations: Keinez(red) - Ruguz(blue) - Surisuz(yellow) - Beorc(green) - Arzus(white), and each can summon things of its respective color.

Evhemary Yehlemihas announces that she wants to create a new color - Night Color Recitations, and Xins Airwincle aims to be the first person to master all five colors. The two make a promise to meet again in the future and show each other their accomplishments.

In the present day, Neight Yehlemihas is the adopted son of the deceased Evhemary, and the inheritor of the Night Color. At a specialized Recitation school, he meets Kluele, a normal girl studying Red.

Their encounter marks the beginning of a series of events involving the mystery of Recitations…
