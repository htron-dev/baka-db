    "sinopse": "Masculine, cheerful Sakamoto Hideomi, reigning top host at a popular host club, was tricked into taking responsibility for a huge debt. His only recourse is to go home, which he hasn't visited even once in seven years. The only person there is his \"brother\" of the same age Yukiya, although they aren't related by blood.\n\nAs a day trader, Yukiya earns loads, but he has one condition for shouldering the debt: that they live together. However, the reason why Hideomi left the house was his attack on the awkward, beautiful Yukiya...!?\n\nThe dramatic, love-filled story of a popular ex-host and a beautiful day trader!\n\n(Source: Nakama Scanlations)",
