## Sinopse

A collection of cute oneshots. Low smut value but high in adorableness. A good read for anyone because it's humorous and full of cute boys.

1. Reason for Goodbye - Students Yukihisa and Akira were dating secretly until Yukihisa's parents discovered them. They don't speak anymore, and now Yukihisa's family is moving. Is there anything left for them?

2. Snow Snow Melody - Mutsuki wants to be songwriter, but he's only a clumsy intern working at a television station. When the most beautiful guy he's ever seen insults him, Mutsuki hits him in the face with a dust rag! But that guy is Kyoya, a singer in a popular band, and he's taken a liking to Mutsuki.

3. Don't Worry Baby - Takaya has a crush on his classmate Wataru, but Wataru only thinks of his younger brother Tsutomo. When Takaya decides to meet his competition, Wataru gets angry. Can these guys ever sort out their feelings?

4. Difficult Love Journey - Shouhei is in love with his classmate Wataru. But Wataru won't listen to his confession! He says he'll only hear Shouhei out if he can beat his test scores. Will Shouhei ever win?
