## Sinopse

Kou and Yukako were close friends as children until Yukako had to move away due to family debt. Still, Kou remembers Yukako as his first love. Years later, he claims not to be in love with her anymore, yet he only dates girls that remind him of her. Kou and Yukako meet once again, and although Kou has stayed the same, Yukako has changed—she's frail, has to steal to eat, and is living with a strange man she calls her "guardian."
