    "sinopse": "This novel is a sweet and fluffy romcom telling the days of a boyfriend and girlfriend right after they've started dating. The boyfriend, Kairi Watase, 17 years old, is a first-year high school student (two years behind). Having just woken up from a 2-year coma, he's a young man with some problems. The girlfriend, Nano Koori, 16 years old, is also a first-year in high school. A slightly annoying beauty, who loves fashion and anything that sounds interesting. The daily lives of the two basically boil down to this.\n\n\"Senpaaai, am I not super duper cute today~? Come on, it wouldn't hurt to praise me a—\"\n\n\"Yeah, you really are cute.\"\n\n\"~~~!\"\n\n\"Koori?\"\n\n\"—This is exactly what I'm talking about, senpai!\"\n\nA story of a slightly unaware senpai, and the always immediately flustered kouhai. No dangers of a heroine race or a breakup, just a pure and wholesome romcom.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
