Whether it is the future or the past it is the world of fantasy and horror hiding in the shadow of the demon city. In the city, consecutive mysterious incidents that cannot be solved by science have occurred. To solve the incidents, they gather three girl detectives possessing special abilities.

Hayama Kotono. She is an orphan living in a convent.
Shirafuji Natuski. She is Kotono's classmate and a pop idol.
Hijiri Misaki. She is a mysterious girl who fights against nightmares of her previous life.
