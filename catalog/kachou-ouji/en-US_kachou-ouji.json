    "sinopse": "Oji Tanaka has a wife, a child and a mundane job as a salary man in Tokyo's modern society. But life wasn't dull for him to begin with; 15 years ago, he was known as \"Gabriel\", leader of a short-lived heavy metal band called Black Heaven. Oji's life gets a sudden change in direction when he is invited by a mysterious blonde woman named Layla to pick up his Gibson Flying V and once again display his \"legendary\" guitar skills, not knowing that his music generates power for a massive weapon in an intergalactic war.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
