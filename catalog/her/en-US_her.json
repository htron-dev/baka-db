    "sinopse": "HER is a series of character portraits, loosely strung together by everyday circumstances.\n\nThe story begins with a woman who wants to be loveable - and loved - and who has a fixation on shoes. Her hairdresser's fear of the future is the subject of the second chapter. A schoolgirl whose hair she cuts sees her older female neighbor kissing her female lover goodbye. In the past, the neighbor had a difficult relationship with her mother. The neighbor's lover was rejected by her first love. The couple sitting next to them at the cafe have their own issues.\n\n(Source: Okazu)",
