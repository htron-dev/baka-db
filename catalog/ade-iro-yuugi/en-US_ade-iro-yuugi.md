## Sinopse

Ade-iro Yuugi is about Katase who works at a workshop which specializes in the traditional, intricate art of yuzen dyeing. He doesn't get along well with others and deliberately keeps people at a distance. This changes when he's told to allow a friendly young man in training to stay at his place.
