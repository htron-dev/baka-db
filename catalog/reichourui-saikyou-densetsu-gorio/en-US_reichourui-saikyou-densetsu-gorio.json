    "sinopse": "Kusaraki Masao is a normal 15 year-old boy. He goes to school, joined the soccer team, and dreams of a day when he can get a girlfriend. He's nice, gentle, and very, very shy with girls.\n\nAnd why is this Mr. Nice Guy still single? Well....um...he has a face that resembles a gorilla--hence the nickname--Gorio. Despite his best efforts, Gorio couldn't seem to find a girl who will look past his physical visage to the tender heart he has.\n\n(Source: Manga Freak)",
