Rumor has it that he always invites his target to the library and ravishes that person right there and then…\nWhich is why I was totally shocked when he suddenly asked me to join him at the library!?— I’m ecstatic!!!\nMy body is already burning in anticipation—!\n\nWritten under the name Kaou, Saeko.\n\n(Source: Fantasyshrine)",
