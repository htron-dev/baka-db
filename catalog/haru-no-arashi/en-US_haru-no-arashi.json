    "sinopse": "My heart is being swept away on this torrent of passion.\n\nShe absolutely cannot be attracted to him. Absolutely not. Deborah has continued to tell herself this during the four years she's been secretary to Alex, the CEO of a music production company. No matter how passionately he looks at her or how attractive he is, she will not become one of his many women. But when Alex suddenly kisses Deborah, she's not sure what to think anymore. If Deborah plays with a passion this hot, she might get burned, but how can she resist?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
