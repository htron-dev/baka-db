## Sinopse

I, Reikaidou Reiya, preached this to the old man (God).

"I'm actually the one who should be asking. Seriously why? Why?"

It was the one thing I wanted to question the most.

I wonder why I thought i would be okay after jumping off a 30 storey building...

But in any case, it seems that had fulfilled the requirement to be reincarnated into another world.

The power that God had bestowed upon me is Creation Ability—and when i calmed down to make something, konnyaku came out. I don't understand how i'm going to make a living out of this but i should work hard in my next life!!

Anyway, I reincarnated.
