    "sinopse": "I, Reikaidou Reiya, preached this to the old man (God).\n\n\"I'm actually the one who should be asking. Seriously why? Why?\"\n\nIt was the one thing I wanted to question the most.\n\nI wonder why I thought i would be okay after jumping off a 30 storey building...\n\nBut in any case, it seems that had fulfilled the requirement to be reincarnated into another world.\n\nThe power that God had bestowed upon me is Creation Ability—and when i calmed down to make something, konnyaku came out. I don't understand how i'm going to make a living out of this but i should work hard in my next life!!\n\nAnyway, I reincarnated.\n\n(Source: Amazon, translated)",
