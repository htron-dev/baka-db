## Sinopse

Kiku-chan is drawn into the Manga Research Club. This seems like it's a good thing, but Kiku-chan certainly doesn't appear all that happy with it. That may be more because she just doesn't know what to do with her rich, attractive, neighborly next-door neightbor, Hiyoshi-san's outgoing personality.
