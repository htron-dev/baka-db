## Sinopse

Kisaragi Maaya, 16 years old. The first love confession of her life was a complete rejection. She vowed to "never confess to someone again" until one day, the popular Chigira-kun who was on library duty with her, in order to heal his wound of unrequited love, proposed to her that they "heal each others broken hearts"! Everyday, being healed by Chigira-kun, Maaya starts thinking that she wants to be closer... But, this is just comforting each other's broken heart. Even though she definitely can't fall in love with Chigira-kun-!!?
