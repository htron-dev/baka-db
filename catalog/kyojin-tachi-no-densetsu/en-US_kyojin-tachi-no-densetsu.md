## Sinopse

In an alternate prehistory set 60,000 years ago, Earth was inhabited by a highly advanced civilisation of Giants with immense mental faculties and scientific knowledge. Threatened by a predicted new ice age, the Giants decided to artificially warm the atmosphere. A sudden decrease in solar activity foiled their plans, and in desperation they decided to attempt to create a second sun of the solar system.
