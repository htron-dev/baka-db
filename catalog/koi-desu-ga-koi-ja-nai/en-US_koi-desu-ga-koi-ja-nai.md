## Sinopse

Ujihara-kun is a playboy who doesn't get serious when it comes to love. He often plays around behind his girlfriend's back and does not refuse when a girl approaches him, until a certain schoolmate caught him in the act. He turned her into an accomplice and the two had a risky relationship, but will it only be just a form of skinship, or something more will develop?
