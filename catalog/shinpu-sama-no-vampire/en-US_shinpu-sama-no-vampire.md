## Sinopse

Claude, a vampire who just arrived in town seeking fresh blood, meets a handsome man, Father Ruslan. However, while he was thinking about making him his dinner, he's the one who gets eaten!

He also ends up with a seal on his arm, putting him in a state of absolute submission. In the end, Claude becomes the one getting gently nibbled on by Ruslan's pet lycanthrope and by Imp the imp, among others!!
