## Sinopse

An athletically-challenged middle-school student, Hiyori Inaba, is suddenly told by her father that, "he was once a Ninja!". Then, the moment she opened a cellphone box her father gave her, she suddenly became a floppy-eared ninja warrior! This is an action-packed fantasy about the 12 Zodiac Warrior maidens and their battle against mankind's worst enemy, the "Demon Bugs".
