## Sinopse

"I'm the type of person who has trouble entering a conversation."

Meet our protagonist, a meek, shy guy with no presence who has trouble speaking out. One day, he encounters a handsome but strange guy who seems to have an equally hard time in talking to others, and helps him out of a tight spot. As thanks, the bishounen blushes and hands his saviour some chocolates! Could this be the start of something unexpected for this tongue-tied duo...?
