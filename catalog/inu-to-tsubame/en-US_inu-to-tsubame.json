    "sinopse": "During a high school year opening assembly, Kaede is suddenly embraced by Nomiya, an underclassman transfer student. Nomiya reminds Kaede that they spent a summer together as children and proceeds to do everything in his power to re-enter Kaede's life. Kaede is still shaken by the death of his brother, who may have killed himself from the stress and anxiety resulting from an apparent case of gender dissociative disorder. Kaede is therefore reluctant to grant Nomiya the closeness that the younger boy desires, but, despite his confusion, the two end up becoming close friends - and then something more.",
