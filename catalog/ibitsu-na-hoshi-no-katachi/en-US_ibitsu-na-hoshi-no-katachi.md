## Sinopse

A collection of 3 one-shots by author Shiina Karuho.

Ibitsu na Hoshi no Katachi:
Makoto and Aya are opposites but best friends. Makoto is mature and has had many relationships. Aya is naive and has never liked a boy. Yet, nothing has ever come between them until Makoto discovers Aya's secret...

Mou Iikai.:
Kanna is a tomboy who is used to being treated as "just a friend" by other guys, but being used to it doesn't mean that she likes it. Do things finally change when she meets Motonari-kun or is he just like the rest?

Seishun Rhapsody:
Kusano Hiro always seems to have the worst luck. She gets blamed for things she didn't do and is constantly in trouble over misunderstandings. Usami, her classmate, is the exact opposite, so no wonder they don't get along...
