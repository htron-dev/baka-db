## Sinopse

Shigeru Sugiyama, a cafe assistant, suddenly teleports to a fantasy world, where he realizes he is different from the rest. However, it's not in a good way. The younger high school students who teleported to the same world had titles of "Heroes" and "Saints," but Shigeru didn't have any titles to his name. But then it happened again. Shigeru teleported once more, but this time, to the real world!
