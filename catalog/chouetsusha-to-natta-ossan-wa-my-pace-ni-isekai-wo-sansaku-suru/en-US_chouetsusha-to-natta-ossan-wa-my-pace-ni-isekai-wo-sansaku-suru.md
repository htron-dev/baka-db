## Sinopse

Hiroshi Yamada (42 years old), a dull salaryman, was chosen to be a brave warrior which should have been limited to young people. Then he was suddenly sent to another world full of monsters and as a promised gift of his summoning, Hiroshi was given three strong skills by God: [One-shot K.O.], [All Magic Creation], and the ultimate physical strengthening ability [Transcendence].

And so Hiroshi must defeat the monsters one after another by making full use of the given skills. However, he's extremely clumsy and can't control his skills, so they always go out of control. Because of that, Hiroshi meets a cute female fairy and a muscular old warrior to go on his adventures with him. See what happens to Hiroshi as he experiences a different world fighting against monsters and sometimes annoying the townspeople with outrageous acts.
