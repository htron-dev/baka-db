## Sinopse

Created for Saitama Prefecture, the series' 7-minute episodes will promote tourist locations in the Prefecture.

Every episode will include a five-minute story segment that will showcase the prefecture in spring, summer, fall, or winter. Following each story, a two-minute explanation segment will include instructions on how to travel to featured areas from Tokyo by train.

Episodes will include the love story "Sakura no Omoide," the gag comedy story "Saitama Koukou Housou-bu ~Natsu no Kankou Annai~," the fantasy story "Yuusha Higan to Hime-sama no Bouken," and the family story "Winter sweet home." The anime's four episodes will be available in Japanese with subtitles in Japanese, English, Chinese (traditional and simplifed), Korean, and French. Eight people living or working in Saitama were selected from 223 applicants to voice act in the series.
