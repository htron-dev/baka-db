## Sinopse

The "God of High School" is a fierce competition held between Korean high school students to determine the best fighter among them. All styles of martial arts and weapons are allowed. The ultimate prize? The winner's deepest desire will be granted, no matter the cost.

Jin Mo-Ri has been training in taekwondo under his grandfather from a young age. Obsessed with fighting, he enters the tournament to find and challenge stronger opponents. Along the way, he meets Han Dae-Wi, an expert in karate who is determined to become the champion to help his friend who is between life and death, and Yu Mi-Ra, a skilled swordswoman who wants to continue her family's legacy.

Although this tournament seems simple, what more lies in store for Jin Mo-Ri and his friends? And will they be prepared to face what may come to pass?
