## Sinopse

Houjou Yuuji, 30 years old, jobless, hikikomori for the past 10 years.

Using his parents' death as the impetus, he decided to get rid of his hikikomori self and leave the house. However, what he saw outside the door was another world with creatures strutting about that he didn't recognize.

This was a story about a young man who went to the other world with his whole house, with his lifeline (electricity, water, gas) and internet somehow still working, and with his beloved dog Koutarou, living relatively in peace.

Four years after he was transported to this world, finally Yuuji aims to go to his first town...
