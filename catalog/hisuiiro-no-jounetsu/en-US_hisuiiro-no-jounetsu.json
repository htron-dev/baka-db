    "sinopse": "Ariane, a famous reporter, is on her way to a beautiful, huge mansion. The man she will interview, Manolo, is a big shot in the business world with a very intimidating demeanor. Ariane, constantly receiving harassing emails from her former husband, eventually ends up staying at Manolo's mansion. He promptly proposes to her, as the marriage would be beneficial for them both... But a marriage without love! Ariane feels repulsed at the thought, but what if Manolo can truly protect her from her ex-husband?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
