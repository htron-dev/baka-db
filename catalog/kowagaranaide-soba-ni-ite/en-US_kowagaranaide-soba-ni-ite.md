## Sinopse

I thought it would go well for you and me from here on after. "Let's pretend it never happened. From the very beginning."

Ono Shizuka is a baker who got into an argument with his partner Sakai and fell off the stairs. The accident caused him to forget about Sakai entirely. However, he now is very interested in the beautiful but lonely man.
