18-year-old Manami Katagiri has faced hardships his whole life because he had to drop out of middle school and begin working in a factory to take care of his little sister. For reasons he's re-enrolled in high school to better his life but on his first day he encounters a "princess" who he claims has never had to work a day in her life.
