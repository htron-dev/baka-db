## Sinopse

Takaomi and Arika meet a young girl named Tsugumi Yoshimoto who has been asleep since an incident that occurred when she was a child. What happened in her past? And can she be cured? The couple try to solve this mystery with the help of the Mishima sisters--Toko and Rinko, who are Yume Tsukai (dream messengers) with the uncanny ability to control dreams. What is the truth behind this mystery?

This is a prelude to Riichi Ueshiba's next work, Yume Tsukai where Mishima sisters make a comeback as main characters.
