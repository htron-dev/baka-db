    "sinopse": "Haruyoshi is an extremely good-natured person who is too easily fooled by people. While searching for a job to pay for his grandfather's medical expenses, a young man with a mysterious aura calls out to him at a park: Sora, who introduces him to a part-time job that's almost too good to be true. But, it turned out to be an outrageous job where he has to live stream (pretend) sex with Sora?! A silly love comedy between a good-natured ikemen and a beautiful artist with poor emotions!\n\n(Source: Takeshobo, translated)",
