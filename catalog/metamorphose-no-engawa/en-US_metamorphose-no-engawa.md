## Sinopse

The pattern of love between young men; is what the 75-year-old lady encounters.

After discovering the coffee shop, that she shared precious memories with her late husband, has closed down, she drops by the local bookshop, finding that the cookbook corner has been relocated. As she passes by feeling lonely, a certain manga volume catches her eye.

The 75-year-old lady, who came to know of BL and the high school girl who works at the bookstore—brings us a story of the days that no one has yet seen.
