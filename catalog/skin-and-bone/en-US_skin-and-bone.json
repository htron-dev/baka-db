    "sinopse": "Bullied incessantly because of her weight, Maki decides to go on a diet. Soon she is slim and beautiful, and envied by all her classmates. But her weight loss doesn't stop there, and she grows thinner and thinner...until she is nothing but skin and bone. Other stories include the slug girl's revenge, the secret sister that Ms. Numata hides from the world, the red satchel that mysteriously turns up at school, and Caterpillar, the nickname given to Mayuko because of her love of the creatures.
