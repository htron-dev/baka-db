## Sinopse

From Wataame Shoujo:

This manhwa is about a boy Yoon, Ah-so who's staying with his aunt while his parents go to live in a different country. As soon as his parents leave, Ah-so transforms himself from a nerd with glasses to a novice player with dyed hair. His aunt's place turns out to be next door to his girl classmate Na, Ban-di's house. Ban-di has a best friend Kang, Shi-ool, a girl who may or may not like Ban-di as more than a friend. There are two other guy classmates, Na, Mashi and Shin, Sae-ba, who are also pretty close. The story explores the relationship between these characters.
