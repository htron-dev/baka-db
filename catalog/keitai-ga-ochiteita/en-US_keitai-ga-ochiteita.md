Keitai ga Ochiteita:
On her way back from a date with her boyfriend, Momoka finds a cell phone on the ground. She receives a text message on it that makes it seem like its owner is nearby watching her. Scared, Momoka brings the cell phone to a nearby police station where her ex-boyfriend works. What is behind this mysterious cell phone?

Seven Piece:
Shinohara Kurumi was blind for four years until she received a retinal transplant and could see once again. Kaidou Shuuichi, her cousin, took care of her during that time and has considered her his fiancee ever since. This all threatens to change, however, when one day, a mysterious boy approaches Kurumi and asks her if she is happy.
