## Sinopse

Yoshie Okahara moves from Hokkaido to Tokyo and discovers that it's much too hot during the summer for her tastes. A big part of that is the fact that her sweat and tears are nitroglycerin, leading to some rather explosive situations whenever she gets too hot or starts crying.

Originally serialized in the non-magazine manga anthology "Petit Apple Pie", it was later serialized in Shounen Captain.
