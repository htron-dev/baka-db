## Sinopse

Niko can't say her true feelings and spends her days wearing down her nerves trying to match up with her surroundings. But everything changes when the eccentric transfer student, Sugi, starts causing trouble with his extreme straightforwardness and intolerance for pretenses. Cringe-worthy hilarity ensues.
