    "sinopse": "Makoto is suddenly confessed to by her narcissistic childhood friend Kikuchi Reita. Not even just any confession, he stands in the street and publicly says \"If you want a boyfriend that badly, I don't mind going out with you.\" Which was obviously a no, since Makoto has never considered Reita to be a man, especially a man of interest. What will become of her daily life now that Reita insists on her going out with him?\n\n(Source: MU)",
