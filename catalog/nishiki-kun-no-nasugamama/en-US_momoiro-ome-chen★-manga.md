## Sinopse

Science geek Yuuhi Toganou has just invented the girl of his dreams, Momo-chan! But right as he anticipates losing his virginity to his creation, gyaru girl Sara Ayanokouji interrupts him and pushes the button that activates Momo-chan. Yuuhi's creation explodes, and when the dust settles, he finds out that he and Sara have switched bodies! Sara is calm about it, saying she's always wanted to be a boy, and she has plans of doing everything it means to be a man, including sex! Will Yuuhi's former body lose its virginity before his soul does!?
