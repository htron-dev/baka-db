This is a tale about Tomioka Sakito, a handsome young owner of a Dog Cafe, and Kanade Sakuza who likes small children and animals, but doesn't know how to get along with them, and instead, frightens them. When the two finally get along, Kanade finds out that Sakito is married and has a kid. What's the story behind that...?
