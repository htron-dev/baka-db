    "sinopse": "There's an unusual restaurant located in the suburbs of Japan, and we invite you to take a look at the livelihoods of its staff. Does it appeal to your senses to mention they're all cookware personified? Pandra Restaurant begins with a cutting board's journey to find his own place in the restaurant—it's not easy being a plastic cutting board amongst more experienced utensils, but he'll make the most of it!\n\n(Source: DMG)",
