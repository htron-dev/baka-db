## Sinopse

Atsushi and Yumiko seem to have the perfect relationship. They're both cute. They're both sweet. They make each other happy (in the bedroom and outside of it), and they'd do anything for one another...well, almost anything. Yumiko refuses to cook for Atsushi. Atsushi himself is an excellent chef who always cooks for Yumiko, and it drives him up the wall when he realizes how unfair it is that his beloved girlfriend won't hold up her end of the bargain. With Valentine's Day around the corner, Atsushi notices girls baking sweets at every turn. Unfortunately, none of those girls are Yuimko. She claims her cooking is terrible, but Atsushi would be happy if she'd at least try! Get a taste of love, laughs, drama, and chocolate with How to Make Her Delicious!
