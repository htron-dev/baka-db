Welcome to Attraction Land.

You all have been brought to this world famous amusement park for a certain task that you have been promised an extraordinary reward for helping us with.

Oh, and we would like for you to provide at least three points of improvement for each attraction. Answer everything and do not leave any spaces on your form blank. It does not matter how small a thing it is... Now, it is time to begin monitoring.
