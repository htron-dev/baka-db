We will be asking you to carry out a simple monitoring. We will be showing you documents outlining some experimental attractions as well as image videos for them. Oh, and we would like for you to provide at least three points of improvement for each attraction. Answer everything and do not leave any spaces on your form blank. It does not matter how small a thing it is... Now, it is time to begin monitoring.\n\n(Source: official description)",
