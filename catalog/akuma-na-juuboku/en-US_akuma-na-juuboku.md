## Sinopse

There is a place where anyone can be a princess, it's a Hime cafe, the place where the heartbroken Shiori meets the servant Kisaragi, Kind and cool... a real dream boy, or so she thought. But in real life he's mean and bullies her. There's even rumors about him being a former yankee as well.

He's an employee at the cafe and acts completely different at school, but while she is always being teased by the normal Kisaragi, she just can't stop her love for him... Aside from the title, it's a sweet love story for girls.
