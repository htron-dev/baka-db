## Sinopse

Momo and Hinata got along so well together that people around them asked if they were going out. Momo really likes Hinata and can’t wait to break down the wall of ‘friendship’. “It’d be great if Hinata feels the same way”… Momo wishes. However, she accidentally said that she liked someone else in front of everyone and their relationship heads off in an unexpected direction… A title work that illustrates the two enduring pain while advancing in love with 5 other documented chapters.
