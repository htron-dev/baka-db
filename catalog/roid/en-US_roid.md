## Sinopse

"I'm jealous of you..."

A girl from a robot club in a wheelchair, Futagami Yui, looks up to heroes and wants to create one, so she enlists the help of an underclassman, the talented A.I. architect Kazumiya Reina, to build an android together. When it's almost finished and only the A.I. needs to be sorted out, someone kidnaps Reina. Yui curses her inability to do anything because of her legs and resolves to perform an illegal "mind copy" to save her junior...

This is the log of adolescence of girls living in a world where humans and androids coexist.
