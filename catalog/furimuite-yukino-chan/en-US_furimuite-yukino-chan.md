## Sinopse

University classes have commenced, and Arata Hasumi is just one of the confused freshmen cluelessly navigating the campus. Fortunately, an unnamed senior shows Arata around the place, making Arata optimistic toward his first day in college.

Furthermore, on his first day of school, Arata will finally get the chance to meet his online friend, Yukino. Yukino has always given Arata sweet words of encouragement during the summer; since then, Arata has fallen in love with her. Unbeknownst to Arata, the senior who helped him earlier is the very same Yukino whom he hopes to meet! When Arata discovers that his online friend is a guy, the optimistic freshman cannot help but be devastated. Despite this, Arata slowly realizes that he is deeply in love with him and his kind words. Arata sees Yukino as someone special, and someday, he hopes that Yukino will look at him the same way as well.
