## Sinopse

Assigned the job of clearing a client's haunted house of valuables, Takamura Rei must take along first-time handyman Kuramoto, a man with search and rescue experience and a troubled past. But when Rei realizes that he's actually pretty freaked out by haunted houses, he's glad to have the unsociable Kuramoto around. How will their story develop?
