    "sinopse": "With eyes the color of blood, Satsuki Minazuki can see death; specifically, she can see the illusion of corpses exactly 24 hours before they manifest in reality. Unfortunately, her reputation as a compulsive liar who spews ominous warnings about impending deaths means that no one ever believes her—even though she has never once told a lie.\n\nShunned by her classmates, Satsuki is accustomed to being alone, until she prevents the death of the ever-kind Komako Komachi. This small deviation in fate ripples outward, creating a massive change. What lengths will Satsuki go to in order to save a life?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
