    "sinopse": "Deep in the mountains, there is a temple where children with beautiful hair colours have been gathered and have lived together since very young. One day, a newcomer from the outside world joins these children, and he happens to have the rarest colour of them all: jet-black. Unaccustomed to the culture and way of life of the temple-dwellers, how will he fare in this new environment?\n\n(Source: KCG Scans)",
