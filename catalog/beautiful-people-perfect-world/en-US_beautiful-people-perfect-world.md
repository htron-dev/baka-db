## Sinopse

In the future, many arts and sciences have stagnated, but cosmetic surgery has been developed to the extreme. Now people can cheaply and easily change their appearance, not only to become more beautiful, but also to gain inhuman attributes, like cat ears or wings. The short stories in these volumes focus on various situations that arise as a result of this advanced technology. People can switch genders or change their apparent age, and some people also make themselves deliberately ugly. There are also highly regretted surgeries, such as the otaku who makes himself into an anime character, or those who take 'bigger is better' a little too far to the extreme in modifying their sexual characteristics. It is a strange new world of cosmetic surgery and there are many stories to be told!
