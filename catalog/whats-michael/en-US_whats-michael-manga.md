## Sinopse

What's Michael follows the adventures of a ginger tabby called Michael. The stories often change setting: in one, Michael may be owned by a young Japanese couple; in the next, Michael may be owned by an older couple with children and in a third, Michael might be owned by a yakuza. There are even story settings that place groups of cats in business suits or playing baseball in sport team uniforms.
