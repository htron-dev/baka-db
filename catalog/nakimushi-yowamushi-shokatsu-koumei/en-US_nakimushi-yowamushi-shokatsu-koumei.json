    "sinopse": "\"Shokatsu Koumei\", also known as Zhuge Liang. Among the few heroes that decorated the Annals of the Three Kingdoms, it was once a prestigious name. An account of \"an ingenious tactician\", the thousand-year-old story of the \"God of Stratagem\". It is said… \"in a country torn by factions and transformed into a devastating and cruel hell, the heavens sought peace by sending a composed, well-loved young man of impeccable and divine virtues.\" Well, well. In truth… He is a childish man.\n\n(Source: MU)",
