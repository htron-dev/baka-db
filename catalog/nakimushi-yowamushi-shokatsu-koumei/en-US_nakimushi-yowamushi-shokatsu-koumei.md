## Sinopse

"Shokatsu Koumei", also known as Zhuge Liang. Among the few heroes that decorated the Annals of the Three Kingdoms, it was once a prestigious name. An account of "an ingenious tactician", the thousand-year-old story of the "God of Stratagem". It is said… "in a country torn by factions and transformed into a devastating and cruel hell, the heavens sought peace by sending a composed, well-loved young man of impeccable and divine virtues." Well, well. In truth… He is a childish man.
