## Sinopse

Sensei, the person whom I long for, whom I wait for, whom I love, and whom I want to be with. At night, I always think about you, Sensei. You are a similar to me, but you have a completely different personality. At that moment I fell in love with him, school has become a different kind of place because of him. Our love has begun to grow between Sensei and me.

A tearing-off love story by Watanabe Shiho. Also includes another story called Fake Letter - Usotsuki na Koibumi.
