## Sinopse

Ai was your normal, everyday grade teenage girl until one day, she was involved in a fatal car accident. In the hands of the Specialized Secret Police Organization, she was able to be revived. With her newly gained powers acquired through the operation, she becomes a defender of justice. With the mysterious (and a little perverted) bishounen Sagiriya Shinogu as her partner, she fights the forces of evil!
