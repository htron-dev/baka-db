Fujishima can't seem to leave Gojou alone because Gojou is a clumsy blockhead who can't even throw away trash properly! Fujishima thinks that Gojou, who slowly becomes dependent on him, is cute...but then someone who knows Gojou appears all of a sudden, bringing a twist into their budding relationship!\n\n(Source: Gentosha Comics, translated)",
