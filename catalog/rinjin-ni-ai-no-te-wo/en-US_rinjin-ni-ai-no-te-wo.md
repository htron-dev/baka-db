## Sinopse

A detective named Fujishima lives for his job. One day, he befriends his neighbor, Mitsuru Gojou, who just moved into his apartment. Fujishima can't seem to leave Gojou alone because Gojou is a clumsy blockhead who can't even throw away trash properly! Fujishima thinks that Gojou, who slowly becomes dependent on him, is cute...but then someone who knows Gojou appears all of a sudden, bringing a twist into their budding relationship!
