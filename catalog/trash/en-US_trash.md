## Sinopse

High school students by day and contract killers by night, Bullet and Francesca are knees deep in the underworld. The combination of close quarters and marksman fighting styles makes them a duo to be reckoned with.

Explosive marksman Lucia "Bullet" Ishikawa and dual axe-wielding psycho Maine "Francesca" Shirato both work under Minoko Konomi, the boss of the Kanto Iwashi family, who also happens to be a high school girl. Following Minoko's orders, the duo completes their assignments without a hitch.

Their missions put them in constant contact with the trash of society: thugs, serial killers, criminal kingpins, rapists, and assassins. Every time, Bullet and Francesca deal with them in the messiest of waysâ€”in a maelstrom of guts, blood, and flesh.
