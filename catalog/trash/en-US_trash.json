    "sinopse": "High school students by day and contract killers by night, Bullet and Francesca are knees deep in the underworld. The combination of close quarters and marksman fighting styles makes them a duo to be reckoned with.\n\nExplosive marksman Lucia \"Bullet\" Ishikawa and dual axe-wielding psycho Maine \"Francesca\" Shirato both work under Minoko Konomi, the boss of the Kanto Iwashi family, who also happens to be a high school girl. Following Minoko's orders, the duo completes their assignments without a hitch.\n\nTheir missions put them in constant contact with the trash of society: thugs, serial killers, criminal kingpins, rapists, and assassins. Every time, Bullet and Francesca deal with them in the messiest of waysâ€”in a maelstrom of guts, blood, and flesh.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
