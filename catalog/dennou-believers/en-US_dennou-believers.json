    "sinopse": "Transferring to a new school is never easy. Still, Rui has a plan to make new friends—after-school clubs! Unfortunately, they're not that easy to find. The clubs are being closed down one by one, and further investigation reveals the culprit to be Natori, a fellow student—and the guy Rui's father just betrothed her to! It's hard to make friends when your fiancé is the school bully, but Rui's not giving up. With the help of three quietly determined students and two cute boys, Rui forms a club that refuses to be shut down without a fight. As the Computer Believers spread their message online, they're out of Natori's jurisdiction—and Ctrl+Alt+Deleting all the rules!\n\n(Source: Go! Comi)",
