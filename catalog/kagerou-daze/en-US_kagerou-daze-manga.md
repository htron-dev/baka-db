## Sinopse

Shintarou Kisaragi—a NEET who shut himself inside his room for two years—had been living his life normally until he met a cyber girl named Ene, who appeared in his computer screen when someone anonymously sent him a mysterious e-mail one year ago. One day, Ene messes with Shintarou's PC, which forces him to go to the outside world for the first time in two years.
