    "sinopse": "Rin Hashiba has only one wish: to fall in love. Even though she doubts the existence of a god, she still prays that she will find her special someone. But her prayers are soon answered in a most peculiar way when Char, the demon king of Avalon, crashes through her roof!\n\nWhen Rin demands that he fixes the damage caused, Char discovers that his magic powers have been drained and that the cure for his situation is Rin herself, specifically her virgin blood. Will Char just take what he needs and leave? Rin doesn't know, but as they grow closer to each other, she can't help but feel the burn of his smoldering eyes.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
