## Sinopse

A recluse becoming Queen?! In a contest for the throne with scions of noble families, I'll do everything in my power to avoid getting embroiled in it!

In the Kingdom of Lindtor, renowned for being governed by a wise ruler, I, Francesca, am the King's granddaughter—a homebody who delights in chess and staying indoors. However, in the wake of my grandfather's sudden demise, it's revealed that he nominated me in his will as a Queen candidate.

While I was stricken with panic, several young noblemen competing to become sovereign appeared before me: the radiant yet overbearing Stewart, the highly intelligent Cyan, and the captain of the knights, Irwine. "Please choose the King from amongst them!" I struggle hard against it, but my efforts are futile. Furthermore, "I pledge my allegiance to you, my Queen." Is that supposed to be an oath, or a marriage proposal?

I'll get back my peaceful and tranquil days!

What will result from this shut-in princess's desperate resistance?
