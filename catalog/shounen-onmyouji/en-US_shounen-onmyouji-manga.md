## Sinopse

Abe no Masahiro, grandson of the famous Abe no Seimei, is always looked down because he could not see spirits. But he saw them when he was younger? After some unexpected occurrences, he can see spirits once more and must try to prove to himself that he isn't just "Seimei's grandson" with the help of Mokkun, the so-called mononoke.
