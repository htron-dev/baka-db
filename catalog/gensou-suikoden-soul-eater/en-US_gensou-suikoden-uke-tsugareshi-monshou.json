    "sinopse": "Due to the friendship he had with Ted, McDohl's attempt to save him eventually turned his life around from being the son of General Teo McDohl of the Imperial Army to become a wanted enemy of the Empire. A chosen bearer of one of the 27 True Runes, his encounters with death were already foreboding the moment the True Rune was attached to his right hand. Yet, McDohl continues to walk upon the journey through the Empire: facing corruption, cruelty and the life-changing decisions he has to make in order to restore order and peace for the people in his country and to fulfill the hope of many that was entrusted to him.\n\nBased on the PSOne video game, it is also loosely based on the Water Margin classics, though it's limited only to the gathering of 108 Stars of Destiny in order to overthrow a corrupt government.\n\n(Source: MU)",
