This all changes the day he goes to pick up his nephew from kindergarten when he instantly falls in love with a new teacher there. But before Hikaru can declare his feelings, his nephew says, \"Sensei's going to be my wife in the future!\" Is Hikaru's rival in love really his five-year-old nephew?\n\n(Source: MU)",
