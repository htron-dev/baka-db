## Sinopse

Hikaru dreams of becoming a chef. However, nothing's going right in his life—he's just been dumped, and has few job prospects. This all changes the day he goes to pick up his nephew from kindergarten when he instantly falls in love with a new teacher there. But before Hikaru can declare his feelings, his nephew says, "Sensei's going to be my wife in the future!" Is Hikaru's rival in love really his five-year-old nephew?
