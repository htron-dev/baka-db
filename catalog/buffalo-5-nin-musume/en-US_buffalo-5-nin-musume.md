## Sinopse

The girls are sold as prostitutes in the towns that dot the arid desert. Each of them is forced to receive the lusts of men for their own reasons, and each of them fall in love. They have men they are in love with, but prostitutes aren't free to choose who they love. "Love or life, which is more important to you?" "I pick love." "But you can't be in love if you're dead." Is there a way for these women to survive in a world filled with lust and violence? One day, Candy and Susie run from the brothel, seeking the freedom they can never hand. "We are stronger creatures!" Obey your instincts— the voice from within!
