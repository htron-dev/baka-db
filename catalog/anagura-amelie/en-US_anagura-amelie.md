## Sinopse

As an avid movie watcher running her own blog, Ameri Morikawa has no time for romance or mingling with the in-crowd. Often, she ends up watching movies alone. Still, she is plenty satisfied having only two friends with similar mindsets, although they pursue different interests.

Like any other day, Ameri heads to the cinema by herself. She accidentally drops her notebook along the way, but Teito Minamizato, her former crush, returns it to her. Through this encounter, Ameri recalls a time in middle school when he confessed to her. Back then, Ameri believed it was a joke, but Teito insists he was quite serious!

With this realization, Ameri is determined to confess like she should have done years ago, and maybe reignite a romance that never even started.
