## Sinopse

Bartender Yuki has a secret that he can't tell anyone: he's a beastman. He's in love with the stuck-up Godai, a regular at the bar who hunts beastmen. If his secret gets out, then he won't be able to see Godai again, let alone love him, but after Godai gets kicked out of his apartment, he decides to live with Yuki?!
