## Sinopse

lessed with looks and brains, Tsubasa is cool with everyone except the devil-may-care Tokimaru, whom he refuses to open his heart to, in fear of Tokimaru's safety. As fate would have it, they are both dragged into another dimension when an unknown entity attacks them and tries to snatch the "secret" from Tsubasa. For 2 months, these two venture in the wonderland where pirates and wizards roam! What in the world is the "secret"? And who is the blond pirate, Silver, who seems to be helping them?
