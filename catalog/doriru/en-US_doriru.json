    "sinopse": "Growing up in a wealthy family, Nakaido Riru grew up a sheltered life, void of any pain or hardships. Although she has nearly endless resources at her fingertips, she pursued her lifelong dream of being a teacher and changing the world one child at a time. Riru's first job is at Tombori South Elementary School, but, lacking common sense, she doesn't realize Tokyo and Osaka are 3 hours away. Although she was nearly 6 hours late to her first day, she soon captures the hearts of the children because of her passion and courage to stand up for what she thinks is right and wrong.\n\n(Source: MU)",
