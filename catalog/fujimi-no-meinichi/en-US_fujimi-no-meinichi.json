    "sinopse": "Touma Mikado, heir to Mikado Holdings has it all—fame, looks, wits and reputation. He's the dream guy everybody wants and girls fawn all over him. Unfortunately for them, Touma finds them dull and knows that most of them just want him for his money. One day, Touma gets ambushed by street goons which leads him to meeting his eccentric savior Fujimi who helps people as a hobby, without asking anything in return. Curious about Fujimi's kindness, Touma insists that he pay him back and learn more about the man himself. It seems Fujimi is more than what meets the eye.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
