## Sinopse

Hitoshi Kobe is pretty dumb, not good at sports, and extremely unpopular. The only thing he IS good at really is creating artificial intelligence programs on his computer. His greatest work is number 30, one which very accurately simulates talking to an actual girl. One dark and stormy night, a freak lightning strike causes number Thirty to emerge from his computer screen as a real girl, and sends Hitoshi's life on a turn for the crazy.
