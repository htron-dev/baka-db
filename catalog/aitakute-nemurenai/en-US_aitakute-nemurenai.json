    "sinopse": "Josie's still a virgin and she's reluctant to go to her school reunion because she knows her spiteful classmate will laugh at her if she goes alone. A friend suggests Josie hire an escort for the night, and that's just what she does. The escort who arrives at her door is Callum, a man so handsome he seems to have stepped out of a dream. He plays the part of her boyfriend perfectly and Josie finds herself drawn to him. When they return from the reunion, Josie's house has been burgled! Which is why Callum agrees to stay the night at her house... just to be safe.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
