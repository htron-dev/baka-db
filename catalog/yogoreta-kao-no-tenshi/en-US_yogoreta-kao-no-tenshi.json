    "sinopse": "They made an unlikely pair... Prudence and twelve-year old Dan were foundlings, and the dangers in northern mill had pushed them into escape. She also stripped a scarecrow for boy's clothes after a close encounter with a lustful farmer! It was sheer bad luck they were in the way when Sebastian, Lord Wentworth's coach came bowling round the corner. Sebastian took them up with him on his journey south into Kent, but Pru was sure of two things—he mustn't discover she was a girl, and she would continue to search for her family—no matter how her feelings kindled for Sebastian.\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
