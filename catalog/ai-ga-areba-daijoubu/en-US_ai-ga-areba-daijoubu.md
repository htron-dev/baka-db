## Sinopse

When Mizuha applies to a suspicious job posting, he’s welcomed into the position by Satake, the cool yet unquestionably shady company secretary. Suddenly Mizuha finds himself working for a company that peddles “adult goods” while the enigmatic Satake tries to get into his pants at every turn. What’s Mizuha to do when he’s at Satake’s mercy?
