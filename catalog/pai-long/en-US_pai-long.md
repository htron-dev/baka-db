## Sinopse

A unique take on the anit-hero theme, "White Dragon"'s main character is Tatsuto Shriakawa: a pragmatic, cold, nearly-emotionless, independent witness protection agent-thing. Anyway, his life is pretty much ok for him until one day a young girl Ayaka Nozawa knocks on his door asking for help. One thing leads to another and soon the two of them are fighting off criminals ad protecting the innocent, to an extent. Well worth a look at.
