## Sinopse

Rio's family moved when he was a kid. Although he thought he didn't need any friends, he became close with their neighbor's son, Takeru Watanabe. Years later, they are in high school, but Rio has been trying to avoid Takeru since junior high—when he realized his feelings were deeper than friendship.
