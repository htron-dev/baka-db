## Sinopse

Sawa hates Judo. She was once really good at it, but boys always rejected her because she was so strong. Now she's entering high school and the gorgeous captain of the Judo club has selected Sawa (against her will) to be the club manager! He also claims he knows her from the past... How will Sawa deal with managing the sport she hates most, especially since the captain seems to like her!?

Includes two side stories
