The son of a genius magician, Yoichi Takato has been something of a polymath ever since his high school days. However, his high school days are marked by boredom and an inability to open his heart to others. When he happens to join the magic club, he meets with friends whom he can finally open his heart to. But then, the curtain rises on a terrifying murder show! A spinoff story with Hajime Kindaichi’s nemesis from "Kindaichi Case Files", "the hellish puppet master" Yoichi Takato must solve this murder case, even though he is still in high school!!
