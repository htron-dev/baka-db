    "sinopse": "After \"ruining\" Ghost in the Shell and Nodame Cantabile, the writer/director/Flash animator Frogman's Calorie Mate sponsored Channel 5.5 parodies its next target, Riyoko Ikeda's influential shoujo classic Rose of Versailles. Mayo Suzukaze reprises her role as Oscar François de Jarjayes, a girl raised as a man to become her father's successor as leader of the French royal Palace Guards, which Suzukaze previously performed in the Takarazuka Revue stage musical adaptation of the work.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
