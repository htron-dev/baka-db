    "sinopse": "This is the sequel to the popular Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo franchise, set 20 years after the original version.\n\nHajime is no longer a student detective, but is a poor office worker who has to deal with the daily pains of adulthood. No longer wanting to solve cases anymore, he keeps his head down and tries to go about his daily work as quietly as possible.\n\nBut crime never takes a break, and it isn't long before Kindaichi gets dragged into cases that occur around him. Starting off the new series, we revisit Uta Island, for the fourth edition of the Opera House Murder Case, where the Phantom of the Opera is planning a bloody revenge.\n\n(Source: MU)",
