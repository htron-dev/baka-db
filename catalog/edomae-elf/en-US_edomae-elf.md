## Sinopse

Tsukishima, Chuo-ku, Tokyo. Takamimi Shrine has a history of more than 400 years, dating back to the Edo period. This shrine's deity is Elda, a hikikomori elf who was summoned from another world. With her eternal lifespan, she accumulated otaku knowledge as well as the traditions passed down from Edo to Reiwa, while enjoying her civilized life.
