## Sinopse

Well, in a word, Kang Yurhan was the "luckiest" guy. The only son of a rich family with an attractive face and body wrapped up into a perfect package... BUT, God is jealous? Because of a crash in the stocks, his father's company is bankrupt! Loan sharks everywhere are creating trouble for him, and, so, to repay his debts he's sold himself to a famous match maker, Miss Chunja, and has to move to the country... What is a young person supposed to do now...?!
