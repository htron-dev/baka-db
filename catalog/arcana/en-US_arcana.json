As the story unfolds, Murakami and Nakabayashi have been assigned to a serial bombing case that specifically targeted elementary school kids. Neither of them have any idea of what to go about. Their only source: the prophecy of a patient suffering from amnesia and currently undergoing rehabilitation at a local mental clinic. The detectives try to uncover the secret behind the mystery girl as job reassignments and supernatural occurrences occur more and more frequently.",
