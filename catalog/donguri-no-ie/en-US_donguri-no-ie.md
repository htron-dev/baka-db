## Sinopse

The Takazis' only daughter named Keiko was born seriously handicapped, deaf and dumb and mentally handicapped. Her parents tried to accept her handicap but their suffering continued.
Things changed after Keiko entered a deaf and dumb school. Not only Keiko but also her parents grew up with friendship and cooperation of the teachers and friends. They established a group named "Donguri" (acorn) to make a community workshop where the handicapped people could be independent.
