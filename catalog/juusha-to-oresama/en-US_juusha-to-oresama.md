## Sinopse

1-4)Being the willful, extravagant 3rd prince, Philnaldo frequently graces the cover of tabloids with his scandalous affairs with women. This annoys his personal attendant, Ralph, to no end! Then Philnaldo propositioned him unexpectedly; in exchange for dropping all his women, Ralph would take their place… in his bed! A royal love story of a prince and his servant, where both refuse to face the true feelings of their hearts… but what happens when a crisis occurs!?

5. The Garden in the Past- Ichika is in elementary school when his father dies. His mother takes him to live with Yuu, a mysterious young man who has a connection to Ichika's father. As his mother becomes more unstable, Ichika grows more dependent on Yuu...

6)Darling 2002- Nishihara is odd-ball president of the puppet club, (yes, that's right, puppet club) and desperate to keep it from being shut down. What he needs is a new member but grabbing the person next to you isn't a good idea when you're standing by Moriya Koyo, the scariest guy in school. Moriya tells Nishihara off, but entranced by his beautiful voice, Nishihara becomes determined to win Moriya over to the puppet club! Stalking, badgering, and chasing, nothing is off limits for Nishihara.
