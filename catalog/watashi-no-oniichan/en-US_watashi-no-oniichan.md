## Sinopse

A series of "bishōjo"-centered manga booklets that were released weekly for a short time in Japan.

The manga would come packaged with a limited edition plastic-figure assembly kit, designed by Ohshima Yuki, of the featured character of the week:
Volume 1 - New! - Figure for volume 1 - Mion
Volume 2 - Two! - Figure for volume 2 - Ashita
Volume 3 - Hot! - Figure for volume 3 - Harusame
Volume 4 - Why!? - Figure for volume 4 - Sonome
Volume 5 - Bye! - Figure for volume 5 - Eruron
Bonus volume - eXtra! - Figure for bonus volume - Tetora

There is a conspicuous absence of the brothers (oniichan) of the title, as only the little girls are 'portrayed.
