    "sinopse": "This is the story of a girl who works as a performer at sake houses, but who has a unique ability. She has a tattoo of an eye on her hand which endows her with the ability of \"second sight.\" Though this often comes in handy, it also complicates her life. She is constantly getting involved in situations with various supernatural creatures, such as animal spirits, kappas, and more.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
