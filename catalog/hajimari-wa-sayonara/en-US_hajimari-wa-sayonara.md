## Sinopse

Kurosu Kei likes mediocrity, works in a normal office and goes out on dates with guys… But he is not human. In fact, the reason for him to go out on dates, is that he feeds the vital energy of the people with whom he goes out. Still, he never is completely satisfied and fed, but this changes when he meets Kyle Shou, the owner of a hotel. However, it seems that this intense man knows the past…?
