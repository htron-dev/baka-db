## Sinopse

Sai Suzuzono, chief of the Science Club, spends all of her time developing crazy experiments to satisfy her curiosity, like a real "mad scientist." The only one involved in the security of her antics is Ren Nagakura, the class committee chairman; but Ren, despite being the class chairman, is also little out-of-sync with other people (meaning: she's an idiot).

And with her, Sai's weird experiments always turn out even weirder...
