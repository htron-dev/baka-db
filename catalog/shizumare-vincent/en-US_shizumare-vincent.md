## Sinopse

In middle school, Kimie was a loner who spent most of her time indulging in chuuni fantasies, particularly through a poorly-drawn self-insert manga featuring a handsome knight named Vincent. After the embarrassment of the whole class making fun of her art, she burns as much of it as possible, and completely changes her image for a fresh start in high school. However, one of her classmates immediately finds out about her drawings, and she starts getting bullied. Right as her high school life looks like it's over before it's even begun, Vincent suddenly comes to her rescue! But only she can see him, and he looks just as bad as she drew him... How will Kimie escape from her embarrassing past now that it's literally following her around?
