## Sinopse

It was a fake wedding devised to make her sister happy. Only Rita should have known about her plan. Even her boss, Sakir, whose name she used for the groom shouldn't have known.... So why is he standing in the aisle, clad in a caftan fit for a king? He then spoke to the pale-faced Rita. "You must come with me to my home country as my bride. For business."
