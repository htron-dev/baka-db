    "sinopse": "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\n\nThe evil Galactic Empire reigns with oppressive might. Backed by the power of the Death Star, a planet-destroying space fortress, the Empire's rule seems all but assured. All that stands between them and supreme domination is the ragtag Rebel Alliance, a group determined to restore peace and freedom across the galaxy.\n\nWhen the Rebellion manages to steal plans of the Death Star, they are tracked down by the Empire's enforcer, Darth Vader. Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, a secret rebel spy, hides the plans on the droid R2-D2 before being captured. As Leia is dragged off to the Death Star, R2-D2 and its droid companion, C-3PO, escape to the nearest planet, the desert world of Tatooine.\n\nIt is on this wasteland that the droids encounter young farmer Luke Skywalker, who quickly learns of Leia's plight. Suffering at the hands of the Empire himself, Luke is spurred into action to rescue the princess. Aided by Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca, and the droids, Luke and the team embark on their mission, unaware that they may just be the new hope the galaxy has been waiting for.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
