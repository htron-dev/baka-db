## Sinopse

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away….

The Empire strikes back! Despite the loss of the Death Star, the Galactic Empire's fleet has been on the move to squash the Rebel Alliance. The Rebellion has since had to move their operations to the distant snow-planet Hoth, where they lay hidden from the ever-encroaching Empire.

After a near-fatal accident, Luke Skywalker receives a vision from his late master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who tells him to seek out a Jedi master known as Yoda in the Dagobah system. Meanwhile, Princess Leia Organa and smuggler-turned-rebel Han Solo grapple with their budding feelings for one another, which only grow more sensitive when Han decides he must leave to settle his debt with the gangster Jabba the Hutt.

As the fight between the Rebellion and the Empire continues, the trio find themselves facing their toughest challenges yet. As Luke is determined to train under the reluctant Yoda, Han and Leia find themselves relentlessly pursued by Darth Vader's armada. Meanwhile, the Emperor has now taken notice of Luke's budding powers, and sets in motion a cruel plot to turn him to the Empire's side...
