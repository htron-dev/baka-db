## Sinopse

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

Returning to his homeworld of Tatooine, Jedi knight Luke Skywalker prepares to free his friend Han Solo, who lies in the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt. With the aid of Leia Organa, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, Luke launches his carefully planned rescue mission.

Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance has received troubling news: the Galactic Empire is constructing a new, more powerful Death Star. What's more, Darth Vader and his master, the Emperor himself, are overseeing its construction. However, the Rebellion has also received plans on how they can attack this stationâ€”by traveling to the forest moon of Endor, where they can disrupt the Death Star's shields and launch a surprise attack to destroy it.

As the saga comes to an end, the rebels embark on their last do-or-die mission. For Luke, this means confronting his father, Darth Vader, and combating the dark side of the Force once more. With the end of the war ahead of them, the Empire and Rebellion begin their final battle, one that will decide the fate of the galaxy.
