    "sinopse": "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\n\nDue to the efforts of a sinister phantom menace, a recent chain of events threatens to plunge the galaxy into turmoil. The Trade Federation, interested only in the pursuit of greed, has blockaded the Republic planet Naboo, ostensibly in protest of the Galactic Republic's high taxation on trade routes. In response, the supreme chancellor of the Republic secretly dispatches two Jedi knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, to negotiate with the Federation as ambassadors. However, the negotiations are cut short when the Federation ambushes the Jedi and invades Naboo.\n\nSurviving the attack and escaping to Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan rescue its captive monarch, Padmé Amidala. Aiming to bring her to the Republic to plead for help, the Jedi flee with her from Naboo. However, when their ship is damaged in their escape, they're forced to land on the outlying desert planet of Tatooine. Now, in order to repair their ship, the group must lay their hopes on a local boy named Anakin Skywalker, a boy within whom Qui-Gon senses more than just a clever mind, and whose historic legend is about to begin.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
