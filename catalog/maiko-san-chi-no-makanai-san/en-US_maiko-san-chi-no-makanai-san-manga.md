## Sinopse

Kyoto is home to many districts where young women work as geisha: entertainers who perform traditional songs and dance. Kiyo Nozuki is a teenager living in a small manor where a group of maiko—apprentice geisha—reside. She has always admired the geisha and originally moved to Kyoto in hopes of becoming a maiko. However, Kiyo discovers that she is not cut out for the job. Not letting it upset her too much, she decides to help her troupe using her strongest suit instead—become a caterer and cook them delicious meals to support them in their everyday lives!
