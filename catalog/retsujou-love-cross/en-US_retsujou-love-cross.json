    "sinopse": "It's Leo's first trip to a hot springs resort with a boyfriend, and although he wants to P.D.A. all over the place, his boyfriend only cares about what other people will think. As a result, Leo is completely turned off. Who could blame him when he then starts eyeing up a good-looking guy while they're out for a walk? Leo's boyfriend doesn't even want to cuddle in the privacy of their own room, so Leo leaves and fate steps in! As he's enjoying the hot spring, he meets the handsome guy, Ryota. Leo makes a move on Ryota, who seems to be into him, too! Are they going to...? Right there...!? Just as Leo starts getting his hopes up, Ryota only smiles and gets out of the hot spring, leaving Leo high and dry! Ryota seems like a nice guy, but turns out to be a real tease!! However, neither man can turn down a hot opportunity... It was supposed to be one night only, but then the unbelievable happens! Where will this relationship between two players lead??\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
