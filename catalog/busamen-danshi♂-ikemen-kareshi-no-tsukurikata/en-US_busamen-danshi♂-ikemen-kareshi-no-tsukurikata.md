## Sinopse

Ayamu, Haiyato (blond) and Ryuuji (blue hair) are all childhood friends. Everyone thinks of Haiyato and Ryuuji as the good looking ones, which makes Ayamu nervous that he might not fit in with them anymore. One day, Ayamu hears a rumor that Haiyato and Ryuuji might be a couple!? When seeing them together, he decides to tell them that it doesn't matter if they are a couple or not but that he would still like to continue to be friends with them.

They look at him in surprise and tell him that he must be mistaken. Because the one that they both are madly in love with has always been and will always be Ayamu! Ayamu is confused by all this but they still ask him to choose someone if he was interested. But Ayamu couldn't choose between his two best friends!

So, what do these guys do? They figure that neither of them have been rejected so they start their "love attack"! And now Ayamu has agreed to date both of them! Also, Haiyato and Ryuuji are more worried that someone might steal their cute Ayamu away from them!
