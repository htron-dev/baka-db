    "sinopse": "On his previous trip to India, aging but irrepressible manga author Yukichi Yamamatsu overcame illness, pickpockets, and a formidable language barrier to successfully publish the first-ever translation of a Japanese comic into Hindi. Now he's back—running an udon noodle cart in the Delhi slums, hanging out with drug dealers, performing standup comedy in the park, and trying his best to fit in with the locals in rural Purvanchal.",
