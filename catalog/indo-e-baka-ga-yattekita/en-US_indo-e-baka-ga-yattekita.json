As he attempts to navigate his way as a stranger in a strange land, hilarity ensues.\n\nAs he slowly recovers from the culture shock that he was highly unprepared for, he gets back on track to focus on his original mission. His problems seem never-ending as he struggles to find a translator for his books, deal with a printing press, and find a vendor for the printed comics.",
