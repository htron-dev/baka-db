## Sinopse

All the stories intertwine and are best read in sequence.

1,4) High-school student and tattoo artist Tohru is holding a secret love for his friend. So when he's confessed to by his junior he turns the boy down flat. But Katsumi isn't one to give up easily.

2,5) Former students and current sensei's Kikawa and Meguro had a relationship as children. But that was all over years ago, right? So why can't Kikawa stop thinking about Meguro?

3,6) Student Katahana can't help but wonder why his close friend Tohmune always wears an undershirt. What exactly is he trying to hide underneath his clothes?

7-9) Since he met Katsumi, Tohru feels he been acting strangely. He can't seem to concentrate on anything, even his tattoos. And the tangled relationships between artists and their subjects seem keep coming between them.
