## Sinopse

A collaboration between My Tear CL an eyedrops company for their new product "Ice Crash", and Uchiage Hanabi, Shita kara Miru ka? Yoko kara Miru ka?. The campaign produced 1 TV commercial and 2 web-exclusive commercials as well as various tie-in goods. But the new footage created for the campaign was identical between all three releases, with the rest of the footage being from the feature film besides the difference in narration. As such, MAL will reflect this campaign as a single episode entry as there was no change new anime content among the three releases.
