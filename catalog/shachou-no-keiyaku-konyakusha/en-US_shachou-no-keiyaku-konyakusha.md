## Sinopse

Will blackmail keep them together or separate them forever?

Fiancée wanted; no love necessary is the perfect job for Tara Palmer. For commitment-phobe Cole Charteris, the word marriage isn't in his vocabulary until he meets Tara, the woman who answers an advertisement to pose as his fiancée. But playing a loving couple when there's no love, only blackmail doesn't make for love everlasting.
