## Sinopse

It's about the life a boy who loves this super hero female character from a show(the one in the picture above) and dreams about her all the time. One day when he starts school(not sure what grade, guessing elementary or highschool) when he suddenly meets a childhood friend after years had passed. She really likes him, but he seems to be stuck on that super hero female character.
