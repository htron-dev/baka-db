    "sinopse": "When Kaya runs into trouble one day, it’s not a knight in shining armor, but her stuffed animals that come to her rescue. It may sound crazy, but Kaya isn’t pretending: she loves her stuffed animals so much, they come to life and turn into people! Plushies come in all different shapes and sizes, and so do their hearts—whereas some are nice, there are others who are not so kind.\n\n(Source: Broccoli Books)",
