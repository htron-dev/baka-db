## Sinopse

The calm, composed and shrewd restaurant owner, Hatakeyama, is in love with Yamasaki, the cool, beautiful chef from a rival restaurant. In the past, Hatakeyama tried to embrace him and Yamasaki hates him for it. Despite this, Hatakeyama refuses to give up and aims to start again as friends. Although Hatakeyama often asks him out to eat, Yamasaki still doesn't show any interest in him... but what happens when a cool, good-looking fellow chef appears?
