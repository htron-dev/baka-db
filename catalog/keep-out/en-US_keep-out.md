## Sinopse

Fuyuki is an anti-terrorism specialist for a security company. His current assignment is as a bodyguard for elite company president Kagami. This is no ordinary assignment, however. Kagami’s not looking for protection from Fuyuki, he’s looking for love, and his constant expressions of affection have Kagami’s nerves stretched to the breaking point.
