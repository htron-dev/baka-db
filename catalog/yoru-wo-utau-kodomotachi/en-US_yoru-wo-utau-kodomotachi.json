This time the mising person is Kuniyuki’s best friend - Kashiwagi. Are the rumors really true? Kuniyuki is angry and has no idea what to do about his friend, when he meets a strange, but very pretty girl called Towa. She says she is the guardian of the “outcasts,” those who were taken to the “mansion,” but what does that really mean...?!\n\n(Source: Aerandria)",
