    "sinopse": "The 4-koma series is about a young girl named Wakaba Kohashi, who has an elegant air befitting her given name, meaning \"fresh leaves.\" Despite her looks, Wakaba is fascinated by the gyaru subculture, a label applied to fashion-conscious young women who typically have bleached hair, tanned skin, and heavy make-up. This story follows the daily life of Wakaba and her friends, and the time that they spend together.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
