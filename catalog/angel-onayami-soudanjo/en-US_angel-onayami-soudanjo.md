## Sinopse

The rumour has it, if you sit on a particular bench in the park and repeat 'Dear Angel, please help me...' three times, one will in fact descend to your help. All's good, except this angel's appearance will be that of a boorish middle-aged man and the only thing he'll do for you—is listen to your worries and, in some rare cases, give you a little push.
