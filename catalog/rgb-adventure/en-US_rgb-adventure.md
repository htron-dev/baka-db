## Sinopse

The light – it is the resource of life. There are mysterious monsters and robots that aim at the powers of the light, i.e. R(Red), G(Green), and B(Blue). However, no one notices that… except three children.

Ryu - he is a stupid, simple, and mischievous boy who he says without hesitation that his dream is to the conqueror of the world.
Guccho - he is a nerd of mechanics, glutton, and chicken-hearted.
Becky - she is very cute, but she has a very twisted personality.

They have encouraging friends, such as Rosso, Gibson, Bo, etc. They are various aliens that usually change their figures into animals. By exchanges between aliens who have different principles, purposes, tastes, and hobbies, they will learn importance of communications.
