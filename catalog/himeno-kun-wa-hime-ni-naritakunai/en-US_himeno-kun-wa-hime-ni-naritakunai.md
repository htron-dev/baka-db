## Sinopse

Himeno-kun has become the princess of his boys' school because of his face and the surname "Himeno." Just when he was thinking of how to get rid of this position, Yurine Himekawa, a transfer student with a feminine face and an elegant aura appeared! Himeno tries to push his "princess" title to him, but...? A story that's more than just friendship, but not quite BL?!
