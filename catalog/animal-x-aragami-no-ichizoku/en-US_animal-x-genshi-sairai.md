## Sinopse

The third series in the "Animal X" timeline.

Having burned enough bridges in Japan, Yuuji and Minato have moved their new family to a small dinosaur-crazy town in Canada. If there's any place in the world left for Dinosauroids, surely it must be here: a town revived by the discovery of dinosaur bones, with one of the largest paleontology research centers in the world, and a network of "Conservation Centers" set up to cater to the newly-discovered Dinosauroid community. The rest of the world, None-the-wiser for the incident at the Biodome (which was covered up completely) has pretty much forgotten all about Dinosauroids.
