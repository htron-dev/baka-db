## Sinopse

The second series in the Animal X timeline.

Taking refuge in the newly rebuilt Asato-Jima commune, Yuuji and Minato try to carve a place for themselves in a Dinosauroid society foreign to both of them. Split up for long periods of time by their work assignments, Minato and Yuuji slowly grow farther apart. When it seems as if nothing can possibly get any worse: Yuuji gives birth to his first child.
