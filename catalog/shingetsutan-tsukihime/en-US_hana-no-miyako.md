## Sinopse

Hana no Miyako is a Tsukihime and Melty Blood spin-off about Shiki Toono's cousin, Miyako Arima.

Shiki Nanaya is really troubled now. As the weakest member of the Aikido club, she was charged to recruit one more member. Unfortunately, her potential prey, Miyako Arima, is uninterested in joining. A chance encounter put her in the crosshaired sights of various weirdos in the school, just to flavor her life a bit more. What is she supposed to do?
