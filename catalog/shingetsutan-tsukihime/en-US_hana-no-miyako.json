As the weakest member of the Aikido club, she was charged to recruit one more member. Unfortunately, her potential prey, Miyako Arima, is uninterested in joining. A chance encounter put her in the crosshaired sights of various weirdos in the school, just to flavor her life a bit more. What is she supposed to do?\n\n(Source: MU)",
