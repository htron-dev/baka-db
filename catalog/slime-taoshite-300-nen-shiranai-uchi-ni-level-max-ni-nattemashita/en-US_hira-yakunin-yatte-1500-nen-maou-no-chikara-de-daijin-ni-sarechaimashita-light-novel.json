    "sinopse": "A devil's work is never done!\n\nBeelzebub is a demon of many roles—minister of agriculture, Azusa's \"big sister\" and the demon king's closest confidant. Before her illustrious rise to power, though, she was just a low-ranking pencil pusher in the government with no ambitions, no dreams, and no adventure in her life. Then, on a whim of the newly coronated demon king, she received the biggest and most terrifying promotion imaginable! How will Beelzebub handle the sudden responsibilities of the entire Ministry of Agriculture?!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
