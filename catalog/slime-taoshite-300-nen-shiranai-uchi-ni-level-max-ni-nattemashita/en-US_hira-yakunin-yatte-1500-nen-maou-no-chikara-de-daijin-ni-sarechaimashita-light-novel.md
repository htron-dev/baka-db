## Sinopse

A devil's work is never done!

Beelzebub is a demon of many roles—minister of agriculture, Azusa's "big sister" and the demon king's closest confidant. Before her illustrious rise to power, though, she was just a low-ranking pencil pusher in the government with no ambitions, no dreams, and no adventure in her life. Then, on a whim of the newly coronated demon king, she received the biggest and most terrifying promotion imaginable! How will Beelzebub handle the sudden responsibilities of the entire Ministry of Agriculture?!
