    "sinopse": "Sun-hyuk's grandfather has passed away, and now he's left with tons of money that he should be able to spend. But there's a catch to this will. He inherits the money, but also a housekeeper, a housekeeper-in-training, a lawyer (former bum), a distant relative, and even a girl he doesn't even know!\n\nThis girl, Jae-young, is the start of all of his bad luck. First, Sun-hyuk's nametag and his car keys get stolen. Now, he's about to be charged for driving as an unlicensed minor and for bribery. How is he going to get out of this mess? Will his grandfather help him from heaven?\n\n(Source: DramaQueen)",
