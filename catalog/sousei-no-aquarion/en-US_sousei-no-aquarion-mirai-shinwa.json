This awakened The Wings of the Fallen Angel Clan, which preys for humans and reduced the population of the world to a mere 2 billion inhabitants. They’re not hurt by human weaponry. The only things that are able to combat The Wings of the Fallen Angel Clan are the man-shaped soldiers - Aquarion. And now, Kamishiro, a young man with mysterious \"Elemental Powers\" stood up to oppose The Wings of the Fallen Angel Clan. Do lives of billions of people on Earth rest in the hands of one person?\n\n(Source: MU)",
