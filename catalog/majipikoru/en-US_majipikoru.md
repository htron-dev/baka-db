## Sinopse

Yuma is a girl in love! Quite typical you say, but you see, Yuma is also a mage and mages in this world have to be rather discreet. Her boyfriend to be, Kaname, is a bright, handsome, kind young man... who is allergic to magic.

If things couldn't get worse for poor Yuma, the Underground Empire is about to declare war on every mage in the world! What's a girl to do?
