## Sinopse

Tsugumi Rinko can’t wait to escape the tedium of high school for the challenges and rewards that accompany life at a fine arts college. She only has two problems: she has few social skills and fewer friends, and with less than nine months remaining before her crucial admissions test, she has no practical art experience.
