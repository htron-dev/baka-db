## Sinopse

The Demon Neuro has a raging hunger for "enigmas." Being dissatisfied with his current regime in hell, he's come into the mortal realm in order to satiate his ever-growing appetite. The murder case of a young girl's father seems to be sufficiently enticing for the Demon's needs... But what else might happen between these two?
