She is a childhood friend of Ryou, but they hardly spoke to each other from junior high school to senior high school, but one thing leads them to talk to each other again. After that, Hina takes care of Ryou and acts aggressively, but Ryou doesn't really understand the meaning of her actions.\n\n(Source: MU)",
