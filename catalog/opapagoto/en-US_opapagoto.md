## Sinopse

The importance of "family" is being forgotten. At an all-girls school, a program to simulate and nurture family ties is carried out. Each student plays the role of father, mother, or child at random. Ayagasaki Kasuga is a girl who has been assigned the role of father in this outrageous project.
