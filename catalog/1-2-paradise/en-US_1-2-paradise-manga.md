## Sinopse

Yusuke has been afraid of women since childhood. His problems are compounded when the very twins who caused his phobia come to live with him. Both girls have been in love with him since their first encounter, in which he saved them from a vicious stray dog. Because of his phobia, their affections are little better for him now than they were when he was little. His days of suffering have returned.
