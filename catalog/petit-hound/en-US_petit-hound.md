## Sinopse

There are some days when it'd be better to just stay in bed... so says Kazuma, an apprentice demon-hunter, on the day when he finds a strange creature in the forest. It's not a bloodthirsty monster, but a young half-human, half-dog girl. Just what type of creature is she? And why does Kazuma sees her at his school right after escaping from the encounter?
