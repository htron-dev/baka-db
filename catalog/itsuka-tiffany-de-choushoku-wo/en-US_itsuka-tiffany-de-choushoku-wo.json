    "sinopse": "The manga follows Mariko and her friends as they go to different restaurants for breakfast. Mariko is a 28-year-old woman living in Tokyo with her boyfriend of seven years. Mariko becomes disillusioned with her slovenly boyfriend's lifestyle and breaks up with him to get a new start. She fondly remembers the wonderful breakfasts she had in her family growing up, and she decides to start a new lifestyle by visiting different (real-life) places for breakfast every morning. The places she visits range from Good Morning Café to the small Japanese-style restaurant Katō in Tsukiji Fish Market, to bakeries like Le Pain Quotidien.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
