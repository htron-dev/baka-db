    "sinopse": "Near future. A world renowned mathematician/physicist Francis Dullam loses his left brain hemisphere and retires from the hard science to study dolphins. Several years later he comes up with the new thesis (which is essentially a collection of dolphin footage). As the \"thesis\" is being severly criticized by the media, Ishii Mitsunari (a student living in America) discovers the idea hidden there, that will help to create the true Artifical Intelligence. Motivated to create the AI first, Mitsunari leaves for Okinawa, to follow the footsteps of Dullam.\n\n(Source: MU)",
