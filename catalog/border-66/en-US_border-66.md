## Sinopse

The earth is strange. Everyone thought so. Disasters that are intensifying year after year. Heat waves, heavy rains, large typhoons...

Researcher Tsukimura Yutaka promotes geoengineering to stop global warming. On the other hand, his twins, Ryo and Iko, were supposed to live a normal life with her pregnant mother Yuko.

Antarctic earthquake and rising sea levels... This is the story of two twins fighting against a collapsing earth.
