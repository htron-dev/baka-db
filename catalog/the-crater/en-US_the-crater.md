## Sinopse

"The Crater" is a series of short complete stories ranging in genre from suspense to mystery and horror. In the second episode entitled "The Octagonal Mansion," a boy who is undecided over what to do with his life happens to go to an octagonal mansion, where he can start his life all over again. The 8th episode, "The Bell Rings" features three people who are haunted by tinkling bells that won't let them forget their past sins. Some stories end happily, while others don't. But all of them have the unforgettable imagery typical of Tezuka Osamu's short stories.
