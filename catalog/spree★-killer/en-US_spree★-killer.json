    "sinopse": "Who the hell needs dying!\n\nThose who have committed crimes in this world shall move on to Gehenna in the next. And there, in the nether depths of Hell the band SPREE★KILLER, all dressed in black, indulge in fame and unrivalled popularity, having won the favour of the King of Hell himself, Mephisto!\n\nBut the time has come for young guitarist Alex to lead the band back from the abyss, up towards the surface, towards Chaos! They rise in revenge against the abhorrent world which has rejected its own self!\n\nAnd now the maddening melodies of the sorrowful revenants echo throughout!\n\n(Source: Amilova)",
