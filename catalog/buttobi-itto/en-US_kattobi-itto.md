## Sinopse

Itto and Yara are childhood rivals. Itto is small and quarrelsome while Yara is big and vindictive. Itto has been holding a grudge against Yara for a long time from the scar Yara made him five years ago during a fight… After years of travelling with his father, Itto finally returns to Japan only to reunite with a childhood rival, Yara. A very hilarious combination of circumstances will bring the unpredictable Itto to join Yara's soccer team… The manga follows this wacky duo as they, alongside the rest of the team, 'battle' other HS teams on the road to becoming Japan 's best. The intense footy goodness is only second to the ridiculously hilarious situations that Itto somehow manages to find himself in.
