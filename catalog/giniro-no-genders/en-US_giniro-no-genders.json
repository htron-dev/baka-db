    "sinopse": "Three months after starting college, Gin Fujigaya is still having trouble meeting new people and fitting in. As an escape, Gin secretly indulges in cross-dressing and posting selfies of himself online, which has garnered him a large number of followers. This leads him to going outside dressed as a girl for the first time, and he soon discovers that the way people interact with him like this is vastly different than what he's used to. Over time, Gin's fondness for cross-dressing and looking cute allows him to meet others who are harboring their own secrets.\n\n(Source: MU, edited)",
