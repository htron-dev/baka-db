## Sinopse

Tezuka Ringo has moved to a new school because he didn't want to be apart from his best friend Kei. However, things don't go as Ringo had planned. He ends up sharing a room with Kurosaki Riku (a very attractive young man a grade above Ringo) and things then go downhill for him. Sure, Ringo didn't mind when he first saw Riku (because of how pretty he looked), but things start to heat up once Riku starts making not-so-subtle passes at him; also including him sneaking into Ringo's bed and touching him. Ah, young romance.

Contains oneshot called Ren Chaku.
