    "sinopse": "Western VRMMO DEMONDAL was known for its extremely harsh game system. To begin with, there were no levels. There were no skills. There were no guilds. There was no inventory. There were no convenient system messages or maps of any kind either. It was so needlessly realistic that it was already basically a VR life simulator.\n\nAs for anything game-like, it was basically limited to weapon masteries; a proficiency level that you got from using your weapon, as well as physical strength that increased as well. That was it.\n\nIt was a fantasy game so there was magic, but forming a contract with a spirit was extremely difficult, and only 1% of the playerbase were magicians.\n\nIn this VR game DEMONDAL that was ridiculously close to reality, the protagonist Kei who was a well known mounted archery expert, was one day sent to another world with his Russian DEMONDAL friend.\n\nThe game that was severe to begin with had turned into a reality, and the harshness increased again――\n\n(Source: Oniichanyamete)",
