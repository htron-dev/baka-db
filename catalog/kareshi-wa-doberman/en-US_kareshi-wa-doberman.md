## Sinopse

“My cute Kuro, I’m sorry, but I have to go somewhere far away, however, if you are obedient, I will come back soon. So, please, look after this house. I love you, Kuro!”

Hitomi gave this promise to her beloved dog, Kuro; however, this story continues a hundred years after this. Mitsuko’s parents are divorced, and her mother did not come to pick her up, therefore, her charming teacher becomes her guardian. Then, one day, Mitsuko and her friends decide to go for an excursion to a rumored haunted old mansion, and then, a black dog suddenly attacks them ferociously.

Just when she thought the dog was going to bite her, the dog cuddles around her and brings her to a portrait of a lady, who resembles her! Then, the dog transforms into a naked, hot dude and embraces her…! What will happen to Mitsuko?

Will her heart be melted by the loyal and handsome, Kuro? Or, will she be saved by her reliable teacher?
