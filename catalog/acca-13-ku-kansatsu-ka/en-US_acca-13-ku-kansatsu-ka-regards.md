## Sinopse

Set in the capital city of Badon one year after the events of the TV anime, Jean and the rest of the ACCA department are preparing for the one-year anniversary of the establishment of the new order. For the characters — caught between rumors of unrest, unchanging days, new crossroads, gazes remembered in memories, and days of new beginnings — time once again begins to move forward.
