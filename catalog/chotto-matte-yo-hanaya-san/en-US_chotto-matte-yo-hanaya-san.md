## Sinopse

Sho Kamikura is an upbeat high school student who is suddenly faced with some bad luck. To add insult to injury, he has an accident and finds himself lying stunned in the street. Florist Tokio Handa steps out of his shop and kindly offers him a helping hand, but things turn a little awkward when Sho realizes this seemingly sweet florist may only be after his body!?
