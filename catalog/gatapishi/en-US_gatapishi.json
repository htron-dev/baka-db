    "sinopse": "Kosuke Ano transferred to a new high school, and everything is new and exciting... or maybe he's just loud and oblivious to his surroundings. He didn't even know the school he entered was built by the temple nearby. Tomoyuki Zuisen, on the other hand, son of a monk, has been raised in the temple but susceptible to severe mood swings. Regardless, he guides the clueless Ano through the basics of monk disciplines like the practice of meditation, Zazen. Kosuke, although enthusiastic and full of energy, ends up falling asleep during Zazen. Will Ano be able to prove to Zuisen that he is not just noisy and easily elated? Or will Zuisen be quicker to suppress Ano's spirit?\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
