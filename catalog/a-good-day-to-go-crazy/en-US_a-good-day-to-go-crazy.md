Hosoo's uneventful days are spent caring for his sick younger sister, when TV star and singer Esau enters his life. The dazzling celeb had been laying low because a woman claiming to be his birth mother suddenly appeared. Behind Esau's stardom is a pain hidden away, and Hosoo is the only one he finds comfort in. Hosoo's life is anything but ordinary now, but is newfound love enough to drive Esau to a proper comeback?
