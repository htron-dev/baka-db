## Sinopse

Between the short stories (included in the compilation), Quartet Game is the longest and, probably, the most enjoyable. A quartet in a music school will discover by pure chance a hidden partiture, thought when they investigate about it they will end up finding out that not only is the partiture what matters and that music can make some people arrive to the extremes of murdering. This story is a mistery-like kind of, but with the special touch of Yoshizumi, which makes it a cult work. Is the story that gives the compilation volume its title. The other two stories are "Heart Beat" and "Another Day."
