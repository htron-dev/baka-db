## Sinopse

The moment you fall in love, should that be considered as real love? I mean, all it is, really, is self satisfaction, isn't it? You aren't thinking about the other person's happiness, but rather, all you're thinking about is, "As long as I feel good, it's fine."

To purge that sort of love, Thales plans to interfere between couples as much as possible, and then sever their ties.
