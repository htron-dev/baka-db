## Sinopse

This is a science fiction story in which a boy with supernatural powers, Sharaku Housuke, probes into circumstances surrounding events in history. He is also a descendant of the "three-eyed tribe." A second-year student in junior high school, Sharaku Housuke never goes without a large bandage on his forehead. He is an innocent boy, like a little child. But once the bandage comes off, his third eye appears and he suddenly turns into a devil-like being, displaying horrifying psychic power.
