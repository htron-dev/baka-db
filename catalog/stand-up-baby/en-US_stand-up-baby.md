## Sinopse

Takumi and Kishou are childhood friends. Both are in the archery club. But then, Takumi gets injured. Because he can't do archery anymore, he becomes the archery club manager.

For years, Kishou has liked Takumi as more than a friend. But he's afraid that Takumi won't accept that, so he tries to break up their friendship...?!
