After a certain incident, he ended up instructing a senior student from his high school, the beautiful Mikoto Chihiro, on the basics of adventuring! After that, Chihiro, who was usually cool and difficult to approach, started to show her true bright personality only to Kazaya!?

"I did it! I did it, Tsugami-kun! I was able to slay it!"

"S-Senpai, don't you think your personality has changed a little too much!?"
