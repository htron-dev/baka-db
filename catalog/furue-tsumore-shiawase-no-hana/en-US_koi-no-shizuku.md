3. The Distance That Your Voice Touches
   Miyakawa's upstairs neighbor Tsukasa is always dropping things onto his balcony, and of course Miyakawa has to return them, only to be fed dinner and sexually harassed! It's getting to be too much for the poor college student.

4. I Want to Embrace
   High school student Takase is unwittingly drawn to cheerful energetic Sora. But as his interest and naturally protective feelings toward his friend become something deeper and more dangerous, Takase begins to pull away from Sora.

5. Shake
   Kikisui is a waiter in a cafe with primarily female clientele, but lately a handsome man in a black suit has been coming around. Miyamamo has no sense of personal space and a crush on Kikisui.
