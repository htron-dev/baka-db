## Sinopse

"What the hell are you doing, me?"

Already half of his high school life is over and none of his hopes and dreams have been fulfilled yet. This is how Yuuhi Nagi, who has no friends in his classes, has been living his uneventful empty life—until he got dragged into this unexpected crisis!

This is how the lives of the four people who are most likely to repeat a year, and the person who will help them succeed, are connected.

This is where this bittersweet coming of age story begins!!
