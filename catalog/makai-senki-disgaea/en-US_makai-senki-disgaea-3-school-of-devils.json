    "sinopse": "The Netherworld, a world spoiled by spite, cruelty, blood-soaked taboos, and boundless riffraff. They say that dark dwellers run rampant, causing horrifying disasters in these lands. In the center of this Netherworld lies a school that endlessly continues to expand its grounds -- Nether Institute, Evil Academy.\n\nWith the Overlord as dean and greater demons for teachers, demon students who follow their baser instincts are labeled as honor students at this school of torment.\n\nMao, the Overlord's son, in order to defeat his father, decided to have the power of a hero. Involving the delinquent Raspberry and her sidekicks together with the 'hero' Almaz, another chaos started in the darkness of the Netherworld!\n\n(Source: MU)",
