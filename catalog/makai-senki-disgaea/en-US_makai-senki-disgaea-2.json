    "sinopse": "Adell is the lone human being in a world of humans-turned-demons, made by Overlord Zenon. It's Adell's task—and burden—to defeat Zenon and restore his friends and family to their normal selves.\n\nBut summoning an Overlord is not easy.\n\nWhen Adell tries to call Zenon, he ends up with his daughter, Rozalin. Now, bound by contract, Adell promises to take Rozalin back to her father.\n\nHowever, it will take much more than blind courage to defeat her all-powerful father and save the world.\n\n(Source: Broccoli Books)",
