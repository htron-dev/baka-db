There is an island where both Japan and Korea unload their most dangerous and violent criminals. It's said that the island has become hell on earth, and anyone left alive there have become demons. The latest drop-off at the island is a very strong, very violent murderer. Will he be able to overcome whatever he might find on this hell island?
