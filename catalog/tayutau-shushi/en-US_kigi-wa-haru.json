    "sinopse": "Yuuki Yugi is a college student with looks that make girls swoon and hand him their contact information. People envy Yuuki for being attractive and assume he is a playboy, with girls falling for him left and right. But the truth is, Yuuki does not want to be with girls the way they want to be with him. But is he gay? The only way he can confirm or deny that for himself is to try being with a man.\n\nWith mixed feelings, insecurities, and doubts from a difficult childhood, Yuuki approaches Yu Koba, a regular at the restaurant Yuuki works for, to answer his questions. Little does he know that Koba has his past to face, much like Yuuki himself.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
