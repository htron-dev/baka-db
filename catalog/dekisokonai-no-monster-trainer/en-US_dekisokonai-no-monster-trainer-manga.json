Reyn Erhardt, a slime trainer, the lowest of the low, cares nothing for status and just continues his daily training regimen together with his personal slime, Pem-Pem.\n\nIn a school dominated by monsters as powerful as dragons, those who cannot hope to rise to the top take their frustrations out on the weak, and Reyn and Pem-Pem make for easy targets...?\n\n(Source: MU)",
