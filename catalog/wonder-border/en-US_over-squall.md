## Sinopse

Brooding alone in a nearby park, Natsurou's only companions were his regrets and painful memories of love... until a voice rang out to rouse him from his trance. The owner of the voice was the stranger Tsuyuhiko—a boy who bore a striking resemblance to his former lover. The intriguing youth took pity on the forlorn Natsurou, and he found himself responding to Tsuyuhiko's coaxing without a fight. Following him home, Natsurou allowed himself to be swept up and drowned in pleasure, taking the stranger's offer to use him as a substitute and embrace him as if he was his former lover. Though their tryst was only meant to be for a single night, Tsuyuhiko gave him an innocent smile and made a promise to meet again—Natsurou realized something changed inside him. However, it appears his young paramour has some worrisome tendencies... A heartbroken civil servant and a soft boy with troubling propensities. This "how to love" romance will slowly teach them about love and affection.
