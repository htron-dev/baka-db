But usually, I am just a dull man who was in love with my childhood friend, Kanade, a very cool guy who always saved me from the bullies! Unfortunately, it seems like he does not remember me anymore... But I won't give up! By covering my identity and becoming a cool man, I will make Kanade share a house together with me!\n\n(Source: Torico)",
