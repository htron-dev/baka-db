## Sinopse

Third-year middle-school student Anna is now living with a crude and disorganized fourth-year college student, Ema, who is always manipulating her. After what used to be uneventful days, Anna finds herself caught in the middle of Ema's complicated romantic relationship, crossing the line into the world of adults—a world where one sees women kissing each other.
