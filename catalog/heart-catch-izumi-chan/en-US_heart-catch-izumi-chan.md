## Sinopse

Harada Izumi has just transferred to a new high school and is doing her best to fit in, which isn’t easy when you have a secret as big as hers—that she can read minds! And it doesn’t help when she is seated next to Akechi Kikumaru, a handsome young man she immediately takes an interest in who is more than a little bit of a pervert!
