    "sinopse": "Taiji's normal body temperature is 38 degrees Celsius, or so he says, but Shiina thinks he's full of it. Taiji is a friend with whom Shiina can always--and does always--fight... Until Taiji unexpectedly confesses his love! Shiina begins to run a fever, but is that the only reason she's getting so hot...?\nBut that's just the first story.\n\nThe second it called \"Solution Maze\" and has a more serious feel to it.\n\nNext is \"Heaven In Jail\" which is about a girl who's photo somehow ended up in a questionable magazine. Which is then found and used to blackmail her into doing homework and the like.\n\nThe third is \"Winter's Aquarius\" which is about a girl taking swimming lessons and it's more comedy then romance.\n\nAnd there is a random bit at the end about pets.",
