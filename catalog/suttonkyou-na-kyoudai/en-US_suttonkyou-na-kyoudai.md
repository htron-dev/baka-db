## Sinopse

Ueda Aki is about to start her first year in high school with older brothers Tooru and Kaoru, who are stars of the tennis team as well as seemingly the rest of the school. Aki has always gotten along very well with Tooru, but never with Kaoru. Despite the new environment, none of this seems likely to change until...??

Note: Vol. 3 also contains a one-shot titled "Jingle White" about Christmas time during a very volatile relationship between Kazuyoshi and Yuka.
