    "sinopse": "Shizuku Ishiai uses dance as a form of self-expression, and she feels it is when she can truly be herself. Adapting the pseudonym \"Ai Shizukuishi,\" the middle school student uploads videos of herself dancing to a website called \"Smile Douga.\" To conceal her identity, Ai dresses a boy.\n\nAfter gaining popularity online, Ai decides to further her passion by attending a dance audition. It is here that she catches the attention of \"dance prince\" Kazanami Hayate, a well-known male dancer who is initially oblivious to the fact that Ai is a girl. The two end up in an idol group called \"Buddyz\" and participate in an all-male dance competition, but amidst their rivalry, Hayate discovers Ai's secret. To make matters more complicated, he begins to develop romantic feelings for her!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
