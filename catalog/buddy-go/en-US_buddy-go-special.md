## Sinopse

Shizuku Ishiai uses dance as a form of self-expression, and she feels it is when she can truly be herself. Adapting the pseudonym "Ai Shizukuishi," the middle school student uploads videos of herself dancing to a website called "Smile Douga." To conceal her identity, Ai dresses a boy.

After gaining popularity online, Ai decides to further her passion by attending a dance audition. It is here that she catches the attention of "dance prince" Kazanami Hayate, a well-known male dancer who is initially oblivious to the fact that Ai is a girl. The two end up in an idol group called "Buddyz" and participate in an all-male dance competition, but amidst their rivalry, Hayate discovers Ai's secret. To make matters more complicated, he begins to develop romantic feelings for her!
