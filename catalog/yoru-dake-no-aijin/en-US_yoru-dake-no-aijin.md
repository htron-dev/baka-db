## Sinopse

Gwen Sawyer, a popular decorum instructor among upper-class girls, is hired to be a live-in tutor to the daughter of the distinguished Harrison family. The family is headed by Will Harrison, who is the CEO of HarCorp...and Dallas's most eligible bachelor. However, on their first meeting, Gwen finds him to be an arrogant man who thinks money can solve everything and who only sees women as things. Gwen is determined to teach him some manners, too, but she has no idea what a dangerous man she is trying to deal with!
