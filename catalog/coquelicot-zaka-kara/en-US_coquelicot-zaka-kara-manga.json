    "sinopse": "The story is set in Showa 38 (1963, a year before the Tokyo Olympics) and follows the coming of age of an ordinary, pigtailed high school girl named Komatsuzaki in Yokohama, a harbor city near Tokyo. Her sailor father went missing after an accident, and her photographer mother is frequently going abroad for work. The manga recounts Komatsuzaki's everyday life of \"laughter and tears\" with a school newspaper member, the student council president, and other schoolmates.\n\n(Source: ANN)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Rudy no Tanjoubi, Bakubaku Kaban to Ai-chan",
