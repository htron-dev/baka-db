He avoids interacting with his classmates, and lives an utterly bland and colorless life. However, the cheerful and popular leader of the class, Hideto, calls out to him every single day. Yuugen ends up harboring feelings for this bright individual.\n\nHowever, one day, Hideto suddenly passes away. While still grappling with the reality of the situation, Yuugen discovers that the ghost of Hideto has appeared before him. Bound to this world by unfinished business, he enlists the help of Yuugen to help him pass on, but...\n\nA bittersweet love story of a boy overcoming grief and taking the steps into adulthood.\n\n(Source: Fusion Product, translated)",
