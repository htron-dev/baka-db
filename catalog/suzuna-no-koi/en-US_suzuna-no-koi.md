## Sinopse

Suzuna Osanai is a first-year student in high school. She's a little bit afraid of boys. When she meets one, she merely runs away at light speed, or trembles uncontrollably, or otherwise acts suspiciously. A romantic comedy progressing little by little, where things usually don't go as intended.
