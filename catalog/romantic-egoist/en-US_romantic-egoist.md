## Sinopse

All Arisa wanted was to go overseas for the summer, but instead she found herself roped into an Omiai with the heir to the Narimiya Corporation. She doesn't want to be involved in this and is trying to find a way out, but Narimiya has decided that he wants to marry her—and actually has the romantic skills and determination to win her heart!
