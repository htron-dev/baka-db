    "sinopse": "When she stands, she's like a white peony. When she sits, she's like a tree peony. When she walks, she's like a lily flower. And when you look her in the eyes, she's like the Great King of Terror. Despite having the qualities to be a peerless bishoujo, because of the look of her eyes and that atmosphere of hers, she's feared by others; such a girl is forcefully sent to another world. Being told by an Evil God that she would be granted a wish as a special favor, the girl made a wish──\n\n\"Make my eyes and atmosphere normal please.\"\n\nThis is a story recounting the lifestyle in a parallel world of a girl who would be perfect (probably) if just her one weak point was overcome.\n\nA fantasy comedy with magic, dungeons, and a hero and a demon king(candidate) who she gets tangled up with.\n\nShe's cursed though.\n\n(Source: Oniichanyamete)",
