## Sinopse

When she stands, she's like a white peony. When she sits, she's like a tree peony. When she walks, she's like a lily flower. And when you look her in the eyes, she's like the Great King of Terror. Despite having the qualities to be a peerless bishoujo, because of the look of her eyes and that atmosphere of hers, she's feared by others; such a girl is forcefully sent to another world. Being told by an Evil God that she would be granted a wish as a special favor, the girl made a wish──

"Make my eyes and atmosphere normal please."

This is a story recounting the lifestyle in a parallel world of a girl who would be perfect (probably) if just her one weak point was overcome.

A fantasy comedy with magic, dungeons, and a hero and a demon king(candidate) who she gets tangled up with.

She's cursed though.
