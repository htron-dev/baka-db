## Sinopse

Ninamori Tosa, drawn by mystery, left his sick bed to visit Hokage Island, owned by his friend Izumine Masatsugu. Tosa was later found dead. Now his twin siblings Kisa and Mei make their own trip to the desolate island. Their plan – to have Mei seduce the island’s owner while they both look for clues behind their brother’s death. But a fateful encounter at the island’s mansion prompts a slight change of plan…

Mourning Dinner Party is a tale of loss, lust, and love. Join the twins as they try to uncover what happened in Tosa’s last moments, as well as what lies behind Masatsugu’ isolated existence. What really caused Tosa’s death? What is this “curse”? And is Kisa falling for the man responsible?
