    "sinopse": "This 4-koma features a family of gamers! The youngest daughter, elementary schooler Aoi, is a fan of action, fighting, and racing games. She habitually makes lots of motions while playing, and sometimes even gets tangled in the cords. The older sister, middle schooler Makoto, likes role-playing games, tactics-style games, and simulations. She's something of a completist, and often stays up late gaming. Their mother, Yukie, is into massively multiplayer online games lately. Boys online often ask her what kind of panties she's wearing, but she takes it in stride. Their father, Seiji, is a university professor. However, he secretly plays dating-simulation time games in his study during the night. Their family runs into funny situations and trials that would only happen to a family of gamers!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
