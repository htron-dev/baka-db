    "sinopse": "Cactus Sam is just your regular, ordinary cowboy, but give him just a sip of milk and transforms from a calm, congenial fellow, into the rootin-est, tootin-est, two-gun shootin-est cowpoke you ever did see... And it just so happens his parents own the local \"Milk-Hall.\" Join \"Cactus\" on his adventures, as he makes some new friends and battles unsavory characters across the Old West - with his trusty six-shooter in one hand, and a nice, ice-cold cold, glass of milk in the other.\n\n(Source: DMG)",
