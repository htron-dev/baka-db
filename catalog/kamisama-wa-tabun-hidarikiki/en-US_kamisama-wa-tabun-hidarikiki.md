## Sinopse

Determined to pay off his father's debts, Yano works to create counterfeit money for the yakuza. Though he is really good, Yano can't quite make his "artificial" money perfect. That is, until he has Makura, a man skilled at art and creating counterfeits, thrust onto him by the yakuza. Given permission to use him anyway he wants... how will Yano use his human copy machine?
