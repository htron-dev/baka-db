    "sinopse": "Chizuru is your typical shrine maiden high schooler living in a shinto shrine. One day, her friend, Aki, asked her to do an exorcism for her but since Chizuru couldn't do it, they decided to ask the help of their attractive senior, Asakura, who's said to be able to do exorcisms. However, Asakura has an unbelievable fetish! In addition, Asakura's batchmate, Suyazaki, is just as much of a weirdo as he is! What shall Chizuru do as her fate gets entangled with such a ridiculous group of people?!\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)",
