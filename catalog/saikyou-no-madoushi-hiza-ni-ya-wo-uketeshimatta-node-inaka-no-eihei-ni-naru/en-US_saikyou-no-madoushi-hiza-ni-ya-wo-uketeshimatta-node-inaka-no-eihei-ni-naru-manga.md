## Sinopse

The strongest wizard Alfred, in a hero’s party, subdued the demon lord and in the process took a cursed arrow to the knee. Even with the hurt knee, Alfred’s still the strongest wizard ever. So Alfred just wanted some time to rest and recover, but no one would LEAVE HIM ALONE! Because of that, Alfred wished to spend time recovering in a small country village that no one knew about. So, the strongest wizard in the kingdom decided on living the slow life in the country.
