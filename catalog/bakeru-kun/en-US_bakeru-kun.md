## Sinopse

Kawaru is a typical ordinary elementary school boy until the day he enters into a “haunted house” to pick up the ball he accidentally throws in and finds a family of mysterious dolls. When he pushes the dog-doll’s nose button, he suddenly turns into a dog! Will he be able to clear the misunderstanding and transform back into a human?
