## Sinopse

"Inoue-san, you're my first boyfriend...", says Yamamoto, 28 years old. "I don't have a lot of experience either, but we'll work through it together", says Inoue, 32 years old.

In reality, Inoue's never been with a girl either, but he couldn't tell Yamamoto that.

A fluffy love-comedy about the adventures of this innocent and pure couple.
