## Sinopse

Sae is a flight attendant working for ANL (AeroNippon Lines, a fictious airline). She wanted to work in this field thinking on the glamourous aspect of the job since her friends at the university were teasing her about her sex-appeal. She'll discover the truth about being a flight attendant while having to deal with the passengers!
