Can these two damaged people figure out that their true feelings run much deeper than any monetary based transaction?\n\nIn Chapter 5, (A Bird at Sea, A Door in the Sky) Ryuu is a sad but tough kid from Osaka who is trying to overcome his past. When an American, Stefan, takes an interest in him, will it lead to more than just friendship? Ryuu's story is continued in the Kiss DJ. (This is part of the Rules series. A complete Rules series timeline can be found in the Synopsis for Rules.)",
