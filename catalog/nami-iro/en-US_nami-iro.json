    "sinopse": "The time of the folk dance is approaching in Takumi's school, the folk dance is a famous couples event thus people that are single and unpopular such as himself have absolutely nothing to do with it, well; he is part of the committee that sets up the event, so while he lacks romance his relationship to the event \"isn't zero\".\n\n.... Takumi, however keeps having this dream where a beautiful girl asks him to the folk dance, and being a \"couples event\" it's pretty obvious to him that someone asking him to ask is much deeper than a simple invitation for dancing..... But, a dream is a dream and even though Takumi keeps thinking to himself \"this seems so real\", the dream is still a dream; he can't even remember clearly the face of the girl that asked him out.\n\n..... What Takumi obviously doesn't notice, is that his tomboyish childhood friend and pretty much every of the other (female) member of the committee also don't have a partner for the folk dance, furthermore Takumi is not as unpopular as he perceives himself to be.... Could that dream be a foreboding one?\n\n(Source: MU)",
