    "sinopse": "It's the heyday of the alpha. Alphas have all of the riches and all of the power, which they indulge in without regard for anyone else. They look down on the obsequious omegas and betas... making waves in this inequitable society is landowner Maurice, with his shiny blond hair and skin like porcelain. He's the beautiful, smart, noble-minded son of the prestigious house of Seychelle. He's close with his personal attendant, Simon, but since he's the family heir, his fate of marrying an omega and having his own heirs is inescapable. Gender, status, and fate all set themselves against love.\n\n(Source: Sankosha, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Gunpuku no Order\n\nNote: Gunpuku no Order was collected in Choukyou Kakusei BL.",
