    "sinopse": "Japan in the Shouwa periode... They are tough times, particular in yonder region, which bathed by the river Shinano for hundreds of years. Ice-cold winter, poor harvest and hungry wolfs gives the people a hard time.\n\nYoung girls are one of the first victims of this crisis-ridden time - the last resort is often only the brothel or the factory. Under these hard circumstances grow up the young and beautiful Takano Yukie and try to go her own way of life - and in doing so, she don't dread to defy moral conventions...\n\nIn dramatic and beguiling sensual pictures created the novelist Okazaki Hideo and the illustrator of \"Lady Snowblood\" Kamimura Kazuo a wild and enthralling life story of a young woman searching for herself.\n\n(source: translated from the book cover)",
