## Sinopse

Professor Strangelove is about a student Hayama who has to work to pay his studies at the university. But because of his not so good grades the teacher has decided he has to help Professor Shiina with his research. Shiina invents all kind of crazy pills and drinks which give people cat ears and tail for example! It turns out to be even more problematic when the twin brother of Shiina lives next to him and tries to take his elder brother’s new “toy” away! The battle for Hayama's love has begun!
