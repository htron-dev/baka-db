## Sinopse

Paid to be his housekeeper or to warm his bed?

An afternoon at the races laced with champagne and women is just another event for Ethan Cartwright, until very ordinary Daisy Donohue catches his eye. Daisy knows to keep her head down and to stay invisible amongst the throngs of designer-clad socialites. But ruthless Ethan is intrigued by the drab assistant, and can't resist one passionate embrace!

Daisy is devastated to be fired for a kiss. She needs her job! That's where Ethan comes in. He has a new role in mind: Housekeeper by day, bedmate by night?
