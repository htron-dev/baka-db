## Sinopse

That man will take away both your heart and your body, together with the jewels...

Kaitou Crow is a beautiful, unidentifiable young man who's only after jewels. Ruri, the daughter of a jewel designer, accidentally saw the kaitou while he was going for a preliminary inspection. While snatching away Ruri's first kiss to seal her mouth, Crow announced that this time, he would steal both her heart and her body, together with the jewel...?

The dangerous love mystery of a conceited, forceful, beautiful, young and perverted kaitou!
