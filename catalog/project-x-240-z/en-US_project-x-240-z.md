## Sinopse

The Japanese automobile was seen as the inferior “second-class” vehicle in America during the 1960’s. During this time, there were men in Japan who dared to dream of the impossible: to build a Japanese sports car that would be popularly accepted worldwide. Through the zeal and innovation of Yutaka Katayama, now known as “Mr. K”, and the designing genius of Yoshihiko Matsuo, their dream was made real in the form of the legendary sports car, the Nissan Fairlady Z. Known as the Datsun 240Z in America, this sports car became an unprecedented success, and is still loved by fans today. (DMP)
