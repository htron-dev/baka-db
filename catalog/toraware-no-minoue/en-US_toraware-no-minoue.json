    "sinopse": "Megumi is a descendant of Kuronekomaru, a famous thief who stole an heirloom from a samurai’s mansion. When he opened the scroll, the family’s guardian dragon appeared and cursed Kuronekomaru and his descendants: his family is destined to serve Kougami’s family for one hundred generations. Megumi is living the high life, since the last of the Kougamis vanished two years ago. However, when Suzuka—the current generation of the Kougamis—returns home, Megumi has built up no resistance to the curse, so he is forced to serve her with a slave-like obedience.\n\n(Source: ANN)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Real no Arashi (Real Storm), Jikan wo Kourasete (Let the Time Freeze)\nVolume 3: Pere Noel no Nagai Yoru (The Long Night of Pere Noel)\nVolume 5: Kiss no Hontou no Imi wo Oshiete (Tell Me the Real Meaning of That Kiss)",
