    "sinopse": "Cursepenpal.net is a website made for people who wish to vent out their anger with another fellow online partner. Cheyool's just the unlucky one to be chattering with the school's biggest two face Yu se-ha who gives her the \"Salieri curse oooo, however they do not know who they are speaking to in real life of course.\n\nEven after Cheyool moved into the same complex. Even though they don't know who each other really is, they still treat each other as bitterly as they do online. This is the start of Cheyool's torturous years with the devil himself!\n\n(Source: Mangafox.com)",
