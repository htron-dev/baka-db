    "sinopse": "A hot-blooded manga publication fighting action series by the creators of \"Akumetsu\" and \"Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest.\"\n\nIn the manga publication industry, there is a legend:\n\nIf you leave a message on a bulletin board in the train station at Shibuya, you can obtain the services of a certain man ... No, not City H\\*nter. Comic Master J -- an assistant mangaka who can instantly complete any publication manuscript in any art style for the price of 5 million Yen. However, he refuses to work on manga without a \"soul.\"\n\nBut what is J's true identity? Why does he wear an overcoat lined with pens and rulers? Is his real name B\\*ack Jack? And for what reason does a man of such artistic talent choose to live in the shadows of the industry, rather than working on a manga of his own creation?\n\nJ's past and his relationship with the mysterious organization \"CLUB\" may tie in with a secret war for the fate of human culture as we know it ...\n\n(Source: Manga-Updates)",
