## Sinopse

Puruka is a parasitic alien who came to Earth in order to have offspring. After being saved by a busty high school girl named Fuuka, he begins to live inside of her head. It seems like he'll easily be able to complete his mission with such an attractive host, but things are complicated by Fuuka's crippling social anxiety.
