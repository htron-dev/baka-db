## Sinopse

Having sacrificed everything to land her position as the editor-in-chief of a fashion mag, Serena has every intention of taking advantage of the perks of her job—and that includes bossing around a younger cameraman under her! With his over-exaggerated reactions, Hal is an endless source of Serena's amusement—but such an abuse of power can only go on for so long until something gives!
