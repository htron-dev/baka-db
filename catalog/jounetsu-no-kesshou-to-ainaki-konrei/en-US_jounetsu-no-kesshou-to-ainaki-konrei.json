    "sinopse": "Princess Liliana \"Lili\" of Alagonia was always told she would one day marry a prince of Montedoro to secure peace. It was widely assumed that her husband would be the second prince, Rule, but he already loved another woman. When Lili learned of this fact, she was overcome by tears and sought comfort in the arms of the third prince, Alexander \"Alex.\"\n\nTwo months later, Lili is pregnant, so to avert an international crisis, she must quickly marry Alex. Though neither of them wants a marriage without love, they cooperate for the sake of their countries and unborn child. Lili, especially, believes she can make this relationship work, but meanwhile, Alex grapples with a past that haunts him to this day.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
