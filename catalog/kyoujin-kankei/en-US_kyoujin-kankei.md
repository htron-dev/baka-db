## Sinopse

Edo period, a young draftsman, Sutehachi, arrives at Katsuhika Hokusai' s house, the genius of the print and his daughter O-ei. If the boy's passion for drawing does not give way to that of the master, haunted just like him by the passion of the print, he is also very attracted by the world of pleasures.
