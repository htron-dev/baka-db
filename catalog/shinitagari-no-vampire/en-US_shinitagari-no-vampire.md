## Sinopse

University student Yuuki is a ghost painter who paints pictures on behalf of his father, who is a famous artist. One day, a beautiful vampire youth named Leo appears. Carrying a sad past, Leo wants to kill himself. While Yuuki is attracted to him, he could only paint his pictures. Eventually, providing a kiss as a substitute for blood gradually escalated... With a youth who has lost his "color" and an immortal vampire who is desperate to die, each day is sad but vivid.
