Carrying a sad past, Leo wants to kill himself. While Yuuki is attracted to him, he could only paint his pictures. Eventually, providing a kiss as a substitute for blood gradually escalated... With a youth who has lost his \"color\" and an immortal vampire who is desperate to die, each day is sad but vivid.\n\n(Source: Futabasha, translated)",
