    "sinopse": "A story about an excellent & manly salary man whose beauty is extraordinary, the senpai Kitagawa-san, and his dumb but very handsome kouhai, Nakamura-kun. In the middle of night, with a bottle of sake, a very girlish confession is to hover over the poor kouhai Nakamura-kun. Backed up with his very own fantasies and undeniable desires, he jumps his sempai Kitagawa-san, unexpectedly though Kitagawa-san doesn't have anything against it!! Two young men, two love birds, start the beginning of their love story!\n\n(Source: YaoiOtaku)",
