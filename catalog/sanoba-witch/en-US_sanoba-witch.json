    "sinopse": "One day, high schooler Hoshina Shuuji, who can sense peoples' feelings through his ordinary five senses, accidentally sees the popular Ayachi Nene masturbating in the school library. Nene is a member of the Occult Club, and commonly offers her classmates advice through fortune-telling. When Shuuji goes to apologize to her, he learns two things: the Occult Club is going to be closed due to lack of members, and Nene is actually a witch that is collecting 'soul fragments' that come from strong emotions. After he accidentally absorbs her collection of soul fragments, he decides to join her club, help her collect more, and try to find a way to give back the ones he took.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
