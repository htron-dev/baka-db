## Sinopse

Deep within Japan's remote regions is the mansion of Dr. Naomitsu Madaraki, a surgeon notorious for his gruesome work. While he is away from home, his artificial daughter Fran takes over the mansion and his grisly surgical practice. With the aid of her violent younger sister Veronica, the human-cat hybrid Okita, and Dr. Madaraki's other macabre creations, Fran deals with the unusual requests of her clients. From tumor removal to reviving the dead, no two jobs are alike, but no job is too difficult—or too dangerous—for the successor to Dr. Madaraki. This eccentric medical prodigy is willing to do anything to save a life, even if her results are seldom pretty.
