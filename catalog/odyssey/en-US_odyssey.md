## Sinopse

Similar to Sanctuary, Odyssey is another story on thought-provoking political revolution. This time the theater is international, as a group of young government elites execute their secret plan to rise Japan as the economic and military superpower in the Far East. How will they carry out their objectives? Is it through a new military presence, or through Japan's economy know-how? How will the U.S. respond to Japan's new "independence," and will the political and economic figures in control of Japan now let these young elites re-shape their world?
