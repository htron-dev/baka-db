## Sinopse

Although hailed as a musical prodigy since he was very young, Fukao Kairi, now a conductor/piano major at a conservatory, seems to have lost his passion for music. He skips class and lessons left and right and has not participated in any major competitions for years. His friends are concerned for his future, but it is only when Kairi meets Miyamura Ruka and encounters her undying love for Shion that he starts to change little by little. This story is about love and its true semblance.
