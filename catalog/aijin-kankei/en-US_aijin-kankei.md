## Sinopse

She was much more than his secretary Theirs seemed the perfect boss-secretary relationship. He was all hard-nosed business; she was efficient and anticipated his every need.

But the roles Max and Clea played so well in the office underwent a radical change after hours. Then they were passionate lovers--a situation Clea found both fulfilling and agonizing.

For while Max was capable of turning his passion on and off at will, Clea, with her youth and idealism, had fallen inescapably in love. She either had to hide her feelings or get out. Suddenly, unexpected circumstances gave her no choice.
