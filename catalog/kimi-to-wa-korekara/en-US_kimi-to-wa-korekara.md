## Sinopse

Monster customers, a boss who takes no responsibility, nonchalant coworkers, unreasonable departments... Food company customer support worker Tokura has racked up daily stress. One day after a stress induced meltdown, cleaning staff Keita offers himself up. "How about me?" While at first he can't imagine taking out his frustration on the self-described hardcore masochist, his pent-up anger incites him to sin. Drunk off of the pleasure of domination, Tokura begins to search for more sources of stress in order to have sex with Keita...
