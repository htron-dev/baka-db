    "sinopse": "In a drizzle, Elise desperately keeps herself not to collapse during her husband's funeral-- he always spent lavishly and repeatedly cheated on her and died leaving her a huge debt. Among the funeral attendees, she notices there is a distinctly handsome stranger. The man turns out to be Vincente, her husband's employer and a company owner. He invites Elise for dinner for some reason. She is alarmed with his eyes with full of risky temptation, but accepts his offer. What is his purpose?\n\n(Source: MU)",
