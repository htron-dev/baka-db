## Sinopse

Based on Emma Goldrick 's novel "And Blow Your House Down"

She couldn't hide her feelings for him... Because of the peculiar terms of an eccentric old lady's will, Sara was being virtually forced to live for six months in John Englewood's house. "I'm not your judge," he told her, "but I do have a terrible problem, and I need your help." Yet Sara could hardly believe he would invite her into his household -- especially when he thought her a wild and wanton child. Somehow, she had to show him she was a woman -- and a woman who knew exactly what she wanted.
