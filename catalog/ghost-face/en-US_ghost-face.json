    "sinopse": "Thousands of the world's most ruthless criminals are locked away in the ruins of a city on a wind-swept island called Sodo. Out of the writhing mass of vice and violence, the strongest of the ganglords have clawed their way to the top and set themselves up as local gods of the prison island. The corporate city-states which jailed these dangerous men and women rely on the unending tides of gang war to keep the criminals stranded—but since only the strong survive, the island instead serves as an incubator, bringing out the worst and most extreme in its captives. One such super-criminal has escaped Sodo, has broken into high-tech corporate labs on the mainland, and has stolen a chemical that could change everything.",
