    "sinopse": "A calm, quiet life at a new school is just what Aria needed. Unfortunately, it’s not what she got! Accidentally voted Student Council President on her first day, Aria’s attempts to just fit in are ruined by her nosy new classmates. Since she can't beat the use of her mocking former nickname, \"The Lovemaster\" she decides to go with it and turn the Student Council into a dating service! That’s great for the school, but will Aria ever solve her own love troubles? (Source: Go Comi)",
