Then, that night, while he's trying to sleep, Asahi notices that a guy's touching him. Even though he was half-hoping it was Akiomi, it turns out to be a handsome college student, Hayato, whom he's never met before...!! That's when Akiomi enters the room and the rest of the night is filled with shameful acts of love... Let this comedic love story about three guys living under the same roof begin!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
