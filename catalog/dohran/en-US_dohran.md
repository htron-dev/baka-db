## Sinopse

General Tokugawa was given 13 angel swords to bring peace to Japan. However just when Tokugawa started a new dynasty, he was assassinated by his 12 commanders, the masters of the 12 sacred swords. The last one, Fire Phoenix, was given to Dohran, Tokugawa's naive son. Many years have passed and now, under the cover of a traveler, Dohran is seeking for revenge and to bring back "the world of laughter."
