## Sinopse

Leigh agreed to take care of her seven-year-old niece, Amy, after the sudden death of her older sister and her husband. She took a break from studying graphic design at university to work and pay down her sister's debts, but the bank finally put the house in foreclosure. Leigh was devastated and decided to seek help from Amy's real father, Nicholas Kendall, the CEO of a major corporation who had a one-night stand with Amy's sister. At first, he doubted that Amy was his, but he changed his mind soon after meeting her. All Leigh wanted was to borrow a little bit of money, but instead Nicholas insisted that Leigh and Amy move into his house!
