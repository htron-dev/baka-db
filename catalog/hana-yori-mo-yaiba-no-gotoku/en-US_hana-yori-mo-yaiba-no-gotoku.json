    "sinopse": "The country of Japan is being terrorized by the undead, known as \"Revenants.\" Tachibana Kaguya makes it her life goal to protect her fellow citizens from these zombie-like creatures, just as her father did before her. When she enrolls in Reimeikan Academy, a school that specializes in training soldiers that will eventually become part of a movement to expel the Revenants once and for all, she is reunited with Tokugawa Ichii… a boy her father had died to protect—a boy who had promised to build her a world free of monsters.\n\n(Source: Dazzling Scans)",
