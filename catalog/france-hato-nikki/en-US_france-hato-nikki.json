    "sinopse": "Rina Fujita, a single woman whose currently unemployed and in her thirties, suddenly decides to move to France. However, just before her departure, she manages to get a contract for manga publishing! This poses little problem for Rina, as during the age of internet, she can very well combine these two projects!\n\nFrance Hato Nikki describes with realism and humor the mangaka's stay in Paris. Far from the cliché cute Japanese girl, she discovers the joys of the French lifestyle: flat-sharing, the conventional manga fans, public toilets, pickpockets, and... Nutella. A hilarious account, originating from a blog that gained great success!\n\n(Source: Editions Glénat, translated)",
