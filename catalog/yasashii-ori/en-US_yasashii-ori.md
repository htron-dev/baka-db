## Sinopse

"Possessions should act like possessions, and give up gracefully."

Private Secretary to a high powered businessman, Itsuki is surprised to hear that his employer has named the temperamental, sculptor Hitachi as the successor to his business. But does that include Itsuki himself? Hitachi seems to think so! Luckily, Itsuki has carried a torch for Hitachi for sometime now. So while Hitachi treats him as a doll with no free will, who exactly is the prisoner in the situation, is still up for debate...
