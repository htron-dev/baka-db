## Sinopse

Roland is known throughout the world as the Black Knight. He appears calm, cool, and collected on the outside, but secretly he’s anything but—he can’t talk to girls for the life of him.

One day, while doing his regular heroic thing, he comes across a slave girl bound and gagged. Roland suddenly realizes that if he saves this slave girl, he can slowly build up his social skills by talking to her. After all, a slave girl has to be as shy as him, right?
