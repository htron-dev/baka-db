    "sinopse": "People have gone so far as to call Kaname-kun a \"sex machine\" and \"a man who exists solely for obscenity and sin.\" But now he's fallen in love for the first time with the super cool beauty Yumi-sama. Even when his only reward is her cold gaze, he persists in his desire to win her love--but he's struggling and suffering because his wooing technique gets incredibly clumsy when he actually cares about the result!\n(Source: ShoujoMagic via B-U)",
