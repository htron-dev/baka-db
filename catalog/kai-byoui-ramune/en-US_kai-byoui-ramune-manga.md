## Sinopse

From a girl who cries condiments to a philanderer who finds a chikuwa in his pants where something else should be... Dr. Ramune can cure them all, but his treatments come at a cost, and not one that can be paid in money. Follow Dr. Ramune and his wacky patients in stories too unbelievable to be treated by anyone but the Mysterious Disease Specialist!
