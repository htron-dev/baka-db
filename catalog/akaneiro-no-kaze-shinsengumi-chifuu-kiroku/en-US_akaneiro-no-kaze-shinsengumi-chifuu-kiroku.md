## Sinopse

Starting in the year 1863, this manga retells the story of the Shinsengumi. There is a focus on Okita, who in this version of the story is an excellent swordsman that does not kill people. Instead, he strikes with the back of his sword, a practice that his friend Hijikata warns him will only cause him problems in the future. The thirteen young men of the Shinsengumi live through the tumultuous final years of the Tokugawa Shogunate.
