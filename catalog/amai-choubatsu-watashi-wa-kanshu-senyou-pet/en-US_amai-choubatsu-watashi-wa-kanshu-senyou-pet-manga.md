## Sinopse

Hina Saotome is a new prisoner at Kokuyoku Prison, having been sent there after she was framed. She is brought before the warden, the gorgeous Aki Myoujin, whose angelic face conceals his true sadistic nature. In this prison, his word is law, and he begins to take a particular interest in Hina, giving her unusual punishments.

Locked in this prison with no escape, Hina longs for the day when she can be free again. But soon, she begins to crave Aki's touch, and it becomes apparent that there is more to the warden's actions than she originally thought.
