## Sinopse

The pitiful Heartless crave for hearts. The rage of the Keyblade unleashes those hearts. Hearts gather in the darkness, and eventually create Kingdom Hearts; to create the sanctuary for those lost hearts, those are Kingdom Hearts. Roxas, without any memory regarding his past, has been accepted into the Organization XIII. The privilege of becoming a member of the Organization XIII comes the responsibility that each member upholds. However a question arises: "Why am I in the organization?" On top of the clock tower with the sunset in the horizon, the 14th member, a young girl, makes this question. Who is this young girl, and how does she fit into the plot? This is the revitalization of Kingdom Hearts; the new prequel that connects the puzzle pieces of the mysteries that still float about. This is Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days!
