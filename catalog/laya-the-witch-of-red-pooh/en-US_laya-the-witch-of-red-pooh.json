    "sinopse": "The fun never stops at Laya's place--home sweet home to some of the most ridiculous residents of that magical forest known only as Red Pooh!\n\nThrill to the riveting account of Puss, the loveable chain-smoking cat... Marvel at Snowy, part-time crow and full-time witness to the some of the forest's strangest scenes... Wonder at the legend of Niky, the flagrant freeloader who shamelessly squats in Laya's house! And, of course, there's Laya herself, the mystical witch who has somehow managed to gather all these characters under one roof...\n\n(TOKYOPOP.com)",
