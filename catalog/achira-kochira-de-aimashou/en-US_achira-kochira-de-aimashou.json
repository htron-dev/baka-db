    "sinopse": "Sal Senba is going to be the head of the Senba clan—a family with a long and distinguished history teaching the art of ikebana, or Japanese flower arrangements. He's not sure he's up for this role, though, being born into it instead of \"earning\" it. Months before the ritualistic ikebana exhibition to symbolize the succession, he falls into his mirror and finds himself in another world... one with a beautiful garden of flowers and an even more beautiful man. At first, Sal thinks this Prince Shaal has nothing to do with him... but little by little, he sees that they mirror each other more than he thought. An otherworldly romance between a super hot prince and a hottie in a kimono!!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
