## Sinopse

Father's restaurant is now in danger. To save our crisis, a young chef, Habuka, suddenly appeared in front of my eyes. He's a very rude bastard, when we met for the first time everything went wrong. And I don't know why he lives in my house! But now, I have to live with a red face and my heart beating fast around him.
