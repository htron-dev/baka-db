    "sinopse": "Kathleen's dream was to be a vocalist. That was until the accident that left her with an injured leg. Despite this, her music teacher, Sister Cecily, takes her to an audition. Kathleen is a classical musician, but the audition is being judged by Morgan Llewellyn, a world-famous musical composer. Kathleen performs as best as she can, but the fiercely masculine and overbearing Morgan coldly tells her that she could never be a star",
