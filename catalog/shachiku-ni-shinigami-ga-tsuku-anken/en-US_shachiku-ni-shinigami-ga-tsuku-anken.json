    "sinopse": "\"This is no time for you to die from work.\"\n\nShiori is talented at her job but overworked because she can’t say no when one day an all-too-serious and naive shinigami appears. Just as it seems she’s going to die earlier than scheduled due to her job, the shinigami begins to take care of her! An all-new romantic comedy ensues between this caring shinigami and brilliant corporate slave in Shachiku ni Shinigami ga Tsuku Anken.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
