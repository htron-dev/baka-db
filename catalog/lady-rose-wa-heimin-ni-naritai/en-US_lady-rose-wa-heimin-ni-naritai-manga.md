## Sinopse

Felicia Suwarose—noble, feminine, and the protagonist of an otome game—has various routes she can pursue, each revolving around an attractive man. But when a certain Japanese woman is reincarnated inside the game as Felicia, she is dismayed to find out that her current route leads to an ending with Prince Seth, a self-centered character she hates.

Nonetheless, as a result of dancing to the tune of the game's antagonist, Felicia herself becomes seen as a villain. Consequently, a furious Prince Seth annuls their engagement, reducing her status to that of a mere commoner—which is exactly what she wanted! Liberated from her unenviable fate, Felicia starts living a simple life, working in a bakery. But just when she thought she had it all planned out, another member of royalty comes strolling through her doors, beckoning the winds of change.

Faced with a whole new world of prospects and possibilities, Felicia begins to wonder if the game of her life was ever so straightforward after all.
