## Sinopse

Due to a false charge, Felicia Suwarose who was admired by the young ladies got her engagement with His Highness annulled and was expelled from school. There’s nothing but misunderstandings all around her, but the person herself only wants a rose-colored commoner’s life. It’s a story about characters from "Nation’s Saviour Lady Rose," an otome game from her previous life.
