    "sinopse": "Konakai Futaba loves her older sister more than anything else in the world. Kind, beautiful and intelligent, Ichina was everything that Futaba wished that she could be... she even encouraged Futaba when she was feeling down. As such, Futaba went to the same high school as Ichina, hoping to be reunited after two whole years of being apart. But sadly, Ichina has completely changed from the sweet, gentle sister that Futaba remembers... into a massive pervert.\n\n(Source: Sugooi Scans)",
