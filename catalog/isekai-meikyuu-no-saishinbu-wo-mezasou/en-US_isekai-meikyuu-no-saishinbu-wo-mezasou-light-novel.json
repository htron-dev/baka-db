    "sinopse": "\"I'll absolutely save you. Hence I will–!!\" Aikawa Kanami awakes in a corridor he has no recollection of, the wound he received from a goblin is cured by a pretty girl called Lastiara, and he learns that he's in a different world that's exceedingly similar to a game. Kanami makes into his weapon the hearty welcomed status and skills, and with a pretty girl Dia plunges forward towards the deepest part of the labyrinth that's rumoured to \"grant any wish\"–. This is a story of a boy who exposes the deepest part (truth) of the labyrinth and fulfills a wish.\n\n(Source: Heart Crusade Scans)",
