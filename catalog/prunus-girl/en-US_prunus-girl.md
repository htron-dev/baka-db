## Sinopse

Makito Maki meets the adorable Kizuna Aikawa under the falling cherry blossoms on the day high school entrance exam results are posted. It seems destined that the two will end up together. However, Maki’s dreams of getting a cute girlfriend are crushed when on the first day of school, Kizuna reveals she is in fact a male.

After the shocking revelation, Maki tries to move on from Kizuna, but fate has other plans in store, as the two start running into each other every day. Though Aikawa is willing to extend a friendly hand, Maki still has a hard time getting over that Aikawa is really a boy. Nonetheless, as Aikawa drags Maki along on various adventures, he sees that Aikawa is truly a kind person and learns that people should not be defined by their appearance or gender.
