    "sinopse": "Shizuku is not good with boys. Whenever she is touched, her reflex's end up nearly killing them. Many male students have been part of this blood fest. The villany, sadist student body president, who quietly watches Shizuku, forces her to join the student council! “I’ll fix your complex,” the president declares to Shizuku. And suddenly, he gives her a breath-taking kiss. Even Shizuku can’t raise her hand against him?\n\n(Source: ChibiManga).",
