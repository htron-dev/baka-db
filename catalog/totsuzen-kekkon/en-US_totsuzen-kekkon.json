    "sinopse": "Millionaire bachelor Grant O'Hara thought the pretend marriage ceremony was just another Mardi Gras festivity until he and Cheyenne Tarantino were pronounced legally wed. Grant wasn't ready to settle down, and he'd only just met his wife. But, since nothing could be done until morning, Grant saw no reason not to play honeymoon with his shy, beautiful bride.\n\nBut Cheyenne sure did. She'd long ago vowed to save herself for her real wedding night. Still, Grant's thoughtfulness and irresistible charm were wearing her down. And soon, Cheyenne was wondering how she could turn their one-night marriage into forever....",
