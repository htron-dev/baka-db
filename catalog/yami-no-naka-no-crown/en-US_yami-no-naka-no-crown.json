    "sinopse": "Everyone in the world is born with two things: the ability to collect \"Life's Light\" and a \"Light Vessel\" in which to hold the collected \"Life's Light\". Most people use their vessels to assist them in doing various tasks but occasionally someone is born with a vessel that allows them to do battle with. The protagonist, Ruyu, stumbles upon the end of a battle only to find one survivor. Could the young boy she saved be connected to the king's men who entered the town with the intent of killing everyone?\n\n(Source: Dan@PopulationGO)",
