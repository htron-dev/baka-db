## Sinopse

While Souta was alone, masturbating in his apartment, he realizes someone is watching him: a ghost of a salaryman named Kazuma Nishino. Nishino has recently died and found out that only Souta can see him. Through this strange situation, Souta agrees that Nishino can live with him until he ascends into another life. A relationship forms as Souta is cured of his "trauma" and Nishino finally finds out how he died.
