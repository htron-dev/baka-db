## Sinopse

Corrine wants a promotion in her company and makes the highest bid to win three dates with rumored playboy Rand Pearson. She just wants someone to escort her to events; that was the original plan. But when the gorgeous Rand approaches, Corrine cannot keep her body still. The so-called ice queen can feel her heart wavering before this new man. But Corrine simply doesn't have time for romance—she has a goal to accomplish. She needs romance to take a back seat while she spends time with this dangerously handsome man!
