## Sinopse

Enter Hiroto Minase, the hero—or rather, Blue Knight—of the action TV series "Knights of the Holy War: Grand Knights." And he's feeling blue, alright. He just wants to get to know his stuntman, Takafumi Imagi, but all his attempts to invite him out for drinks have been declined without fail. One day, Minase spots Imagi out on the streets and runs after him—and into a gay bar?!
