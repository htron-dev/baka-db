What would it happen if, to Shinjuku, one of the biggest districts of Tokyo, a man came to empty of his blood in the street at broad daylight? How would the political and sanitary authorities manage the drama? Think, please, about the question as long as you still have the possibility of it because for the professors Onodera and Sekiguchi it is already too late! An emergent virus begins to insinuate itself slowly into the arteries of the Japanese capital?",
