## Sinopse

A sequel to Irotoridori no Hikari which will wrap up the story.

When he was a child, Yuuma received a special power from the "translucent magician," Shinku. Just by touching someone with his hand, he is able to cure all of their wounds in return for some of his memories. In the furthestmost port town of Kazatsugahama, there is a link to a another world hidden in the basement of the Arashiyama-sou dormitory. Within this world he lives his life like a dream. One night while the full moon shone brightly, a girl descended from the sky. "Mister magician, please save me."
