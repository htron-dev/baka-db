## Sinopse

Yuu Takamiya is an ordinary guy who's never had much luck in work or love – and just happens to moonlight as a private eye. Things start getting complicated when he's assigned to shadow his boss at the art gallery, the kind-hearted Masaya Shikibu. Then, after an accident at work, he meets Minoru Kuji, a brilliant scupltor who stirs up old memories. Before long, Yuu is working for Minoru as an artist's assistant, while struggling to stay objective on Mr. Shikibu's case. But there's more to Minoru than meets the eye, and as they grow closer, Yuu may learn things he'd rather not know...
