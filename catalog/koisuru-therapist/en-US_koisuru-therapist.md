## Sinopse

To gain some good publicity for his book tour, sex therapist Dylan agrees to pair up with Grace, another sex therapist, for a showdown on a TV show. However, the night before the show, he accidentally walks in on her in the middle of a shower! He has always promoted abstinence, so there's no way he can lose to a therapist who always calls men beasts. And yet, he can't get her out of his head. Is this battle going to start with him losing to the attractive, dazzling woman who has him so captivated?
