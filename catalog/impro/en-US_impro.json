    "sinopse": "Impro! is a 4-koma comedy centered around the club, its activities and the relationships between its members as they prepare for their plays.\n\nAmano Yuuki, a popular first year high school girl, gets invited to join the drama club by her classmate Ishikawa Nao. Even though she has no experience, she joins the club. In the company of the club president Akizuki Saya and her yuri antics, the petite and equally inexperienced Nishina Miyako, will she be prepared for the big show during the culture festival? And along the way, will she also melt the heart of the cool, aloof veteran of the club, Takanashi Tobari, who until Yuuki's arrival had kept mostly to herself?\n\n(Source: MU)",
