Only after she’s completely ignored and abused him does she realize the frog has changed into a handsome prince! Miyoul is a feisty high schooler whose only thoughts are of the hottest boy in school, Guelin. But her childhood friend, Heerack, who acts as her personal lackey, is deeply in love with her. Will Miyoul be able to see which is the frog and which is her true prince? (Source: Tokyopop)",
