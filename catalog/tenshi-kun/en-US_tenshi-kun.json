    "sinopse": "With no job and no money, Tesshuu was the unluckiest guy ever. To escape from this hellish-life he tried to break into and steal from the house of this rich guy who once spewed many harsh words to him, only to find that same guy being teased by sex tools and restrained?!\n\n\"Ironic, getting turned on over some poor scumbag thrusting you, huh.\" Hence starts the brutally erotic revenge. The relationship between super good-looking student versus dark sullen high school teacher is... Heart-warming? Violent?\n\n(Source: Takeshobo, translated)",
