Graduating from this high school essentially means you'll succeed in life, but graduating is very difficult. The school's head master is, a bear called Monokuma? He explains that the only way to graduate is to kill one of your classmates and get away with it. If the other classmates discover the identity of the killer, only they will be \"punished\". However, if they fail to catch the killer, only the killer graduates and the others are \"punished\". Which of the 15 will survive the lessons to come?\n\nThis adaption of the manga shows the other students point of view.\n\n(Source: MU)",
