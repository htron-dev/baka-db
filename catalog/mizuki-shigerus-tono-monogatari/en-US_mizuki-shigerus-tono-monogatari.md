## Sinopse

In celebration of it's 100th anniversary in publication, Mizuki Shigeru illustrates 29 of the stories contained within the legendary book, "Tono Monogatari" (Tales of Tono), which was originally written way back in 1910 by the much revered "Godfather of Yokai", Yanagita Kunio.

Each of the 29 chapters is a faithful adaption of their respective stories seen through the eyes of a studious Mizuki Shigeru.
