## Sinopse

A cool high school romance laced with the thrill of street dancing!

Midori just started high school and isn't interested in guys. She thinks they're all like her brother, Takeshi, who is rude and spoiled. Her way of thinking changes when a classmate of hers is pulled into the street dancing team led by Takeshi and his best friend, Sutou.

At first glance Higa may seem like a plain and quiet guy, but when the music starts flowing and his body starts moving, he transforms into a completely different person... Even Midori can't keep her eyes off him.
