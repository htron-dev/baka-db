## Sinopse

Alice is a girl who appears in the eyes of those who are drowning in anxiety and lust, and who reincarnates from their hatred, resentment and despair. She manipulates human dreams at will, revealing visions and getting to the truth behind the heart. The story of a dreamer that traverses the genres of mystery, fantasy, science fiction, and erotism.
