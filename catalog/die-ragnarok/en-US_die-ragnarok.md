## Sinopse

The great satana, from always frozen in Antarctica, without warning risveglia partially. All this provokes an opening in the barrier that bloccava the devils in the other dimensions with the consequence to trigger an invasion of our material plan. Two agents of the Dante will have to think to us to tranquilize the situation and rispedire the demons to hell. (Source: M-U)
