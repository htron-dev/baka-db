## Sinopse

Cerberus—the guard dog of the underworld—is a clumsy puppy who can’t do his job. Although Cerberus is constantly causing trouble for his master, Hades, he is always forgiven for being just so darn cute. So goes this wonderfully fluffy tale of life in the underworld. This heartwarming full-color comic is a must-see for all the dog-lovers out there!
