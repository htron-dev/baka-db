## Sinopse

The notoriously vicious Chinese Mafia has lost its next rightful heir . . . to sudden suicide! Now the esteemed "God of Dogs" Tsai family must race against the ticking clock and hunt down the child of the deceased eldest son in order to preserve their ancient, sacred legacy. Meanwhile, the mysterious Archer has been convicted of killing his father and is on his way to jail. What will fate reveal for the powerful Tsai clan's criminal dynasy AND this strange young man?

In God of Dogs, a feared family demands the service of a special descendant . . . but can the chosen one fight back? A rebel with a mind of his own is trapped in a bloodline riddled with secrets, murder and the constant threat of betrayal. Will he break the centuries-old chains that bind him to this history of violence and stand on his own two feet, or does he have no choice but to bow at the altar of his wicked forefathers? (June)
