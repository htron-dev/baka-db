## Sinopse

"R" or rather Room 402 is the room where our illustrious female main character lives. One day which seems to be by mere coincidence her fate intertwines with that of Sasamoto, a savvy man who seems to be down in the dumps. That is until he picks up a trinket which fell from her nether regions. Prepare yourself for a story of sexual psychological horror as Sasamoto enters into a brave new world.
