    "sinopse": "\"R\" or rather Room 402 is the room where our illustrious female main character lives. One day which seems to be by mere coincidence her fate intertwines with that of Sasamoto, a savvy man who seems to be down in the dumps. That is until he picks up a trinket which fell from her nether regions. Prepare yourself for a story of sexual psychological horror as Sasamoto enters into a brave new world.\n\n(Source: Ciaran Hillock)",
