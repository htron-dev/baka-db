## Sinopse

A young man named Lest has been chosen to be Selphia's prince. He is entrusted with the town's farmland after Venti, the human form of the wind dragon Ventuswill, recognizes his potential to be an Earthmate—an individual with the ability to cultivate the land and harness a monster's power. Having no memories of his past, Lest spends his days returning the kindness he receives from the inhabitants of Selphia.

With reports of monsters attacking people, Lest goes to Yokmir Forest to further investigate the alarming matter. Accompanied by Venti and his close friend Margaret, Lest is determined to protect the town he deeply loves.
