## Sinopse

Ran Takamine is beautiful, intelligent, and athletically proficient. Her near-perfect demeanor causes her classmates to deem her difficult to approach, often comparing her to a flower blooming high atop a mountain. However, an encounter with the blissfully carefree Akira Saeki surprises yet comforts her. After all, not all people are afraid of her.

When Ran's mother requests her to visit Soleil, a small but elegant flower shop across town, she never expects to run into Akira again. As it turns out, his family owns Soleil and he helps around the store. But this fact embarrasses him so much that he urges Ran to keep it a secret. Enraptured by their incidental meeting, Ran continues to notice Akira at school to the point where she can no longer brush off her thoughts about him. As days turn into weeks, Ran begins to wonder which warms her heart more—the exotic blossoms at Soleil, or the boy who can speak the language of flowers.
