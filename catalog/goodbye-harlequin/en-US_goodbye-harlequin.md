## Sinopse

Under the dazzling spotlights, with the sound of shutters echoing all around, top male model Shimizu Eichi is in his element. Attention-lover though he may be, there's one pair of eyes he'd rather not have on him...even though they're ones that have followed him diligently for a long time. It's been ten years since they were classmates and one-off sexual partners, but Kubo Akino is back—now a fashion designer for a top brand and determined to have Eichi in every way possible.
