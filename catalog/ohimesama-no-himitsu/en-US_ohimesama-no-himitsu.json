    "sinopse": "Miu Nishie was told to always appear cute in preparation for her future prince. Unfortunately, finding her knight in shining armor is a little difficult at an all-girls school. The closest thing to a dreamy stud is the school idol, Nagisa Fujiwara, whose stunning and boyish appearance captivates many of her underclassmen.\n\nWhile applying makeup in the bathroom, Miu hears a scream and something crash. Rushing to see what happened, she finds Fujiwara standing above the shattered remains of a vase. Desperate to keep her slip-up under wraps, Fujiwara drags Miu to the back of the school and begs her to keep the incident a secret, willing to do anything in return. Seeing an opportunity, Miu requests that they begin dating as preparation for the day she meets her fated lover. But as the schoolgirls' tale of comedy and romance unfolds, the princess realizes that her prince might be closer than she once thought.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shot: Houkago no Kanojo",
