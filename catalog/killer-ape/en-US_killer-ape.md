## Sinopse

In the distant future, advances in AI technology led to wars being fought without human soldiers. However, at the end of the 22nd century, a mysterious aircraft called "Gayla" shut down all AI, and humanity now must relearn how to wage war. Teppei Sakamoto joins the military in hopes of becoming a soldier, where he is sent into a simulation of the Battle of Waterloo to learn how to kill people.
