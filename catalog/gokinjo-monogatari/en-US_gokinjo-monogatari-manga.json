    "sinopse": "Mikako dreams of being a fashion designer, so she sets her eyes on attending Yazawa Arts with her childhood friend Tsutomu. But, he looks like a famous rock star and attracts more attention than she'd like, especially from a popular upperclassman. Incapable of dealing with her own feelings towards Tsutomu, Mikako devotes all of her time to a new 'flea market' club she's created with her friends on campus. But, it seems to bring her more into contact with Tsutomu than ever before.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
