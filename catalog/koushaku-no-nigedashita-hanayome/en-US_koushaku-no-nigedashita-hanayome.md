## Sinopse

In the middle of Belinda's wedding, a man's voice suddenly rings out saying, "Belinda is my wife." The owner of that voice is none other than real estate mogul and Marquess of Eastershire Colin Granville. On a trip to Las Vegas two years ago, Belinda completely forgot herself and gave in to the sweet temptation of this sexy and handsome man. She ended up saying something incredibly foolish. "If we get married, I'll sleep with you." She never would have thought that she would then go on to not only marry him, but actually sleep with him, too... The next day, they'd planned to file for an annulment, but now he's butting in on her wedding!
