## Sinopse

Kokoro is a girl who is in the habit of leaving everything half-done. However, her encounter with a boy helps her break this habit. He also helps her pass a high school entrance examination. She has a desire to meet him again, but the only key to find him is a fukusa (a small silk cloth used in tea ceremony) that he gave to her. That fukusa has an autograph of Izumi, a celebrity in the tea ceremony circle.
