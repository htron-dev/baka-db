## Sinopse

Ever since she was in fifth grade, Otome Yamada has longed to be a heroine in a play. This led her to join the drama club upon entering high school, but because of her unusual, anime-sounding voice, she has only ever been a stagehand. Undeterred, she tries to go to an audition for a play, but accidentally ends up at a recording studio for an anime series. Although she gets thrown out after unknowingly getting in the way of the recording, a talent agent impressed by her performance offers her a job as a voice actress. Spurred on by her dream, she eventually accepts the offer, leading her to working with the popular voice actress Suzu Ayase.
