    "sinopse": "Having an attractive face and figure, sparkling career, trusted by the superiors and idol among the juniors—that is our protagonist Maki, a woman around 30. On the other hand, we have Nagisa—a natural-born hottie who works as a teacher at an all-boys school and tries hard to hide a certain secret. What will happen when the two start living together?! A food-love-comedy, describing the unlikely cohabitation of two completely different people—a woman with no luck in men and a man with no interest in women—and centered around the topic of \"food.\"\n\n(Source: Aerandria Scans)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 13: Celosia Candle",
