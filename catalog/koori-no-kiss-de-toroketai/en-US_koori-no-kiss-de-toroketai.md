Sugimura Nozomi made a pact with her childhood friend Hyoudo Rei who both have a passion for ice-skating that when they grow up,they will both pair up to get into the olympics.But then Rei moves away.

Years later, Nozomi transferred to a school famous for its students' emphasis on ice skating.There she unexpectantly meets up with Rei only to find him indifferent to ice skating. But Nozomi will not give up on her dream even if Rei has and she's determined to make it to the school ice-skating club and bring Rei with her as her partner.
