    "sinopse": "Daiki Miyano is a 16-year-old boy who enjoys surfing the web in his free time. One particular night, he sees a live stream from a girl named Momo. He falls in love with her voice the moment he hears it, and has been watching her streams ever since.\n\nOne day while on his way to school, he runs into and knocks down a gloomy girl named Momono Ohashi, noticing her pink-striped panties when she falls. Later that night, when he is watching Momo's stream, Momo decides to stop the stream early. However, when she trips and falls, Daiki notices that she is wearing the same pink-striped panties as Momono. Could it be that these two peculiar girls are the same person?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
