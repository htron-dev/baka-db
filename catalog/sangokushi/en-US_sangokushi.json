    "sinopse": "At the end of the Han Dynasty in China the Imperial Court was collapsing to the point of no repair. With corrupt eunuchs and selfish relatives manipulating the emperor, the government was becoming obsolete and peasant uprisings breaking out all over the country. When Zhang Jue founds the \"Way of the Great Peace\" order, he rallies enough followers to leads the largest revolt yet: The Yellow Turban Rebellion. This is where the curtain on history is raised. It all starts with a man named Liu Bei Xuande. When he forms a brotherhood with Guan Yu and Zhang Fe, together they take a step toward suppressing the rebellion and bringing unity back to China.\n\n(Source: Jmanga)",
