Homosexual behaviour is strictly frowned upon, and leads to physical punishment. (No, not the kind you're thinking, unfortunately.) The leader Sawatou, nicknamed \"Doberman\", tall, dark, handsome, and with a cape, impresses Kippei so much that he instantly falls in love. But with Sawatou despising homosexuals, surely that love is doomed to failure?",
