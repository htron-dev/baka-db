## Sinopse

From mangaupdates.com:

Shingo and Kippei are making out in a secret place at school. Not secret enough, however, because the people who run the student council find them there. Homosexual behaviour is strictly frowned upon, and leads to physical punishment. (No, not the kind you're thinking, unfortunately.) The leader Sawatou, nicknamed "Doberman", tall, dark, handsome, and with a cape, impresses Kippei so much that he instantly falls in love. But with Sawatou despising homosexuals, surely that love is doomed to failure?
