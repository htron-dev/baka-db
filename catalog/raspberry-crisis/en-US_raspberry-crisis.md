## Sinopse

1-3) Raspberry Crisis
Ibuki is adorable and cute, but he wants to be a manly man like suave Ichinose sensei, or cool rock star Towa, his childhood friend. Unfortunately Ibuki's uncontrollable cuteness is too much for even the strongest manly man to resist...

4-5) White Breath
Shunsuke's parents were killed in a fire, so he was taken in by his dad's collegue. Their son (Chihiro) is is his best friend, but after several years have passed Shunsuke keeps giving Chihiro the cold shoulder. Just why has Shunsuke's attitude towards Chihiro changed, and why does he slave away at Chihiro's house?
