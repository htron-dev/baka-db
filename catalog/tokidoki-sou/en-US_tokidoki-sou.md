## Sinopse

Lisa moves to Tokyo for university, and she finds herself living with some strange people! The Russian girl Irina explains that the inhabitants work on a time machine together. The other people include Kitsune (who wears a fox mask), Hime (who cooks), and Aki (a self-declared scientific high school genius). This 4-koma style manga follows Lisa's bizarre new life.
