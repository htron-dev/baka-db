A lone boy stopped them with his \"moonfall strategy,\" but he disappeared soon after.\n\nAfter three years, a boy known as Kyle Kamishiro appears on the outskirts of a city. When monsters attack again, he demonstrates the power to manipulate the odds of probability. Despite his efforts, he is afterward drafted into the \"Guilty Children,\" a unit of children who are guilty of crimes.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
