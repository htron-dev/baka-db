    "sinopse": "“Wanna sleep with me and see?” said the beautiful young man, Shunen, to the not-so-ordinary salary man Yuuki! “DON’T SUCCUMB TO LUST!” preached the serious Yuuki. Yet, under Shunen’s skillful seduction, Yuuki was unable to resist! As fate would have it, turned out to be Yuuki's betrothed! And unbeknownst to Yuuki, Shunen has a perculiae quirk... he couldn’t live without sex! This totally turned Yuuki’s monotonous life upside down and inside out! Enjoy this erotic comic of Yuuki and Shunen.\n\n(Source: Fantasy Shrine)",
