## Sinopse

The only one the virile King Lehar wants to embrace in his arms, even if he has to destroy the whole country, is the lascivious commander of the neighboring country, Lilienthal, whose appearance is as lovely as a princess. Together in battle, they have also spent many affectionate nights of mutual love. A collection of touching love stories all around the world. With historical boys gorgeously recorded. (Source: CT)
