    "sinopse": "This is the story of Sakaki Yuuto, a 17-year-old high schooler who ends up with an unusual job: breaking up relationships by making girls fall in love with him. Unfortunately, in spite of his good looks, he is useless when it comes to women. While his younger brother chases the males and his older brother guides them from behind the scenes, will he be able to successfully play his part and charm the target? And most importantly, will he be able to obey the number one rule of the 'Breakup House,' to never fall in love with the target?\n\n(Source: MoonFlower Scans)",
