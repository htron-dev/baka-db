## Sinopse

"The World" is a massively multiplayer online game played by more than twelve million people across the globe. Within this virtual world Haseo, a PK (Player Killer), continues an endless fight. Everything he does is for the sake of the girl Shino, who back in the real world, is hospitalized by an unexplained coma. However, on finally meeting with his sole lead, a PK called "Tri-Edge," Haseo is dropped back to Level 1 by a mysterious power! Can Haseo save Shino now that he has lost all of his abilities? Tatsuya Hamasaki, writer of the scenario for the .hack//G.U. games, now turns his hand to its novelization!
