## Sinopse

Raid, a newbie Edge Punisher in The World R:2 decides to sell all of his gear and items in order to buy a rare sword. Unfortunately the sword draws the attention of a group of PKers who decide to kill him and steal the sword for themselves. Dead, naked, and penniless it seems that it's all over for Raid, when he is suddenly saved by a group of players from the Seventh Division of the guild Moon Tree.
