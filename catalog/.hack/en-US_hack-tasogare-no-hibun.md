Lara Hoerwick is visiting her uncle Harald, and starts playing a game on his computer while he is away. At first she is excited to find herself in the world of the Epitaph of Twilight, until she realizes that she's stuck in the game. To make matters worse, the game's world is about to be destroyed by the Cursed Wave. Lara's only hope is to set out in search of the Twilight Dragon.
