## Sinopse

It follows the traditional 4koma with non-canon meetings between characters from both universes.

The first few comics have mostly .hack//Games humor, but the majority explore the idea of inserting Kite and his friends into the .hack//G.U. storyline. Most of the humor comes from Kite's altered personality or the exaggerated personalities of other characters, mainly Atoli.
