## Sinopse

In Tsubakiyama High School, there is a system that splits the students into two class: "Special Class" and "Ordinary Class." The students from the different classes are forbidden from interacting with each other.

But Meguru Ueda, a student from Ordinary Class, and Manato Asou, a student from Special Class, are declaring that they are friends!

That's what makes the new interactions between Ordinary Class's students and Special Class's students begin!
