## Sinopse

Masaki Ashizawa was hired by a restaurant mogul to find a world-class chef for his new French restaurant. He finds the perfect candidate in Shuichiro Tsubaki, the gruff master chef of a small restaurant. But the proud Tsubaki is happy calling the shots in his own business and Ashizawa must go to all-new lengths to convince him to accept the offer.

What will it take for Ashizawa to clinch the deal? And what secret from his past is Tsubaki keeping from Ashizawa?
