## Sinopse

Having moved schools frequently throughout his childhood, Fujino has perfected the art of the false smile. Now his fifth school, his well-mannered smile is safely helping him make new friends, but one day, on the school roof, he finds a scarred boy sleeping there. That boy is the "Mad Dog," the student all his classmates are afraid of. While Fujino is observing him, the boy opens his eyes, and then...

A youthful love story between an unsociable yankee and a 'good boy' honour student.
