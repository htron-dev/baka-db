## Sinopse

It is a world where order is maintained by three great factions, the Church which bears the greatest authority, the Order of Clausius possessing influence on par with the Church, immense assets and military might, and lastly the Guild of Commerce, an association of merchants and artisans alike.

The alchemist Kuusla who was captured and imprisoned because he committed the offense of trying to burn a saint's bones, sold his skills and talents to the Order of Clausius. Together with an old friend, Welland, they were then dispatched towards the town of Grubetti which was close to the front lines.

And then at a workshop in Grubetti which boasted advanced equipment due to being near the front lines, Kuusla met the devout nun Urle Fenesis who had introduced herself as a "watchdog."
