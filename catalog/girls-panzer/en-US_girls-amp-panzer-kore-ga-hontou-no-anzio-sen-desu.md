## Sinopse

After a brilliant victory over Saunders University High School, girls from Ooarai now have to face Italian-themed Anzio Girls High School in the second round of the 63rd National High School Sensha-Dou Tournament. The high-spirited girls from Anzio, led by the charismatic Chiyomi Anzai, advance toward the battle equipped with baffling tactics and a secret weapon.

Ooarai will soon find out that what seemed to be a mere formality might take an unexpected and possibly disastrous turn. Whether they will win the match, or lose and doom their school to a closure, is still on a knife-edge.
