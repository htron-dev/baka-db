## Sinopse

The manga centers around Noemi Kohiyama, a second-year student at Count High School, a school with no established reputation in the world of tankery. Her first match as a tank commander is against Saunders University High School. She directs the crew of her tank with her orders, and she follows the orders of their team leader. At that time, she remembers the words that her senior said to her.
