    "sinopse": "Pretty boy Kaoru Komatsuna is self-conscious about his feminine good looks and his cute, but girly, name. Handsome school boxing champ Junya Kubo just happens to pick up Kaoru's notebook and proceeds to make fun of his strange name. Kaoru gets angry and knocks down the champ. This inspires Kubo to desperately try to convince Kaoru into becoming a boxer. After doing his best to resist him, Kaoru finds himself falling for the relentless knockout, Kubo.\n\n(Source: Aurora Publishing)",
