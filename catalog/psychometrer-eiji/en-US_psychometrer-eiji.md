He doesn't do well at school. He has no girlfriend. But he has never lost a fight. He is a typical high school delinquent. And his name is Eiji Asuma. True, he has special powers, but he keeps them to himself. You see, he can read incidents and memories from the past when he touches people or things. Yes, he has psychometric powers.
