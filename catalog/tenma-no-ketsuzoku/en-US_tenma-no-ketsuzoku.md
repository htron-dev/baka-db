## Sinopse

Altojin lives in the time of Ghengis Khan... She's a strong-willed warrior raised on the grassland plains of the country of Chigul. While out hunting with the Imperial Prince Olsbolt, Altojin saves his life from a would-be assassin. Suspecting that the assassin was sent by his father, Olsbolt then kills his father -- the reigning sovereign of Chigul, Biruge Han. That night, Olsbolt goes to Altojin's home to hide, but while he is away for a moment, Altojin's entire family is slaughtered! What will become of the young warrior Altojin and the bold prince Olsbolt...!?
