## Sinopse

A sudden upset stomach sends young Iwai dashing into a nearby coffee shop. What he wasn't expecting was the short haired, cute young lady waiting behind the counter. That sole encounter was enough to take over Iwai's every thought, still not even knowing the name of his little coffee shop angel... Brought to you by the author of [Chima Chima] and [Machi Machi], a touching love story portraying all of the little intricacies and beauty only found in a high school love.
