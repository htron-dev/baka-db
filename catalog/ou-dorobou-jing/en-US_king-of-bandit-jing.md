## Sinopse

Take a fantastical, far-out journey in the out-of-this-world adventures of Jing and his feisty, feathered friend Kir. Twilight Tales is an awesome new series with a fresh, original look for our heroes! When Jing sets his sights on a valuable jewel in the coffin of a notorious mafia boss, is he really playing with fire? Will Jing get away with it all, or does la cosa nostra's reach extend beyond the grave?
