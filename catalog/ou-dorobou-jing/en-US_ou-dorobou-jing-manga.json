    "sinopse": "A flying ghost ship filled with gold-stuffed zombies? Now that sounds like a worthy target for Jing, King of Bandits. Joined by his avian sidekick Kir and the lovely Rose (who is actually an undercover cop trying to catch him in the act!), Jing hitches a ride onboard the ghost ship only to discover that the ship is really a luxury casino. But it's no ordinary gold that these guests are playing with. These gold coins bite back and bite hard, feeding on the greed that the casino attracts. Can Jing break the curse and come away with the loot?\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
