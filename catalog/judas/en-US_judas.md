## Sinopse

Salvation may be at hand, but now is the time for prayer...

Judas, cursed for his sins, is the spirit of Deathâ€”he is without form, and has enslaved young Eve to carry out the most heinous of acts. Together in spirit and body, they must slay 666 people, so that Judas can regain his humanity!
