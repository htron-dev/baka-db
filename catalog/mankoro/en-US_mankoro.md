## Sinopse

When he was younger, Takada Nozomu aspired to be a mangaka... now, 10 years later, at age 29, he works at a convenience store and has completely given up his dream until his younger, talented coworker Mimura, who shares his dream, convinces him to give it a chance and sign up for a website for amateurs to publish their manga online.

Once they sign up, they are suddenly summoned to a mysterious space called the "Manga Colosseum" and forced to participate in a so-called "death game," competing by drawing manga with their lives on the line.

As he faces the challenge, Takada begins to rediscover his passion for manga... but can someone who's given up once be able to survive in this game...?
