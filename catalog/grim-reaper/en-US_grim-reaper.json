    "sinopse": "Yuuka Shinchiro is a Second Year High School student whose parents passed away several years ago in an accident.\n\nWhen he's walking through a park at night, a child's head jumps into his hands and he's bitten by an alien. Soon after, he wakes up and dismisses what happened as just part of his dream, until he notices the bite mark that appeared just where it was in his \"dream\"!\n\nThe next morning, the news reports that a child's head was found in a park along with lots of blood. As he goes to check out the scene, he finds a violent man asking him about the \"abyss\". The violent man later visits his house and calls him the Grim Reaper.\n\n(Source: MU)",
