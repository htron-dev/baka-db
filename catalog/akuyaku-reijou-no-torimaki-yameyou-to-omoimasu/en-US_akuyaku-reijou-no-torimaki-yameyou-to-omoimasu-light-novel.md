## Sinopse

When I noticed, I was Villainess's Follower B! Huh? Isn't this the world of the game my daughter played before?! Suddenly, I, the Earl's daughter Cosette, regained my memories of a previous life and was appalled by my chubby body and started dieting. Using the skills I've cultivated continuously in my previous life as an older woman, today Cosette will push forward!
