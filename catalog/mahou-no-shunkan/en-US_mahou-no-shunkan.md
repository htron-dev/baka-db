Lisa was having a vacation in sunny Spain when she was involved in a car accident. The owner of the car, Angus Hamilton, takes her to the hospital. Angus turns out to be a man of high society—someone whose path Lisa would never have crossed if it wasn't for this accident.

She would normally decline, but something makes her accept this surprising invitation.... (Source: Jmanga)
