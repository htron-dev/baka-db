In occupied France, where there was no longer the two sides could engage in combat - and the German troops invaded northern Africa after the failure of the Italian army at the Battle of Beda Fomm. The African campaign had lasted three years and was crucial to take the Suez Canal and protect Egypt - then a British protectorate. The British - at the time isolated in their own country against a long air offensive Germanic - had to settle for a passive strategy, attacking the Germans where to attack. In this context, General Montgomery gathered a large army of British, Australians, South Africans, Indians and French who rebelled against the Nazi occupation.\n\nFour clashes happen. The first Battle of El Alamein ended in a stalemate, with many killed on both sides. The Battle of Marsa Matruh, in defense of the Suez Canal, finished with a Nazi victory, forcing the remaining troops to take refuge in El Alamein, where were the other troops - leading to a quick British victory at the Battle of Alam Halfa. Now the two sides were tied - and on 23 October, came the Second Battle of El Alamein, where happen the first major upset in the history of the Second World War.",
