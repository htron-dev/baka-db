## Sinopse

Sally was a tomboy and mischievous witch girl. One day, she was attracted by an advertising balloon, and went to the department store. There she found girls of the same age, Sumire and Yoshiko, and she wanted to become friends with them. After she became good friends with them, she made up her mind to pretend to be a human and began to live in the town with her follower, Kabu. Then she began to know more important things than magic.
