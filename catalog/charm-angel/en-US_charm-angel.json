Lucky for her, Amy might just get her wish, in the form of two angels crashing through her bedroom window. The angels, Licole and Lumiere, tell Amy that she has been chosen to compete against other angels for the title of \"Star Angel\". Whoever becomes the Star Angel gets a wish granted!\n(From Nagareboshi Manga)",
