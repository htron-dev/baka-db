## Sinopse

Monarchy laid extinct in Korea since long ago, but what if Korea had continued monarchism? What if all the beautiful abandoned palaces were still actually filled with the royal families? What if the royal families continued with the normal royal customs? Welcome to the world where Korea never ended monarchism! Che-Gyeong, the high-school girl protagonist, ends up in a tragic moment in time when it has been found out that she has been promised in marriage (by her grandfather) to the current prince...who's actually not at all what he seems to be from his good looks—in one word, he's a big jerk.
