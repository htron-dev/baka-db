## Sinopse

The stage is the eve of the French Revolution. There is the commoner Gideon, who wants to save the impoverished country side-by-side with the members of the Estates General. Then there is the aristocrat, Georges, who will use any means to achieve his purpose. A man who wants to change the country, and a man who wants to destroy it. Both begin their journey forward. Will their joint efforts of love and hatred, justice and evil lead them to a hell of bloodshed, or an ideal future?
