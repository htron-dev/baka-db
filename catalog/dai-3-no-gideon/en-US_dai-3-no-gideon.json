Then there is the aristocrat, Georges, who will use any means to achieve his purpose. A man who wants to change the country, and a man who wants to destroy it. Both begin their journey forward. Will their joint efforts of love and hatred, justice and evil lead them to a hell of bloodshed, or an ideal future?\n\n(Source: Batoto)",
