## Sinopse

Takara is a Romancer, a being that can make words come to life. In his case, he can make any "lie" a lie in real life. He uses his special talent to help people while searching for others like him, but when he saved his cop friend Wakisaka, his powers were strengthened and Takara's powers changed so he could use them when he is deeply moved.
