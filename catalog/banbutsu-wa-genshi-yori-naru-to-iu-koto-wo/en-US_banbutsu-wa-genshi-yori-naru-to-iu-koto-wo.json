He is a really good jockey but nobody except his sister seems to care. When Shuuya is in France he meets the world-class jockey Jean-Paul and there is a certain attraction between the two men from the start. Gradually a love-relationship starts, but one of the more complicated kind.\n\n(Source: PRISMS)",
