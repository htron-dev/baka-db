## Sinopse

Hiyama, a very close friend of Shuuya died. Shuuya is devastated. Not only because his friend died, also because his father doesn't recognize him as what he is after all. He is a really good jockey but nobody except his sister seems to care. When Shuuya is in France he meets the world-class jockey Jean-Paul and there is a certain attraction between the two men from the start. Gradually a love-relationship starts, but one of the more complicated kind.
