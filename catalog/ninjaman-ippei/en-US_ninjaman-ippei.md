## Sinopse

Way out in the sticks, the fourth-graders of the local school in Tokio village all have their own superpowers of doubtful merit, including flying eyeballs and missile-hair. Ippei and his friends study hard to be ninjas, but they are constantly under treat from the arrogant cheats from the neighbouring village of Techno.

A strange mix of ninjas and school comedy, based on a children's manga by Kawai Kazuyoshi.
