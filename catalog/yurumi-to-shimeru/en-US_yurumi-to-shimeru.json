    "sinopse": "The Mukai siblings, Sunao and Ai, were having a normal day, when suddenly, a space ship suddenly fell into the yard of their house!? What came from within the ship was a little girl who called herself Yurumi. \"We're from the cosmic repair shop, 'Rutsubo Mechanic Company,'\" said another girl, Yurumi's partner, Shimeru, who stepped out afterwards.\nAnd so, in the Mukai household, a comedy of cosmic proportions unfolds!\n\n(Source: MU)",
