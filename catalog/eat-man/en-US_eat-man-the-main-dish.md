## Sinopse

Yoshitomi Akihito revisits the Eat-Man universe 11 years after its last publication. This time a vast amount of time have passed since the previous installment, and the civilizations he visited in the prequel have since long turned into dust, and Crank Bolt is the only surviving link to that distant past, in a post-apocalyptic desert full of mysteries.
