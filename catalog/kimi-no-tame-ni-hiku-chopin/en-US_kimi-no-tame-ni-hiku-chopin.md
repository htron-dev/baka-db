## Sinopse

Our protagonist, Aine, met Hiroshi by chance when she was very little, and she remembers even now how much fun she had listening to his piano performance. She has always dreamt of meeting him again, but when she does, he is called "The Piano Prince" and seems very hard to approach. And then, before her appears the spirit of Chopin himself! He will make the wheel of fate turn for the two main characters!
