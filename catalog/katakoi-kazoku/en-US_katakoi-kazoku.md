## Sinopse

Takatou Shinobu, brother-lover, 25 years old.

Living under the same roof are his older brother, Masaki, and nephew, Kazuomi.

Kazuomi is a troublemaker who is suspicious about Shinobu's familial love for his father, and always bullies Shinobu when Masaki isn't around. And to top it off, he even does something like that…!
