## Sinopse

The comic story of Shizuka, the eldest daughter, who lives at home, showing no signs of getting married; her mother, who is both annoyed with Shizuka, and at the same time concerned about her window of eligibility; her sister Ikumi, with whom she gets along, even though they fight; and her father, who feels henpecked in this all-female household.

The strange incidents that happen with this family, which otherwise seems completely ordinary, will make you laugh out loud. The original manga is currently serialized in Takeshobo's Manga Club.

The title is a pun on the long running Nippon Animation version of Little Women, "Ai no Wakakusa Monogatari."
