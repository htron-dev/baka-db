His only hobby is taking pictures of things he finds 'nice' with his cell phone. Upon entering high-school, he is taking pictures of some Cherry Blossoms, when he sees a strange foreign girl and accidently snaps a picture of her. And thus begins Takeru's interesting new high school life.\n\n(Source: MU)",
