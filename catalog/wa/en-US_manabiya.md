## Sinopse

Takeru, who just graduated from middle school, learns that his father has suddenly remarried. While being happy for him, Takeru leads, what he believes to be a boring life. His only hobby is taking pictures of things he finds 'nice' with his cell phone. Upon entering high-school, he is taking pictures of some Cherry Blossoms, when he sees a strange foreign girl and accidently snaps a picture of her. And thus begins Takeru's interesting new high school life.
