## Sinopse

Nami has passed the super difficult high school exam in order to meet the generous person who had helped her in the haunted house in the past. However, it turned out that he was the infamous almighty cold-blooded king, Haruka Sakuragi. On top of that, even before Nami had the chance to confess her feelings, she became the 100th girl to be rejected by him! But she’s prepared to put up a fight. A war over love is about to begin!
