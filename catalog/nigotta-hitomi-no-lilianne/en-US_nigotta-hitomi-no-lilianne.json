    "sinopse": "After coming out of a tunnel... it was pitch dark. When I awoke, it was pitch dark. First, I need to grasp the situation... While lost in thought, white, foggy figures appeared, and as usual, it was utterly dark. Just what is happening?\n\nWhen I noticed, I reincarnated! Moreover, my gender has changed!? Wouldn't you usually get a cheat ability when reincarnating!? God! Isn't this conversely a start with a handicap!\n\n\\*This is a heartwarming story of a little carefree girl.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
