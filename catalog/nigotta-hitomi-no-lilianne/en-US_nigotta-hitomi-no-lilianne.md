## Sinopse

After coming out of a tunnel... it was pitch dark. When I awoke, it was pitch dark. First, I need to grasp the situation... While lost in thought, white, foggy figures appeared, and as usual, it was utterly dark. Just what is happening?

When I noticed, I reincarnated! Moreover, my gender has changed!? Wouldn't you usually get a cheat ability when reincarnating!? God! Isn't this conversely a start with a handicap!

\*This is a heartwarming story of a little carefree girl.
