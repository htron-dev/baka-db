It's rumored that students there have a 120% chance of losing their virginity before graduating, but when Shouta arrives, he finds himself in Class G: a class made up of delinquents, nerds, and losers! Girls won't give the Class G students the time of day, but Shouta won't give up on his dreams of getting a girlfriend without a fight.",
