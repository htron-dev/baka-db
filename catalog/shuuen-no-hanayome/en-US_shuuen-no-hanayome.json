    "sinopse": "It's been years since the threat \"Kihei\" suddenly emerged and laid waste to the world. As a countermeasure, the human race established the Institute of Magic, Twilight Academy, where battles continued day and night. On one fateful day, Kaguro Kou, a member of the Magic Research Department, traveled to a certain ruin to retrieve a Kihei corpse, and unfortunately his life was...extinguished. Until a strange girl saved him...\n\n\"Greetings, my dearest, my name is Shirahime. From here on, I will be with you forever.\"\n\nLike a knight in a fairy tale, waking the princess from her slumber. Little did he know that it would be the beginning of a never-ending hell...\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
