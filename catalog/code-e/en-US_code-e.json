    "sinopse": "Chinami Ebihara is girl with a strange ability to generate electromagnetic waves when her emotions run high. However, since this \"ability\" affects anything electrical, it resulted in her having to transfer from school to school when she was younger. As Chinami, now 18 years of age, transfers to a new school, she once again affects the electronic devices in the school, but this time, when another student, Kotaro Kannagi, sees her do this, he becomes obsessed in studying her \"TYPE-E\" ability.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
