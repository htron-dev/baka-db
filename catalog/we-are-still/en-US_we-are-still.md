## Sinopse

Doe-won is about to enter high school. She\'s ready to face her new school and her new classmates, but then she meets the class representative, Baek Joon, who chooses the seat next to her rather than a seat somewhere else. Why does Baek Joon seem so interested in her? And why is Doe-won so nervous to see Eun Eegi, who demands something of her that she thought he had forgotten...!?
