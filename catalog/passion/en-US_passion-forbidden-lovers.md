## Sinopse

Based on the manga of the same title, Passion tells the story of senior high schooler Hikaru Umino who is desperately in love with his teacher, Kuniaki Shima. When he hears a rumor that Shima is engaged to be married, Hikaru does the unthinkable and forces himself upon his teacher. Shima makes him atone for his sin in an unexpected way; he want Hikaru to be hi "make-believe" lover until Hikaru graduates from high school.

When the time limit expires, can Hikaru let go of his beloved teacher? And is Shima as indifferent as Hikaru believe him to be? Are Hikaru's passionate feelings really not reaching his teacher?
