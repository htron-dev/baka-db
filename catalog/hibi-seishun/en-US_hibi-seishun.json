    "sinopse": "Yuki starts her first year of high school. As an ex-delinquent, she feels a certain culpability about her past, and it's not without a reason: she lost the mobility of her right arm. To worsen the situation, one of her classmate, Chio, is making advances to her, while she isn't interested even in love.\n\nAll she wants is to prove the \"value of her life,\" but why? And for whom?\n\n(Source: Akata Manga)",
