## Sinopse

"You have a nice body." With that, the associate professor offers him a part time job... looking after him......! Shattered by the losses of his two-year relationship and nine-year job, Asahi has nowhere to go. But when his father is hospitalized, he ends up helping at his parents' restaurant.

There, he meets professor Yuzuru Togame, who is slouching and scoffing down his food. Despite being seven years Asahi's senior, Yuzuru turns out to be pretty hopeless as he eats with his chopsticks clenched in his fist, and then falls asleep mid-meal! Asahi accepts Yuzuru's offer of a part-time job without much thought, but......!?

This is a case study in love, between a broken-hearted but meddlesome younger man, and a hapless professor.
