## Sinopse

Based off of The Song of the Nibelungs comes a manga about bravery, honor, and heroism. As the last of his people, Siegfried will stop at nothing until he becomes a legendary knight whose story will last eternity. If his legend lives on forever, then so will the memory of his people...and that is his sole reason for going on.
