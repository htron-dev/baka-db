    "sinopse": "Nagaoka Sachiko is a 27 year old woman whose live-in boyfriend abruptly left her. A coworker drags her out to a club to meet some fresh men. She bumps into an older man who turns out to be the fairly popular DJ. They talk and get to know each other a bit. However, Sachiko doesn’t realize she’s already met this man--by day, he is her incredibly awkward and bizarrely dressed boss.\n\n(Source: the manga habit)",
