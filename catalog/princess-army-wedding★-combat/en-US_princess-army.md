## Sinopse

Once upon a time, there was a little girl. One day she played a trick on a drunk and made him angry. The drunk was going to hurt her, until a boy appeared and saved her. It's been eleven years since that incident, but Nonoka is still looking for the "prince" who saved her.
This manga's got a love triangle and lots of judo!
