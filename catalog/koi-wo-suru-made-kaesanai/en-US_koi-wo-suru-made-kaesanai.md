## Sinopse

I'm always into trouble since you’re impertinent, a bit perverted but cute.
My mind is driving me mad by being attracted to a handsome youth who is 4 years younger than me!
Please teach me!!

On the hinge of recession, Tamako joins a household chores company, "Smile Maid". Having an affair will make her lose her job. Uehara is her next job place, and its only son, Yuu-kun tells her that he knows how to cover the affair.
The partner who will evaluate her works is a high school student who always makes Tamako’s heart skip a beat!!
