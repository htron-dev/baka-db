    "sinopse": "Perry lives a quiet life in London. But when the man she's just started dating starts talking about their future together, she knows she must take action. The truth is, she got married when she was eighteen years old. The marriage was for their mutual benefit and really only exists on paper. They've both kept it a secret. Perry must get a divorce asap, but she can't get a hold of her successful businessman \"husband,\" Nash. Letters and emails go unanswered as the days pass. And then she sees Nash on the news announcing that he's seeking a court-mediated settlement with his wife!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
