## Sinopse

A man was about to commit suicide and decides to search for a way to die in the internet, but then he found an odd site that asked a lot of questions and had a point based system that allows you to create skills and abilities for a character. He took interest in it and when he finished setting his character he was asked "You will now be transported to a world with the settings you choose, coming back is not possible, do you still accept." Then, without thinking much of it, he pressed "YES," and he found himself in another world with the skills and abilities he choose to have.
