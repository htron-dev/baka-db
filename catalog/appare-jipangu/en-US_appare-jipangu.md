## Sinopse

Yusura is a ‘Hikeshi-ya’, a ‘Sadness Fighter’. She carries a staff called Kongomaru that can absorb people’s sadness and turn blue, then turn the sadness into energy. Using Kongomaru, she helps to solve people’s problems (for a small fee, of course), accompanied by her sidekick Minekichi, a young man named Samon, and a ninja, Kazenosuke—and all the while she tries to find clues to the whereabouts of her real parents.
