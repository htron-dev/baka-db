## Sinopse

Sako is a young college girl who gets her thrills stealing money from guys she drugs during "compensated dates." Together with her lacky, a nerdy-looking boy named Kinoko, Sako comes across Honoka, a girl touring Tokyo who looks exactly like her. However, powerful forces had been working behind the scenes to keep the two lookalikes apart.
