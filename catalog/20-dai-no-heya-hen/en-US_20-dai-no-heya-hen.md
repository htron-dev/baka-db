## Sinopse

An advertisement for MyNavi Chintai (MyNavi Rental) that began airing on television on January 10, 2015.

The "20-dai no Heya-hen" (Rooms for Twentysomethings) commercial shows how the MyNavi Chintai service lets young people find living spaces that fit their different lifestyles. The characters profiled include a man living alone who searched for a place "near the station," a woman with a dog who searched for an apartment that "allows pets," a couple who searched for a place "for two," and a woman searching for a room on the service.
