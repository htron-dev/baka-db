    "sinopse": "This is an SBS Drama Special. Kang Jin's Family moves to Sancheong with a past lingering over their shoulders. As they arrive in town, banners hanging over the streets are forbidding them from passing through the streets because of their luggage in the back of the trunk. Something about the banner really ticks off Kang Jin's Mom. As crazy as she is, what does she do? And what lies ahead in Sancheong? This is a tragic love story of sweet descendants.\n\n(Source: Eclipse Scans)",
