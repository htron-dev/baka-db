## Sinopse

"When I got fired from my job, I went to a different world..."

Fujioka Noelle is a hard worker for a black company, but her efforts go unrewarded when she is handed a notice of dismissal one day. Frustrated and sinking into despair, she was suddenly transported to another world...

In front of the bewildered Noelle appeared Fenrir, the large, silvery-white wolf. Taking a liking to her, they took her into their care as their 'beloved daughter.' Before long, in the midst of her healing, she became caught up in events that will change the world...
