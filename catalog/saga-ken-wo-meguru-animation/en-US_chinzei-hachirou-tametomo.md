## Sinopse

Kamimine Town, located in the eastern part of Saga Prefecture, is a place associated with the legendary military commander Minamoto no Tametomo, who is said to be "Yoshitsune in the east, Tametomo in the west."

Here, he called himself "Hachirou Chinzei" and built a castle. Chinzei and his army is said to have defeated 50,000 enemies, and many legends were left behind.

A master of bows and a big man, Chinzei had a rough temper and was even called a violent person by nature. But he was also a person with warmth and kindness full of humanity.
