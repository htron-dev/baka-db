## Sinopse

After a night of serious boozing, a jilted young man named Ryuka speaks his wish for true love atop a starlit hill. His words reach the ears of Ixto, the spirit of the last quarter moon, who decides to grant Ryuka's wish. Unfortunately for Ryuka, Ixto's handpicked selections to be the young man's lover are all men themselves! And when his rejection of these choices leads to an unexpected night of passion that casts a spell on him, will Ryuka give in to his enchanted body's urge to chase after Ixto and journey through worlds unknown, or will his mind win over his heart?
