## Sinopse

The "Dead Zone" is a place only the dead can see. But there are a few special people with the ability to step into that zone and make the stories of the dead into artwork. They are called Croquers, and Da-Il is one of them. The only problem is that he does not realize his power yet. As he starts his first day as an assistant of manhwa artist Go-Ho, he has his first experience in the "Dead Zone."
