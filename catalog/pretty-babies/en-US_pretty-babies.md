## Sinopse

Young rookie detective gets assigned to a surly yakuza investigator who wants nothing to do with him. Chikara's persistence to help Ibuki in his investigations leads him to follow Ibuki late one night. Chikara sees Ibuki and 3 others carrying a large wrapped bundle out of a church, which he thinks might be a body. Dazed as he makes his way home Chikara almost gets hit by a car. Next thing he knows Chikara finds himself in a hotel room with the dazzlingly gorgeous driver about to experience his first taste of male on male pleasures.
