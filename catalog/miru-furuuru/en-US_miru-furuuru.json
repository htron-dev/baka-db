    "sinopse": "Five years ago, Chika received flower seeds from a “mysterious” boy, who asked her to grow them until they bloom. Five years later, the flowers have not bloomed yet, but another boy has come in front of Chika, and claimed himself as the “mysterious” boy. Is he really the boy in Chika’s memory? And will Chika be able to grow the seeds?\n\n(Source: Doko Demo Doa Manga Scanlations)",
