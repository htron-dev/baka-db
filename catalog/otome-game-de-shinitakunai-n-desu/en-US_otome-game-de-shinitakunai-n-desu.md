## Sinopse

Audrey Areinas and Flora Eurencie, two rather normal women in modern day Japan, are reincarnated into the R18 otome game "Forbidden Passion~Sweet Trap of Rape" as the supporting character and heroine respectively.

For Audrey, erotic games had been wish-fulfilling fantasies for a virgin such as herself. However, from her knowledge of the game, she knows that if she does not sleep with someone, she is doomed to die at the hands of a yandere love interest. To prevent such an unfortunate end, Audrey enlists the aid of her bodyguard Calfan to teach her bedroom manners.

On the other hand, the "romances" which await the heroine are horrifying and nonconsensual. So much so, she has been training since childhood to become stronger. As Flora nears 18 years of age, the start of the visual novel's storyline comes closer as well, and she can't seem to avoid encounters with the love interests. At least her butler Karl is not a pursuable character, and he is more than willing to help protect her innocence from any lascivious male.

Otome Game de Shinitakunai n desu follows Audrey and Flora as they navigate a treacherous world, where any man may be hiding lecherous intentions and fetishes behind handsome smiles.
