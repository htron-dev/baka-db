## Sinopse

"It's because Yuu-kun is Marika's slave!"

One day, my childhood friend Marika, whom I haven't met in four years, suddenly appeared in front of me and said that. What...?! Was her personality always like that? Actually, hold up. Ever since then, I intentionally put some distance between Marika and I... Yes, after she saw me doing that... A provocative and tantalizing heart-throb! Thus begin the battle for dominance and back-and-forth game of love!
