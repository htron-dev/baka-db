## Sinopse

At the end of his journey with the wolf goddess Holo, former traveling merchant Lawrence settled down with her and opened a bathhouse.
The couple was blessed with an adorable daughter and an idyllic life.
However, the beautiful wolves have a weakness for delicious meals and their food expenses are a source of headaches for Lawrence.
One day, as Lawrence is going about his fur side business to further fill the family's coffers, a slight incident occurs.
To further complicate things, Holo saunters in with quite the feast.

This is a VR Animation of Spice and Wolf: Spring Log, sequel to the original Spice and Wolf VR animation.
The game has a 30 minute story and a game mode where you can watch part of the anime alongside its characters in the style of Japanese paper street theater.
A peaceful life in the bathhouse with wolfgirls awaits.
You can enjoy the game and view the included anime without a VR headset in its Non-VR Mode.
