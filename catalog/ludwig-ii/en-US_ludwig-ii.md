## Sinopse

Ludwig II by You Higuri, consisting of three volumes, is a fictional manga detailing the life of the historical Mad King of Bavaria, Ludwig II. It follows his military life, while it explores obscure subjects of the man's unstable and tragic life, his conflicts with his family, and his homosexual love affairs. Serious in nature, this manga is very beautiful, elaborate, emotional, and like Seimaden, it is simply marvelous.

A new edition was published in 2 volumes.
The English edition also has 2 volumes.
