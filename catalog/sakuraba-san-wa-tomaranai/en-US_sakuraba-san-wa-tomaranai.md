Ikeda Mei, highschool first year girl with a history of having no boyfriend as long as her age. "I thought I would get a boyfriend in high school!!" While Mei was being frantic, handsome senpai Sakuraba-san suddenly appears in front of her. Even though it should be their first meeting, he confesses "…please go out with me!!!" Mei agreed on a whim but…!? Her heart won’t stop racing! Her first, exciting romance with a very biased boyfriend.
