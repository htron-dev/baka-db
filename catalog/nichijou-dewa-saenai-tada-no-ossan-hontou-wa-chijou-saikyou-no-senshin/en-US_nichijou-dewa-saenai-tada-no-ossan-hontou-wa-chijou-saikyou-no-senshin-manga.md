## Sinopse

Bar, an ordinary middle-aged mister and a veteran adventurer, lived an easy, comforting life in the Imperial Capital. He would carry items for adventuring parties or help the guild's staff from time to time.

"Mr. Bar, glad to have you today!"

"Thank you for your words."

That uncle who was liked by everyone in the capital, was actually the strongest arsenal of the Empire—one of the "Laevateinn"—Bartolomeus.

"Please step forward, Lord Bar."

With a delicate and beautiful elven girl, Welhe Mina, to back him up, his gallant figure racing across the battlefield or the political battleground was simply godly—like a War God. The heroic tales of the dowdy adventurer AND the mightiest arsenal starts here!
