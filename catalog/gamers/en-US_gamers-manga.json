    "sinopse": "The story centers on a fairly ordinary high school boy, Keita Amano. His hobby is video games, but apart from that, he has no conspicuous traits, and even never been in love. As Keita continues his gaming life, he suddenly becomes involved with the most beautiful girl at school, Tendou Karen, the president of the school's video game club. She shocks Keita when she suddenly asks him to join the video game club. Their relationship evolves and complicates as other gamers come into the picture and create misunderstandings.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)",
