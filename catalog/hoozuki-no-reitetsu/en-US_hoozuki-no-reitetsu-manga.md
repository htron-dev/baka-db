## Sinopse

Hell is a bureaucracy and business is running smoother than ever thanks to the demonic efficiency of Hoozuki, the chief deputy to Lord Enma, King of Hell. Whether it be offering counselling to Momotarou of Japanese folklore fame or receiving diplomatic missions from the Judeo-Christian hell; the man who runs the show from behind the Lord Enma's imposing shadows is ready to beat down to a bloody pulp any challenges coming his way, metaphorically of course...

As the poster boy for micromanagement and armed with negotiation skills worthy of Wall Street, days spent troubleshooting hell with the sadistic and level-headed Hoozuki are never dull. Full of familiar faces from popular Japanese legends and East Asian mythology working middle management positions, this referential and anachronistic dark comedy set in the underworld brings new meanings to the phrase employer liability. Just how hard can it be to manage employees from hell anyway?
