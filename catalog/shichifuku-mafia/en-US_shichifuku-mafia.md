## Sinopse

As a vigilante group loved by the local residents, the Alfano Family spent their days living peacefully. However, ever since the rise of a rival Mafia, dark clouds have been hovering over them. "Go to your late mother (former Yakuza)'s homeland, Japan, and bring the seven strongest people who were once her subordinates." Accepting this secret order, Leo heads to Japan. The seven people he seeks for are...the Seven Gods of Fortune that were sealed away in a hanging scroll!
