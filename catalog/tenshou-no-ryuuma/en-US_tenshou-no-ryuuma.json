    "sinopse": "At the end of the age of shogunates, a great man is given a second chance to restore a crumbling, feudal Japan.\n\nToward the end of the Edo Period, samurai and visionary Sakamoto Ryouma led a revolutionary movement to overthrow the Takagawa Shogunate. Inspired by the Western principle of \"all men created equal\", he envisioned a modern Japanese government, free of oppressive feudalism. In 1867, he and his close friend Nakaoka Shintaro were assasinated before his dreams could be realized.\n\nTenshou no Ryouma explores the historical alternative-universe where Ryouma is saved through Shintaro's sacrifice. Given this second chance, will Ryouma finally be able to establish a new, modern Japan?\n\n(Source: Easy Going Scans)",
