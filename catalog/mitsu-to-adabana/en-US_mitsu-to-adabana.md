## Sinopse

Kai Matsunaga runs his own small flower shop. Masamune Tatsumi is a man who doesn't look like he belongs among all of the roses and tulips. Though one day, Masamune walks in and, to Kai's chagrin, simply orders "white flowers." Kai's appalled at how rude and curt Masamune is, but the more they talk, the more they get to know each other. Unfortunately, Shiro Yagami is about to ruin whatever relationship they were building. He violates Kai's sweet, innocent body... but why?
