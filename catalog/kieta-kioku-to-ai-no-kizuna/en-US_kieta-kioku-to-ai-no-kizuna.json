    "sinopse": "As a child, Laura appeared on the poster of a nonprofit, and her angelic looks captured the public's imagination. Now she's an adult, and her beauty has captured the heart of millionaire Samual Bishop. But he's overprotective of her. He treats Laura so delicately, she feels like a porcelain doll. She can't tell if it's love or pity that he feels for her... so she asks for a separation. Though she loves Samuel, she doesn't know if there's a future for them. While working through her concerns, Laura slips and hits her head and suffers a spell of amnesia... taking her back to the time when she and Samuel were madly in love!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
