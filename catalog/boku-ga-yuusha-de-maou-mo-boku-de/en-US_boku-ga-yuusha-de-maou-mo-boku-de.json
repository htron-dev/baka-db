He leads a peaceful, uneventful life—but that all changes when two beautiful women approach him, each certain he's the legendary man she's been searching for! But which of them is right? Is he the hero or the demon lord? Turns out he bears the marks of both, and neither woman is willing to give him up! Wanted by the forces of good and evil, what's a guy like Yuuma to do?!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
