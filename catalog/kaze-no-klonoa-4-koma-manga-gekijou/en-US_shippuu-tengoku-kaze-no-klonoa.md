## Sinopse

Klonoa is a cat/rabbid which lives in the small and quiet town called "Breezegale." Well, it Was quiet before Klonoa moved into it!

Together with his friend, the mailman Moo, he gets into all kinds of crazy adventures! Mailbox hunting, beer drinking contests and sleeping problem solver are just some of the weird things he does! And with the always complaining Moo, things never gets boring, especially when there's reward hunters out there looking for Moo's to shoot!
