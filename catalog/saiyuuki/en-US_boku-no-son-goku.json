    "sinopse": "Boku no Son Goku (My Son Goku) was a manga created by the famous Osamu Tezuka, known as the Father of Anime, based on Journey to the West. The main plot structure is the same in that Goku wrecks havoc in heaven, gets saved by Sanzo Hoshi, and they go on a journey to fetch the scriptures, picking up Hakkai and Gojyo along the way. However, the details vary greatly from the original work and Osamu injected much of his original style and humour into the series.\n\n(Source: vbtutor.net/xiyouji/manga.htm)",
