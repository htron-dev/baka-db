    "sinopse": "Soft, squishy, and adorable three-year-old Alice Rebecca Archelaus is the beloved daughter of her grand household. However, when this innocent child learns she is merely a replacement for the real \"Alice\" who died at birth, she falls into a state of profound depression, and her household teeters on the brink of collapse.\n\nTwo years later, Alice awakens from her despair, but not as a regular child. Instead, she regains her memories from her past life, those of a 30-year-old corporate slave and fantasy otaku in Japan! Now living in her dream world of magic and monsters, Alice employs her middle-aged wisdom and revitalized spirit to tackle her most pressing issues and, of course, master some magic along the way.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
