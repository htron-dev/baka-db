## Sinopse

Taki Kanon and Nakamori Ryou met through a piano in their first year of high school. Nakamori played video game songs beautifully, while Taki's talent lay in piano tuning. They were in the same class, and they spent a lot of time together at a piano. But shyness and misunderstanding plagued the formation of a more serious relationship. Over the years, will they be able to find a way to make the paths of their lives finally converge?
