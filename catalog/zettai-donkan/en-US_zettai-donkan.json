    "sinopse": "Taki Kanon and Nakamori Ryou met through a piano in their first year of high school. Nakamori played video game songs beautifully, while Taki's talent lay in piano tuning. They were in the same class, and they spent a lot of time together at a piano. But shyness and misunderstanding plagued the formation of a more serious relationship.
