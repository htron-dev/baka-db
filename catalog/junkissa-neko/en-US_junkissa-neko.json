    "sinopse": "After failing his college exam, Nishikori Kon took his pet cat and fled. He ended up going from Kyoto to Mount Hakodate in Hokkaido. At his wits end, he was picked up by a young man named Tachikawa Ayakane, who hired him on the spot to work at his and his brothers' café (though his older brother hates the word 'café') \"Coffee & Cat.\" It turns out Ayakane was so impressed with Kon's pet cat's appearance that he wanted him to get the unkempt 5 cats of the establishment in order. Now Kon serves all the cats, but he has a secret the brothers don't know. Kon can actually see cats as human beings and understand their speech! Kon and his pet cat's new lifestyle is just beginning!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
