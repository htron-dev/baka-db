## Sinopse

That was the highest fever I never had. Because of those guys. When I entered in high school I met the team of “tsubasa ga oka D.C” Those guy were so problematic but looked like Host! That’s what I thought at the beginning...

“...bet with us Alice, bet with us!”
“I’m going to ridicule you guys!”
“Let’s make a deal. If I lose, you’ll have my first kiss”

If it’s Takeru-kun, I can bet anything. I can give him every “first things” of my life.
