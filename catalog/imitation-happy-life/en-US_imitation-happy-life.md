## Sinopse

A cram school teacher, Uno, reunites with his former student and lover, Someya. Uno, who couldn't throw away his feelings for Someya, accepts his proposal to "be in a no-strings attached lover's relationship" and sleeps with him. The two spend their days peacefully and happily like the time when they were lovers. Then, by chance, he happens to witness Someya entering a love hotel with a woman. Uno presses for the truth, but senses something wrong with Someya's reaction...
