## Sinopse

Aikawa doesn't expect to make many friends in high school due to his large size, attitude and the scar on his face. He doesn't avoid making friends with people, but he doesn't go seeking them out either. A boy in his class, Kisaki Taichi, seems to initially want to be his friend, but then he steps completely over that boundary when he confesses his love.

Aikawa is shocked, and tries to avoid the issue of homosexuality by using his continuing attachment to his first love, a girl named Suzuka, as a rejection technique. This backfires when Kisaki claims that he actually is Suzuka. He claims that he had been cross-dressing back then, and now his family name has changed due to his parents' divorce and remarriage. Will Aikawa still love this new Suzuka?
