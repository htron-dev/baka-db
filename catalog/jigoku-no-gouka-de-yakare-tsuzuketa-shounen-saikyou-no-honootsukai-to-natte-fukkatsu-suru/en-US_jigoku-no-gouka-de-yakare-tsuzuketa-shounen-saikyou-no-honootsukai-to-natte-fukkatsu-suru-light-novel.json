    "sinopse": "\"Hellfire\"—once sealed unquenchable fire, whose fierce flames can burn the entire world to the ground. Flare is an ordinary guy who lives in a border village and is sacrificed to an out-of-control fire. Experiencing inhuman torments in the hellfire, he would seem to have no chance of surviving...\n\nBut wait a minute! Is he not dying? Had he endured the fury of hellfire? Flare literally rose from the ashes and returned to the world of the living, gaining the ability to control the \"Hellfire!\" This is a fantasy story about the travels of a free hero who conquered the flame and cheated death itself!\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
