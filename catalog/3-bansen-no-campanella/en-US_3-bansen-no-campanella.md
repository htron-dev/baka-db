## Sinopse

“To reach the truest happiness, one must make their way through many sorrows.”—Night on the Galactic Railroad, Kenji Miyazawa.

Kanou was once madly in love. Being in a committed relationship, the last thing he expected was to be suddenly dumped.

A year later, Kanou feels like he is barely living. He stands on the train platform before work—depressed, lonely, and completely at a loss. One day, his intentions are misinterpreted and a high school student attempts to save him from committing potential suicide, leading Kanou to grow hopeful once again.

Echoing the heroism of Campanella, a character from Kanou's favorite novel Night on the Galactic Railroad, this young boy has saved him. But will his actions give Kanou the drive to finally face his problems—from the pain associated with his ex-boyfriend to the complicated relationships emerging at his workplace?
