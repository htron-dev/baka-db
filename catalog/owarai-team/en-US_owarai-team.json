    "sinopse": "When Ken's father successfully constructs a fully automated robot, Ken decides to take it for a spin with his pet cat, Mike.\nIn a totally nonsensical chain of events, the robot crash lands on the mysterious \"Pologon Island\" where Ken and Mike discover a strange rock that can float on water and swerve in mid-air.\n\nAfter arriving home, Ken shows the stone to his father who immediately recognizes it to be nothing more than bird poop.\n\nSoon after, Ken and his cat find themselves accosted by a group of hostile Kappa before having their bellybuttons stolen. The only way to recover their stolen navels is by beating the cunning Kappa in a game of baseball!\n\nKen soon rounds up a ridiculous bunch of players including a baby and a wooden doll and, with the help of his magical bird poop, sets about reclaiming his stolen bellybutton!\n\nWritten just 6 months into Shigeru Mizuki's career as a Manga artist, this is a highly unusual and much sought after comedy gem from the 1950's rental comic book era.",
