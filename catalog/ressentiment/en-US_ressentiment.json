    "sinopse": "A story set in the near future, about a middle-aged loser whose only refuge is a virtual bishoujo game.\n\nTakurou, the main character, is a stereotyped, low self esteem, adult male in a dead end job. Because he feels he has nothing to live for, he let himself go, becoming fat, miserable, and lonely. The only shining thing he lives for is the occasional visit to a brothel where his savings will allow him to at least not be completely sexless. This is when, through a real life friend of his, he is introduced to the virtual reality world of \"The Unreal.\" Where, after spending $6000+ on equipment, you can purchase a virtual girlfriend who only thinks of you. Only the girl, Tsukiko, that Takurou purchases, seems to have come with a few defects.\n\n(Source: MU)",
