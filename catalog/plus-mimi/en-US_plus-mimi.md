## Sinopse

Kise Nanami, your average high school boy, had quite the ordeal returning to normalcy when his meddling father accidentally gave him animal ears. Finally, Nanami is back to being his plain-old, ear-less self.

Until recently, he'd never been good around women, let alone talk to one! But, thanks to fellow classmate and secret crush, Kuroda, also ending up cursed with animal ears, the two have managed a few conversations, at least.

Will Nanami's high school life finally pan out like he wants? Or is he going to be constantly plagued by these odd, bodily changes forever?
