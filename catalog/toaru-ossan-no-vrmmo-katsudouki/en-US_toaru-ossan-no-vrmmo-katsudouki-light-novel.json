    "sinopse": "Typical company employee Tanaka Daichi (38-years-old, single) loves games and plays a new type of VRMMO called \"One More Free Life Online\" under the username \"Earth.\" Inside this free world he chose several skills that are generally regarded as useless. Be it wasting time crafting potions, cooking up pointlessly tasty food, or hunting monsters with some absurd weapon he crafted, he simply enjoys playing the game.\n\n(Source: MU)",
