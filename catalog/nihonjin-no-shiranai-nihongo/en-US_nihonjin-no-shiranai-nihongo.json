    "sinopse": "An illustrated collection of stories about a Japanese teacher in Japan chronicling the difficulties and experiences she faces when interacting with her students. Much of it talks about the misuse of the Japanese language (even by native speakers) and attempts to present the rectified form to the reader, but apart from that, there is also a lot of interesting information about the language itself and its roots.\n\n(Source: MU)",
