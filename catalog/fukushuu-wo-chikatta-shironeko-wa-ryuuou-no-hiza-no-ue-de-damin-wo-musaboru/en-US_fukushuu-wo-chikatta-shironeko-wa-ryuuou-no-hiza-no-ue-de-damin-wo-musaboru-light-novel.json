To make matters somehow worse, a mysterious conspiracy then gets her abandoned in a perilous forest.\n\nThrough an unexpected turn of events, she comes into possession of a mystical bracelet that allows her to transform into a white cat. Now that she's in the Land of the Dragon King, she has to hide the fact that she's human—which means spending her days as a little white cat, for the time being... But how will she exact her much-earned revenge against those who’ve wronged her while stuck in the form of a small, fluffy, cuddly kitty cat?!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",
