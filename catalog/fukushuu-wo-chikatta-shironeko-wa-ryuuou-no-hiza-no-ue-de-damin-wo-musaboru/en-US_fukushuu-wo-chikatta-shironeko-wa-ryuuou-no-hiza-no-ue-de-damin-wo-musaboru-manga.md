## Sinopse

With her silky blonde hair and large blue eyes, Ruri Morikawa should have been the most beautiful and popular girl. However, she has never been quite so fortunate; her oblivious "best friend" Asahi Shinomiya has somehow always stolen the spotlight, causing others to detest the Ruri who Asahi cherishes. When they are summoned to another world, this cycle repeats once again, and Ruri is ultimately banished.

Alone in the wilderness, Ruri stumbles upon a cottage in a neighboring kingdom. There, she learns that she is someone "beloved by the spirits": a person whose mere existence can shake countries to the core and instigate bloody wars. Along with the cute fairies that follow her wherever she goes, she gains a magic bracelet that can transform her into a fluffy white cat. Hoping to learn more about the world, Ruri travels to the capital and receives direct protection from the Dragon King Jade.

The two begin to foster a close bond, even though he thinks that she is only a cat! As Ruri struggles with the lie she has fallen into, a war is brewing between the Dragon King's army and the one led by the figurehead Priestess Asahi.
