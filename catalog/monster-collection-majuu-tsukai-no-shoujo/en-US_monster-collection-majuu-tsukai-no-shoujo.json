When disaster strikes, her principal chooses her to avert it.\n\nJoined by an unusual crew of allies both human and not, Kasche must recapture the relic from an evil summoner before he can use it to unlock the ancient Encyclopedia Verum and call up the most powerful monsters ever seen!\n\n(Source: CMX)",
