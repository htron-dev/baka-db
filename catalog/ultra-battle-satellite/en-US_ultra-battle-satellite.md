## Sinopse

UBS: Ultra Battle Satellite, a reality show program in real time where several fighters win awards by the heads of other fighters. The more victories accumulate, the more money will but increasingly their reward will increase to defeat you. No rules, no law and no mercy! Obviously, we are not responsible for any, bruised, cut, fracture, injury or perhaps death...

Say gold attracts strong. This is an absolute truth for all ages and cultures.

And it's the same for the battles!

Included one-shots:
Volume 2: Abare Mashira (Rampage Mashira; pilot)
Volume 3: Kyoufu! Seishin Shishikai no Yabou (2 parts)
