## Sinopse

Photographer Emma was betting on this job to make her sister's dream come true. If she can get an interview with Nikolai's family in Russia, then her chance might come. But Nikolai immediately captivates her heart and they spend a night together. He tells her about his family's unhappy past, but later Nikolai wonders if she went as far as to sleep with him just for an article. Emma gives up on their ephemeral love, but what will happen when Nikolai learns that she's carrying his child?
