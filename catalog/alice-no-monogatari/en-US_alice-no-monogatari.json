    "sinopse": "Officially, I deal in stocks. My partner, a highly advanced A.I. named Alice, and I constantly monitor current events and search through the news to find information that might be lurking beneath the official story. I’ve had my eye on a particular brand for a while now, and we have been following it closely. I thought things were going pretty well, however… One day, as I was leaving my room, I had the strange feeling somebody was watching me. Turning back to look, I saw Alice’s hologram still active. Usually, she turns herself off before I even get to the door… But today, she just stood there, staring intently at me.\n\n(Source: BookWalker)",
