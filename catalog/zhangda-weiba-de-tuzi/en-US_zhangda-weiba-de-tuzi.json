    "sinopse": "One of the little white rabbits was ridiculed for having a short and small tail, so he fitted himself with a long tail. Once, the little white rabbit was chased by a fox while playing in the forest. Because of his long tail, the little white rabbit couldn't run fast and couldn't get rid of the fox. It was not until he lost his long tail that he successfully escaped from the danger.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
