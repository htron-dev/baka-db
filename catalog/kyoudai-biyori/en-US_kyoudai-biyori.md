## Sinopse

After his parents go overseas for a few months to work, Kouta, a college student, gets to live in the family house again with his brother Tetsurou, who came back from Tokyo to keep him company. Kouta hasn't seen his big brother for six years, and doesn't really get along with him. The situation soon gets awkward when Kouta realizes he doesn't know anything about his brother... And it gets worse when he becomes aware that the antipathy he felt towards him, might be more ambiguous than he previously thought...
