    "sinopse": "In a European school dorm, Georges Saphir is admired and loved by everyone. However, afraid of others doing him harm, he has never allowed anyone to get close. Why is it then that misfit Robert can effortlessly step over this line Georges has drawn, and see right through him? And will getting too close to Robert result in a tragedy that justifies his worst fears? (Source: DMP)",
