In order to write a successful story, this totally uncool, downright ugly guy decides the best way to really understand girls... is to brave the world of host clubs! The events of this manga are based on the (shy, non-drinking) author's own experiences working as a host! No matter what you've heard about host clubs, this \"50% true\" comedy is a story you won't want to miss!\n\n(Source: Manga Box)",
