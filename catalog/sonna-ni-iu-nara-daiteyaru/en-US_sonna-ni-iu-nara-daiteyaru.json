    "sinopse": "An average office drone by day and gay-magnet playboy by night, Shinobu Urakawa was living it up as a \"top\" without anybody knowing about his double life. Or that's how it was supposed to be. Suddenly, the narcissist Prince of the sales department, Hikaru Omoteya, appears at the gay bar Shinobu frequents. With a half-baked plan to be popular with guys too, Hikaru's invasion of Shinobu's favourite haunt is getting in the way of his game. So to regain his oasis, Shinobu decides to make a move on Hikaru: \"You've been waiting, right? For me to hit on you, that is.\"\n\n(Source: Takeshobo, translated)",
