## Sinopse

Naoyuki Hasegawa, 37 years old. His work is perfect, but by contrast, in his private life, he's become aware that he's gotten out of shape. Satoshi Katagiri, 30 years old. Handsome, smart, good personality, likes both men and women, a prince admired by all at his company. Or he should have been. He stole money from a university student, and he destroyed the car of a man he didn't like. And secretly, he's totally bankrupt?! One night in a park, Hasegawa meets the Katagiri that nobody knows!
