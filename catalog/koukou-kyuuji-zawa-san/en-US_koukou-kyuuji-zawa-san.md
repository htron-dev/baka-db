## Sinopse

A Slice-of-Life, Comedy, Sports manga about a girl, often called as Zawa (short for her surname, Miyakozawa), in a high-school baseball team. She's talented, but being a girl, she doesn't get to participate in any official matches, and yet she trains just as hard as the rest of the team anyway, just for her own personal satisfaction.

Chapters are short and frequently done from the perspective of some passer-by/s interacting with or even just watching and contemplating to themselves about Zawa and/or the rest of the baseball team.
