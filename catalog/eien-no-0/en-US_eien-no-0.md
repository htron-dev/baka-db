## Sinopse

Kentarou, 26 years, is a NEET. At the request of his sister Keiko, the young man plunges into his family past. Kyuuzou Miyabe, his grandfather, was a fighter pilot of the Japanese imperial navy who had fought at the commands of the mythical Japanese fighter aircraft: "Zero." But at the end of the war, he dies in a kamikaze attack. Was he the hero whom everybody claims? Or rather a terrorist? A coward?
