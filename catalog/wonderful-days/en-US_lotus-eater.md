## Sinopse

Rihito promised himself that he’d never fall in love with a hetero or bisexual. However when Rihito’s shop manager, Kanda Kouji, confessed to him, he allowed Kanda to hold him. Ri-chan made it clear to Kanda that it’s impossible between them. But with Kanda’s continuous advances, will Ri-chan give in? (Source: Attractive Fascinante)
