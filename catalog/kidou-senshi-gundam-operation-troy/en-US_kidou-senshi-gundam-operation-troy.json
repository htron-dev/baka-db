    "sinopse": "The story of Kidou Senshi Gundam: Operation:Troy opens with the space colonists' brutal battle for independence from The Earth Federation. Advanced ECM has rendered range sensors and communications useless, resulting in the rise of new war machines called mobile suits. These ultimate instruments of destruction, capable of metal-clashing hand-to-hand combat, completely redefine modern warfare.\n\n(Source: Gundam Wikia)",
