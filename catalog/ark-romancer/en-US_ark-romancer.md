After experiencing tragedy firsthand, Amagi Souji does not feel that he is deserving of love or of loving anyone. It is not until a strange girl appears before him wanting to learn just what love is that he finds himself caught up in a battle between female warriors known as "Ark Processors." Will he learn to feel love again and will he be able to teach her what true love is?! Only time can tell!
