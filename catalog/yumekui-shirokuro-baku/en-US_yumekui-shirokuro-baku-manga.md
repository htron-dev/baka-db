## Sinopse

Miku has loved singing since she was little. She earned a magnificent victory in her audition and stepped into the world of idols. Finally, she became a top idol, but the office she belongs to has forbidden any kind of romance. Soon, Miku starts to wish that she could fall in love like a normal girl. Then, one day, she meets a mysterious boy named Len in a dream... The motif to this story is the Baku, a legendary creature that is said to "eat dreams." It's a comicalization of the stylish, mysterious hit song created by the popular vocaloid producer Nem!
