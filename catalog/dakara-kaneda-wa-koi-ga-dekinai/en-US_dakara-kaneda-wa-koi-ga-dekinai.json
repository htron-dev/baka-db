    "sinopse": "Ako is a student at an art university, though she's far from the top of the class. One day, the head of the school is removed due to illness and an extremely logical-minded young man named Kaneda Masumi takes his place. Masumi looks like a businessman, and he starts by making logical economic steps for the school--by dramatically increasing tuition for the following year. Ako doesn't want to ask her grandmother to support her with even more money, and after getting the bottom grade on an assignment, she doesn't think she has a shot at a scholarship. When she breaks down in tears while talking over her options with Kaneda, he treats her with unexpected kindness, telling her to have more faith in herself. Now Ako is determined to work her way into a scholarship position, but she and her friends' ways of thinking still constantly clash with Kaneda's logical view of the world!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
