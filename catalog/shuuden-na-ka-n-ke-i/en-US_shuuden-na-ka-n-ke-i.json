    "sinopse": "Hibari is a young professional who works long hours and inevitably rides the last train home. It's not all bad–she also runs into the train station worker, Yokose. Yokose is kind and polite, looking out for Hibari as she often sleeps defenselessly (and with a bit of drool) on her way home. Their brief encounters are a bright spot in her hectic days.\n\n(Source: the manga habit)",
