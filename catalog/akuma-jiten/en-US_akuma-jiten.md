## Sinopse

Hiroyuki is a 16 year old boy, starting high school, and a life of living alone. He gets a great deal on a house to rent, even if it is a little run down, but there is one small problem. The current occupant of the house is a cute demoness named Milky Way... and Milky needs a servant. Hiroyuki's peaceful life is about to become entwined in the chaos of heaven, hell, and love triangles!
