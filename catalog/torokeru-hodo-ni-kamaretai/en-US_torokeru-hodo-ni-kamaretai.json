    "sinopse": "It's been six years since Takeshi (alpha) and Yoshihisa (omega) have been dating. Even though they have a sweet life together, it doesn't look like the serious Takeshi wants to become a pair with Yoshihisa. \"Maybe he doesn't bite me because we're not a 'destiny pair.'\" Yoshihisa is so worried about Takeshi's \"destiny pair\" that he forgets to take his heat suppressant pills and becomes consumed with a very strong heat. The heat is so uncontrollable, the two forget to use contraception and make meltingly passionate love... An omegaverse love story controlled by destiny!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
