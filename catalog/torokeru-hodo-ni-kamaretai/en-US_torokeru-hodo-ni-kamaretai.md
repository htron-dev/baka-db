## Sinopse

It's been six years since Takeshi (alpha) and Yoshihisa (omega) have been dating. Even though they have a sweet life together, it doesn't look like the serious Takeshi wants to become a pair with Yoshihisa. "Maybe he doesn't bite me because we're not a 'destiny pair.'" Yoshihisa is so worried about Takeshi's "destiny pair" that he forgets to take his heat suppressant pills and becomes consumed with a very strong heat. The heat is so uncontrollable, the two forget to use contraception and make meltingly passionate love... An omegaverse love story controlled by destiny!
