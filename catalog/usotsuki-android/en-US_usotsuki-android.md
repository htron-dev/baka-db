## Sinopse

For new high school students, great first impressions are a must. Being the earnest boy that he is, Jun Iriomote presents himself to his new classmates as someone who loves androids and robots. Next in line, Yuzu Tokashiki has to quickly think of a way to create an impression on Jun, the boy she has loved since middle school. With no hesitation at all, Yuzu decides to introduce herself as an android. Although her classmates doubt her words, they swiftly believe her upon seeing her remain completely emotionless.

However, this maiden in love is not as dull as she appears to be. She is simply a reserved and normal girl, and only her friend Miyako Aguni knows how truly expressive Yuzu is. Now, Yuzu must continue to fool everyone into believing she is a real android and, with the power of love and impressive new gadgets, win over her crush!
