## Sinopse

The jobless stray Taragi Setsu is a free spirited guy who visits the art supply store's owner, Kuratake Shinichirou, every now and then. Shinichirou doesn't actually know much about Setsu, who sleeps around with and lives off other men. He treats him frivolously, even though Setsu runs from men, inviting him to return and beg for Shinichirou to sleep with him. But his true feelings are..? Whenever he's caught, he escapes again. The haggling love of two thickheaded, and clumsy men.
