## Sinopse

Futsuu tte Nandarou? is an NHK documentary program about people with developmental disorders.

Part of the program are 2-minute short stories of real people (who narrate their own story) that when growing up, they did not understand what was wrong with them nor did their teachers. Each episode is animated by a different person and aims to showcase what is normal for them and how they grew up to be regular members of society. They were made to promote NHK's awareness campaign for the documentary series. The animated shorts were later streamed on NHK's official website and again later on NHK's official YouTube channel.
