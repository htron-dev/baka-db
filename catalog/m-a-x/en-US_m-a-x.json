    "sinopse": "Namu goes to a school where all the elites get idolized by the 'non-elites'. From models to computer geniuses, these students make tons of money on their own! Because the school gates are always crowded by screaming fans of these elites, it is difficult for Namu to get to class on time. One day, however, a new transfer student helps Namu out in her morning predicament. Guess who gets categorized as an elite almost immediately?\n\n(Source: Eclipse Scans)",
