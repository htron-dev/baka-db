## Sinopse

Cry fell for Sig the moment he saw him at school, and though they became good friends, the relationship never progressed to what Cry wanted. But when Cry's overprotective brother Hard becomes jealous of him branching-out and having friends, Sig begins to see things in a new light. The second half of the manga focuses on Hard. As Cry drifts away towards independence, what will Hard do, since his sole purpose in life was to protect his brother...?

Also contains a short extra to Inferior Doll. (Source: Storm in Heaven)
