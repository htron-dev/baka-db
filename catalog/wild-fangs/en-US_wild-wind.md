## Sinopse

Long ago in a distant land, when the heavens ruled the earth, the two of them met by a trick of destiny...

Called the "Wise man of the woods" and given much respect by the villagers, messenger of heaven Olgrius is searching for the origin of the incessant outbreak of storms. Then a villager, speaking riddles of an attacking beast, appears.

The being that Olgrius sees when he returns to the scene of the crime is a savage beast fallen from heaven. But the beast differs from the rumorsâ€”he touches Olgrius gently, and protects him from danger...!?
