    "sinopse": "At work, his lack of emotion earned him the name \"emotionless robot.\" Tougo Shiranami is spending another day feeling zero self worth. He's on his way back from work when he sees a pervert in the park fountain. A little curious, he talks to the man who turns out to be a foreign prince, Sanarfam. The prince finds Tougo's odd personality charming, and drags him back to his hotel. Once they start drinking, Tougo starts loosening up and showing a very human side to himself. The prince claims that he will be the one to prove Tougo's no machine...\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
