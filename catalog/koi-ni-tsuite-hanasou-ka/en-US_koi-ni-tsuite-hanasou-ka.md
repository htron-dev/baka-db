## Sinopse

Subaru is enrolled as a art major in the department of education at university. She's energetic and good-natured. There, she meets a rather ill-natured honor student who is enrolled in the same department as her. What's most surprising though, is that it turns out that this disagreeable boy is her next-door neighbor at her new apartment! Just what lies in store for Subaru's daily life now?
