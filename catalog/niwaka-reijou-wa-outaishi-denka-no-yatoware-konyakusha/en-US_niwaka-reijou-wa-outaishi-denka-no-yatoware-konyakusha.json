    "sinopse": "Although she had traveled to the Royal Capital to train as a lady of the court, before she realized it, the daughter of an impoverished Earl was seen as nothing more than another of the servants. It was during one of her usual morning cleaning rounds when by chance the Crown Prince Isaac, who was rumored for one reason or another to keep all women at arm's length, passed by, but... When she tried to return the document he dropped, she got caught up in a maelstrom of trouble!? And for that matter, what do you mean that happens to all the women who approach the Crown Prince...!?\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)",
