Mou Hitotsu no Shinwa - Eva is pregnant! What a shock... since she's the only human aboard this spaceship! 150 years ago, the sudden "shrinkage" of the Sun caused the destruction of the Earth, the Moon and Mars. Eva's parents and several technicians at Jupiter's base were the only survivors. The icy planet wasn't suitable for permanent dwelling, so they sent a fertilized egg into the space. Four robots were given the duty of raising the baby and finding a mate for her. They had spotted a man in a faraway planet and created an identical robot, Adam, to be Eva's husband. But they thought a human and a robot can't be a perfect match... no matter how much they love each other. Their plan is to leave Eva on the planet with the human Adam...

Napoleon Soro - During an annual robots' party Napoleon, an egg shaped robot, gloats about his owner and lover. "She's the most beautiful woman in the world and she loves me! She said I'm better than all the men." When she was 5 years old, she used to say "Round, round Napoleon is cuter than anyone else! Don't ever leave me! I want to marry you when I grow up!" Thus, Napoleon (nicknamed Mr. Egg Head by his fellow robots) is very happy about his appearance. But she's now a woman. She no longer remembers all those childhood promises nor would they mean anything to her. She wants to remake the old robot because she finds it embarrassing to have a servant who looks like an egg...

A Fairytale Judas - There's a special group of people who possess wings and are able to fly like birds. Because of their trait, they are caged and displayed like animals. They believe that a hero will rescue them someday.

A Million Pound Love - A 80 year-old lady ask a 20 year-old playboy to marry her as a last wish, in exchange for one million pounds.
