Willa Ross knew she wasn't welcome in her hometown of Cascade, Wyoming. Especially not by Clay Cantrell--who still held her responsible for the accident that caused the death of his sister five years before.
But when her aunt took ill, and desperately needed her to look after the failing family ranch, Willa couldn't say no! now Willa's vowed to keep out of Clay's way. Yet they were drawn to each other--this time not as love-struck teenagers, but as man and woman... .
