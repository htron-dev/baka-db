    "sinopse": "Kawamura Kazuya had dreamt of being a pilot when he was young. Thus when he heard that there's an aviation school five hours from where he stayed, Kawamura enrolled without giving much thought. He was placed in the same room with two other room mates. One of them, Itou, dropped out when he couldn't stand the tough life. This left Kawamura with Yoshitake, a tall, quiet and non-responsive guy.\n\nOne day as Kawamura and Yoshitake were hanging out in Morishita's room as usual, a phone call came for Kawamura--and he left to answer the call. When he was finished, Kawamura knocked on Morishita's door, wondering whether Yoshitake might still be there. However, there was no answer and Kawamura walked back to his room, wondering where Yoshitake might have been. And as it appear, Yoshitake and Morishita seems to be having sex in the dorm manager's room...\n\n(Source: MU)",
