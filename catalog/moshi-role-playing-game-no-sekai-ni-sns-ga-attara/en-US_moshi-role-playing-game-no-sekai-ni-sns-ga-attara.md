## Sinopse

When a fantasy world has fully functioning internet and smartphones (for some reason), it's only natural for its sixteen year-old Hero to declare war on the Demon Lord via text message. But is it natural for that Demon Lord to be an innocent snowflake who hates conflict...!? Take a peek into this unfortunate Hero's chatlog with a...unique group of RPG characters, like an overly pure Demon Lord, her cheerful Generals (who all adore her), and the kidnapped princess who seems to be developing a major crush on her captor!
