## Sinopse

Every day, childhood friends Kyou and Akazome try their hardest to create an irresistible manga that'll have no problems getting serialized in a magazine…but the going is slow and not promising. One day, Kyou's classmate Miu confesses her love for him with disastrous results. But perhaps this drama is just what the manga needs?
