    "sinopse": "Akito wants the stereotypical \"isekai\" experience and so he summons himself to another world, however things don't quite go as planned. He's the same unskilled loser that he was before and he can barely scrape together enough money to eat. One day a cute girl approaches him with a contract to join her party. He can't read what it says, but ends up being forced to sign it anyway. What's the worst that could happen?\n\n(Source: MangaDex)",
