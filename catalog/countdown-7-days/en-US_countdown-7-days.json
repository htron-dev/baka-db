    "sinopse": "Mitamura is a teacher at the school in Sheol, a parallel world in which the souls of those who have passed away gather. While escorting one of his students, Tsuru Shimizu, on an excursion to Earth, he loses sight of her. In the course of tracking her down, Mitamura runs over 20-year-old Hanasuke Onigawara with his scooter. Fortunately, Hanasuke recovers from the accident fairly quickly, but that is because he had already died as the result of a head-on collision with a truck the day before.\n\nHanasuke is slow to accept the reality of his death. Sensing an opportunity, Mitamura makes a deal with him: join the search for Shimizu in exchange for the secret of how to be revived. However, the clock is ticking on both their goals. After seven days, Hanasuke will be sent straight to Sheol, and Mitamura will have to return without Shimizu and consequently lose his job. As the two try all manner of ways to lure Shimizu from hiding, the countdown continues relentlessly.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Susukaburi",
