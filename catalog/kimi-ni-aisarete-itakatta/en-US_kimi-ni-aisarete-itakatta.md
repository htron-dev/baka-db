## Sinopse

The ways of social niceties and fitting in are far too complex for the timid and awkward Kanae Kanai to ever understand. Even so, sweat pooling under her skin and tension coursing through her body, she goes along with her "friends," all in an attempt to avoid being ostracized.

But going with the flow is something Kanae does only during the day. By night, she participates in compensated dating, relishing the feeling of being needed by someone. However, even for a girl like her, who is plagued every day by fear and anxiety, there is hope. Despite his overwhelming popularity, Hiroshi Nomura, the ace of the baseball team, remains kind to everyone regardless of clique.

While many would shun someone like Kanae upon discovering their situation, Hiroshi does the opposite—he offers his hand to pull her up and his shoulder to cry on. The pits of despair are unfathomably deep, and Kanae might need that helping hand to escape from them.
