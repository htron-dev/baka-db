    "sinopse": "Critics of the book say it distorts history by claiming that Taiwanese women volunteered to be comfort women for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Such claims were backed by comments from petrochemical Chi Mei Corporation Chairman Hsu Wen-lung whom the author cited as confirming that no women were forced into prostitution.\n\nTaiwan legislators and other protesters stormed Taipei's biggest bookstore, grabbing the books and setting it on fire on the sidewalk. On 2 March 2001 the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of China barred Kobayashi from travel to Taiwan, igniting objections from high ranking government officials including National Policy Advisor Alice King. President Chen Shui-bian spoke out in defense of King and Kobayashi stating that freedom of speech is the right of everyone and must be safeguarded. The ban was lifted on 23 March 2001.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
