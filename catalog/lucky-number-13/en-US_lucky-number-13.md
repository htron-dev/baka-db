## Sinopse

Romance began for these these two when Satou Hiroshi fell into Tsumabuki's arms. Literally. From the fifth floor. However, when accidents and mishaps seem to start following Tsumabuki, can their love last, especially since it's rumored that noone who have dated Hiroshi have lasted for more than week?
