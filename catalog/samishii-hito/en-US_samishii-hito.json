    "sinopse": "Kinoshita Rinko, 20 years old, has been fired after taking the blame of a colleague's mistake during her probation period.\n\nThe reason behind her action is, \"it is very lonely when you're crying and there is no one to help you.\"\n\nOn her way back home, she met a beautiful woman crying and could not leave her by herself. Believing in Rinko's reasoning, the woman asked Rinko to take her place to protect her brother, Shinomiya Ryou.\n\n(Source: MU)",
