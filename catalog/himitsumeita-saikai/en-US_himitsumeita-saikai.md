## Sinopse

Part-time hotel receptionist Phoebe and Greek multimillionaire Jed were crazy about each other. He embraced Phoebe and wrapped her in love and happiness. One day Phoebe discovers she's pregnant and joyfully reveals the news to Jed. But his reply is unexpectedly cruel—he says there's no man in the world who would want a pregnant mistress! In shock, Phoebe has a miscarriage and vanishes from Jed's life. But five years later, he suddenly reappears!
