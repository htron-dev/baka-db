## Sinopse

Various short 4-koma scenes about five girls, Shinobu, Alice, Karen, Youko, and Aya, all attending the same school together. The main idea behind all of the scenes are that the two English girls, Alice and Karen (Alice is pure English, while Karen is half-English, half-Japanese), are trying to live in Japan and are trying to learn their culture and language!
