## Sinopse

Due to an economic downturn plaguing Japan, Shiina Nagasawa decides to take up prostitution as a means to support her family after her father goes bankrupt. To this end, she attends a party where the high-profile government members in attendance are all eager to satisfy their carnal desires.

As Shiina degrades herself, an intruder wearing an exotic mask crashes the party, and she recognizes him as her classmate Shou Hazama. Claiming to be "Akumetsu," he interrogates Japan's former finance minister about all the evil deeds the other has committed. He then proceeds to brutally murder the man and drag his body to the lobby. When Akumetsu is shot, he somehow blows his own head off afterward.

Still in disbelief, Shiina manages to go to school the next day. But in a shocking turn of events, Shou Hazama is there to greet her in the classroom. How is he alive, and what does he intend to do next?
