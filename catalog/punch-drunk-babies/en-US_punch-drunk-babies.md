## Sinopse

Kyouhei is a boxer, training to become world champ. He has a dark past. Yuuya is a chef, or was until Kyouhei got him so riled up he slugged him on the job and was fired. Minami _shivers happily_ is this super-gorgeous boy who once trained with Kyouhei's, though they also have bad blood in the past, and are now rivals.
