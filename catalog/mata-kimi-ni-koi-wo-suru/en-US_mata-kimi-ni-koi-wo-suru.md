## Sinopse

High-schooler Kai Hosho can't control himself one day, and on impulse, rubs off against his favorite teammate, Azusa Saotome. Things get uncomfortable, and they fall out of touch. Eight years later... Kai, a successful host, moves into an apartment building and discovers the landlord is Azusa!! Feeling guilty all these years, when Kai sees that Azusa is the same caring person, he finally understands his emotions from that day eight years ago!!
