## Sinopse

Haruka Iijima and his shy, sweet teacher Tokio Nakagami have been an item for a few months, and they'd really like to take their physical relationship even further. Too bad the rest of the pesky Nakagami clan always manages to meddle! The two lovebirds always hold their heads up high, but what will they do when the Nakagamis receive a surprise visit from a strange, fiendish devil?
