## Sinopse

Yeo Jin Heung is a late-bloomer who could only dream of finding herself in a shoujo-manhwa-style love story. When she meets a stormy, romantic hottie, Eun Bak Ha, it seems like Jin Heung's dreams could be coming true...though there are many difficult challenges ahead. (Source: Pink Rose Scans)
