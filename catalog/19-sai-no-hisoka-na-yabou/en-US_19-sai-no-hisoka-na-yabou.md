## Sinopse

1-3. Water Breath
An injury destroyed Olympic hopeful Ryuji Hayashida's promising swimming career. He was transferred to a university where he believed no one knew who he was, but he was wrong. There was someone who recognized him the moment their gazes met at the university's swimming club.

4. Pension
   A tempestuous tale of a rock band and the consequences of their enigmatic guitarist's return. It didn't take long to realize he has a keen interest in their lead singer.

5. Dance
   Shachi never got over his feelings for his classmate Michio who jokingly danced with him at school. Years after their school graduation he discovered what Michio did for a living. The discovery inspired him to sell his father's car for one night with Michio, which turned into a different kind of dance. [warning: contains S&M scenes]

6. Longing
   Shy and timid high school student Sakaki has always watched his classmate Ryoji from afar, but he wasn't as invisible as he believed himself to be.
