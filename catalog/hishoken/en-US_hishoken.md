## Sinopse

Secretary Saito Yo was transferred to a new director named Nabeshima Hisatsugu after a recent reorganization. However, the supposedly “never worked a day in a company” Nabeshima had his new secretary totally wrapped around his finger! Not only that, Yo was further devastated when Nabeshima commented that Yo wasn’t what he thought a secretary should be.
