    "sinopse": "Secretary Saito Yo was transferred to a new director named Nabeshima Hisatsugu after a recent reorganization. However, the supposedly “never worked a day in a company” Nabeshima had his new secretary totally wrapped around his finger! Not only that, Yo was further devastated when Nabeshima commented that Yo wasn’t what he thought a secretary should be. Shocked and frustrated, Yo carelessly blurted out while he was drunk one night that Nabeshima should “take advantage” of his services. Then the next day, Nabeshima totally changed his attitude—!?\n\n(Source: MU)",
