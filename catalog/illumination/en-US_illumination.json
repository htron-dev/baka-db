At his wit's end, he spends one night with Sudo, a man he met at a bar. It was supposed to be a one-night stand, an event he'd forget about the next day with someone he'd never see again. But when Sudo does show up again, this time determined to stay for good, Mikita's life starts to fall apart...\n\n(Source: Storm in Heaven)",
