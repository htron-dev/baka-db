## Sinopse

A romantic comedy about Yuri Keito, a boy who has clairvoyance but isn't good at it, and Mitsuhashi Misumi, a girl who likes strange things. One day, looking at Misumi's back, Yuri looks through her jacket and sees the message "Anyone who can read this message, please come to the astronomy club room after school." When he goes to the club room and explains his ability, Misumi asks, "Why don't you let me study you?"
