## Sinopse

After an off day, Shougo can’t believe his bad luck when he comes across a moral dilemma: leave the strange man sleeping in the street to rest there, or tell him that it’s dangerous and let him rest at his studio apartment. Shougo, unable to leave the man be, makes sure he is okay and ends up letting him stay at his home indefinitely.

Levi, the man Shougo found, is on a working holiday in Japan but was tricked by his friend, leaving him with no place to sleep or work. He shows gratitude by doing whatever he thinks Shougo wants him to do, including taking care of private matters that Shougo tried to keep a secret. Conflicted, Shougo avoids Levi to try to work out his emotions on his own. But once he does realize, will Shougo make it before Levi’s time in Japan is up?
