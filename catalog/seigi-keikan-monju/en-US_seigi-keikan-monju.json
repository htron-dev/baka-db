Aside of being forced to team up with Junpei Yamagashi, a young police officer obsessed with women and whether or not he's balding, he also needs to defend himself against hostility towards him. When a perverted voyeur gets reported the robot places his suspicions immediately on his partner. But Junpei won't stand for the accusations and is determined to restore his honor!\n\n(Source: MU)",
