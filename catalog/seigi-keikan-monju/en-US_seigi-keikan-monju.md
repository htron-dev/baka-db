## Sinopse

Monju, the last representative of the Japanese police force, can not believe his circuits! He has been assigned to a police station in a rural area. Aside of being forced to team up with Junpei Yamagashi, a young police officer obsessed with women and whether or not he's balding, he also needs to defend himself against hostility towards him. When a perverted voyeur gets reported the robot places his suspicions immediately on his partner. But Junpei won't stand for the accusations and is determined to restore his honor!
