## Sinopse

Chinmoku Girl no Little Cry
Kohane Kuchinashi has always fumbled her words, thus resolving to speak as little as possible so that others would not laugh at her. When she first meets her upperclassman, Touma Igarashi, as usual she is unable to say what she means. Deciding that actions speak louder than words, she subsequently leaves a lasting impression on him. Although Kohane and Igarashi are able to sufficiently understand each other, never before has she wanted so badly to successfully articulate her feelings.

Senken Shounen Syndrome
Ever since falling down a flight of stairs at school, Kyou Uchiyama has been excessively paranoid about potential dangers around him that might cause him to die. He meets a fellow first-year, Iku Hijiri, who initially seems to be his opposite. She appears reckless and determined to enjoy herself without fear of death—but the truth is that she has more reasons than Kyou to be wary. However, her anxieties are outweighed by her desperate desire to experience life to the fullest.

Yankee Shoujo to Hinekure Danshi
Reiji Kinashi hates troublesome things such as forming relationships with others. But when the transfer student—and apparent delinquent—Ichika Anehara demands that he be her friend, he neither declines nor flees as both actions would require too much effort. For someone who considers the act of exchanging email addresses to be annoying, Kinashi is baffled to find himself exchanging handwritten letters with Anehara. Through their unbalanced correspondence, he begins to glimpse the sincere nature hidden behind her scary exterior.

Miren Boy, Miren Girl
Since she was young, Tsubaki Kiriyama has been able to see "Miren": lingering souls with remaining attachments to the world. Although her childhood friend Kaede could not see them, he shared her burden of the bullying that resulted from being caught talking to invisible presences. When Kaede suddenly dies and becomes a Miren himself, Tsubaki begins to speculate what is preventing him from moving on. She never considers that freeing him from his bindings could create regrets of her own.

Tsuiraku JK to Haijin Kyoushi Bangaihen
Female high school student Mikoto Ochiai receives special instruction from physics teacher Jin Haiba on the subject of cannibalism.
