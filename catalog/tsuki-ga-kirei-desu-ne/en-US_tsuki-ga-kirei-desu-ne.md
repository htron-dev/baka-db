## Sinopse

This is a story set in a faraway country, whose inhabitants are distinguished by the animal ears on their heads, and their acceptance of same-sex marriage. Chiru Kasuga, the 16-year-old only daughter of the head of a major company, is about to leave home to marry Senri Shinonome, a woman whom she's only met once, on a moonlit night seven years earlier.
