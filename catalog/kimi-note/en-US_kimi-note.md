## Sinopse

For some reason, Miyasaka finds himself absolutely enamored by the scent of his attractive male classmate Sawatari. But when he tries the cologne Sawatari recommends, the effect just isn't the same–it has to be on Sawatari or the cologne won't have the same effect.

A sweet story about the high school love between two boys.
