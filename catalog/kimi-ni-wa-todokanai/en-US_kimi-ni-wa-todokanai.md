## Sinopse

Childhood friends Kakeru Ashiya and Yamato Oohara seem like they would never get along with each other. Kakeru is an amiable student who flunks all of his pop quizzes, and the handsome Yamato is capable of anything other than making friends. Kakeru pays a lot of attention to almost everything his friend does, but he is particularly interested in knowing why Yamato never acknowledges any of the numerous romantic confessions he often gets from girls. Thus, when they are alone in a classroom, Kakeru grabs the opportunity to ask Yamato his meddlesome questions.

Yamato gives him the vaguest of answers and, by impulse, almost lets out a declaration of love toward Kakeru. Although subtle, Kakeru knows deep down that it is a confession—but he stays in denial. Due to this unprecedented incident, Yamato, who has been secretly admiring Kakeru for quite some time, may never reach his heart.
