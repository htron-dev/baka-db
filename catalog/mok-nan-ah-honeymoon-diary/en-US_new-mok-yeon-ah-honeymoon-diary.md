## Sinopse

Mok Yuna's mother is the owner of the family Dojang (martial arts place) and she's strong as ever! Even the strong Yuna's beaten up easily by her merciless mother. After having her older sister Nan-Ah suffer due to an engaged marriage planned by her mother (read the prequel), she's now to marry a Japanese gangster? Ryu Sein, her best friend, will save him oh yes he will- but will he be successful is the true question.
