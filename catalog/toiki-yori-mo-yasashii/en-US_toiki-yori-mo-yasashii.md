## Sinopse

Two years ago Masato fell in love with the gentle-handed Kazaoka (they spent a night together without telling each other their names). He searched for that man and found out that he's a writer and that he goes to a nearby café. Masato starts working there part-time, and Kazaoka starts coming to the café more regularly, but he does not seem to recognize Masato.
