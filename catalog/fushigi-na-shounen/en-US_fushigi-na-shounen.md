## Sinopse

Saburou Oonishi, an ordinary boy known as Sabutan, is a member of the Anpaka Gang made up of naughty boys in the neighborhood. Sabutan is nearly forced to become the leader of the Anpaka Gang, but refuses. As punishment, he is made to walk through a dark underpass, still under construction, alone. The underpass is a place where mysterious phenomena are said to happen from time to time. Sabutan is absorbed into the wall where some tiles have come off, and strays into a four-dimensional world. There he finds a mysterious spacious room and a four-dimensional creature that looks something like a doll. Having been given the power to stop time by the four-dimensional creature, Sabutan comes back to this world. Now, by simply shouting "Time, be still!" everything freezes except Sabutan himself. In this way he can escape from bullets or train accidents. Because of this power, Sabutan begins to become entwined in mysterious events.
