## Sinopse

In the late Taisho era, when Japanese and Western styles were mixed, a young man named Uruya, who has been living in such a turmoil-filled world, meets a lady in a Wafuku named Karin one day. Unlike himself, Karin is a bright and cheerful person, and for some reason, she is interested in Uruya and keeps teasing him. At first, Uruya is unpleasant, but he slowly becomes addicted to the pleasure and mysterious charm that Karin brings... Romeo and Juliet of the Taisho Meiji era!? Let the immoral romance where corruption and teasing are intertwined begin!
