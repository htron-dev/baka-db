Every time you sent me one of your fake smile, my fists clench automatically
If I had a gun in my pocket, I would have shot you.

Tied by a secret that keeps him from loving the one he loves, Choi EunJo.
The handsome and much beloved idol Im Sol - no girl can resist his killer smile.

But for Narae, all she feels is disgust.
Bam!!
Where will Narae's Love Bullet fly?
