    "sinopse": "Set in the distant future, the world has undertaken a reform where the police organisation, as a whole, dissolved, and the local police and Metropolitan Police Department officially semi-privatised. Policemen are now called as \"Sheriff\" and hired by people as security against criminals. Money is given to those who catch the criminals, and this starts the boom of bounty hunters or simply called \"Hunters\". In comes the lazy sheriff Isuka Shinnosuke, who is hired by Yazama town's mayor.\n\n[Written by orithyea]",
