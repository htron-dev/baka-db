    "sinopse": "Izumi is a high school student whose life is filled with misfortune. Ever since he was young, he would always return home with injuries. Due to his unlucky disposition, his days are full of nothing but unfortunate events—that is, until he started dating Shikimori.\n\nOne can describe Shikimori as the perfect girlfriend: cute, adorable, and unbelievably in love with Izumi. However, she is occasionally not so charming; instead, she becomes the coolest girlfriend in the scariest way possible! Her demanding presence and earnest concern for Izumi's wellbeing never ceases to take his breath away. With the cute yet cool Shikimori now by Izumi's side, his luckless days are over, bringing a life full of happiness and warmth.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
