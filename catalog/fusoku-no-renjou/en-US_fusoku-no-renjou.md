## Sinopse

Miyata, a gay editor, got dumped by his lover due to his lingering affection for a past love. When drowning his sorrows at Nichoume, Miyata unexpectedly came across Ikura, a work partner and the representative of a brand name leather company. Ikura, who's bi, invited Miyata to a drink but got a curt rejection. The next day, Miyata was worried about awkwardness at work, but on the contrary, Ikura seemed to like him and requested to go out with Miyata in private..?
