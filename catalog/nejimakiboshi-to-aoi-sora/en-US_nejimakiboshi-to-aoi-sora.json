    "sinopse": "This is the tale of a boy whose mother was killed in a meteor strike on their island home 6 months ago, something everyone knows was the crashing of an alien ship but no one will confirm. One day, a girl quite literally drops out of the sky on him. She at first takes him hostage from people hunting her but it eventually comes out that she's from outer space and if there's one thing that this boy's mother taught him, it is to NOT leave a damsel in distress…\n\n(Source: Natsuyume)",
