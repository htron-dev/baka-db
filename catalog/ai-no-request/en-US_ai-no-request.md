## Sinopse

Based on Anne Weale's novel "A Touch of the Devil"

Seize today... don't trust in tomorrow! Blanca had never felt such a strong attraction t a man before. Yet Joe Crawford, the darkly handsome piano player at the local restaurant, was clearly not good husband material. Living on his boat in the small Spanish harbor, Joe would no doubt drift out of her life as he'd drifted into it. "I want you very much; come live with me," was his only offer. Could Blanca be faulted for refusing? On the other hand, if she truly loved him--and she did--why not?
