## Sinopse

You've never seen manga like this before! No annoying speed lines or sappy, neotenic eyeballs here â€” just pure Japanese counterculture. This anthology of contemporary underground comics from Japan features a wide variety of styles and topics ranging from the humorous to the profound. There's a whole world of comics out there, and it's not all Godzilla and schoolgirls! A great introduction to the other Japanese comics featuring Asia's answers to Robert Crumb, Dan Clowes, and Chester Brown!
