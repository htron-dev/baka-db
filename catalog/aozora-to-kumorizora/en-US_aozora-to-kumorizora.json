    "sinopse": "One day, Azure becomes acutely aware that her body is being controlled by someone else and, even moreso, she is aware that this person intends to kill her and make it look like a suicide. But Azure doesn't actually care if she dies; she has wanted to die for quite some time. Her controller, not satisfied with taking the life of someone who actually wishes for death, vows to make her into the type of target he prefers: someone who enjoys life, so that when he kills her, she will die full of regrets.\n\nThrough a few twists and turns, Azure meets her controller—a man named Claude—and the two begin to spend time together in order to further Claude's ultimate goal. But these two have more in common than they know, and soon, a strange relationship blooms between them.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
