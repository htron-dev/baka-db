## Sinopse

As the son of a doctor and a lawyer, Kazushi has been groomed from the age of five to be intelligent and successful. He has no chance to play with friends due to his tutoring sessions and additional lessons, and his only respite from studying is the time spent together with his younger brother, Keishi. It seems that Keishi looks up to him precisely because he is accomplished, so after Kazushi fails an important test, he is unable to face the disappointment in his brother's eyes.

From that point forward, Kazushi stops holding himself to high standards. Keishi becomes the pride of their family instead, gaining entrance to the prestigious Kirikou, an all-boys school for brilliant students. With the desire to avoid going home after his own classes end, Kazushi searches for ways to pass time, such as visiting the arcade with a male friend. When this friend kisses Kazushi on the mouth—in full view of Keishi, who is standing on the street outside—Kazushi expects to face a few insults before the incident is forgotten. However, the next day, when it seems like Kazushi is asleep, Keishi sneaks into his brother's room and kisses Kazushi as well!
