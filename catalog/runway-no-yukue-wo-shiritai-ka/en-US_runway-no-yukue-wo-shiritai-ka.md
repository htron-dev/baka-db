## Sinopse

He's got urges, so much so that he wants to bang every second of every day. Hikoichi Namino is a college student slash magazine model. Akira Tada is a stylist slash magazine model. The two have known each other for four years and have been dating for six months. With the dignified and beautiful Akira by his side, Hikoichi's modeling career is going well. Their peers are cheering them on, too. Although Hikoichi's beside himself with joy every day, there's just one thing missing... he and his beloved Akira have yet to go all the way! Akira's as pure and innocent as they come, which only stirs up Hikoichi even more...! This raunchy and dramatic story features a hottie with a big heart, his coolheaded-yet-aloof beauty, the glamorous world they live in, and a future where their hearts and bodies will connect and live together!
