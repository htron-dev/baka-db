## Sinopse

Kamihara Minoru is a stubborn and awkward yet naive high school student who's currently in a secret relationship with Matsunaga Yuuto, someone who's practically an idol at his school. However, Yuuto's the kind of guy who plays around and switches lovers on a frequent basis, so much so that he's even been nicknamed the "butterfly of love". With a nickname like that, is it any wonder he turned gay?

A love story about guys who would like to stop feeling the way they do for each other but can't.
