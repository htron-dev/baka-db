## Sinopse

I've admired my sempai ever since I can remember, but when I finally worked up the courage to confess my love to her, she said...

"You want to go out with me? But we're both girls!"
"Isn't that... a little strange?"

I wanted to die, but then I met an awesome couple, Hiiro and Miyako, who helped me and gave me encouragement.

Okay, I'll give it another shot!

Starting with "Koi Hana Double," a bittersweet depiction of the love between two classmates at a girls-only high school and an adult couple, Renai Joshi File is a story collection filled with the love between young women. Two new stories about the couples of "Koi Hana Double" are included in this volume!
