    "sinopse": "I've admired my sempai ever since I can remember, but when I finally worked up the courage to confess my love to her, she said...\n\n\"You want to go out with me? But we're both girls!\"\n\"Isn't that... a little strange?\"\n\nI wanted to die, but then I met an awesome couple, Hiiro and Miyako, who helped me and gave me encouragement.\n\nOkay, I'll give it another shot!\n\nStarting with \"Koi Hana Double,\" a bittersweet depiction of the love between two classmates at a girls-only high school and an adult couple, Renai Joshi File is a story collection filled with the love between young women. Two new stories about the couples of \"Koi Hana Double\" are included in this volume!\n\n(Source: Back cover blurb)",
