## Sinopse

Summary by Midnight Scans :

Beautiful teachers and secretive extra-curriculum lessons!
White suits, sports, spectacles, and extremely attractive teachers!
If it were you, which teacher would you choose to go to for a “not allowed” lesson?!
Ikemen Teacher and Ikenai, a personal lesson after school?!
Extremely charming English teacher, Sanada Kyoichi, is as charming as a prince.
However, the truth is that he is a sadist that has made Yume turn into a person with a slavery-characteristic!
He appeared in front of Yume, when she was a high school student, and he ordered her around with “order” and “praises” at a grade higher than his pervious commands, but…?!
Another white suit devil?!

A sadistic chemistry teacher and a killer-smile, spectacled history teacher. A total of three new sensational teacher love stories drawn by Nana-chan.
