## Sinopse

The country of Greenland, after losing the war to the Imperial Army, were in agony and despair for what will the future bring them. They had hired mercenaries to help them during the war and now they've come back to collect their reward while the country were still picking up their pieces of their broken dreams. By that time, the King has passed away and his heir was still too young to take up on the throne. After hearing the news of the King's death the mercenaries decided to take over the throne and rule in his place. But there was an obstacle in their way... The Oracle!
