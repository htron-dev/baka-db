## Sinopse

Shindou works at a company where a certain product is being created. A product that is a cyborg sexroid based on an actual boy's body. Shindou is then grudgingly put in charge of their prototype. He is initially very against his new assignment, but this cyborg boy eventually manages to melt his heart.
