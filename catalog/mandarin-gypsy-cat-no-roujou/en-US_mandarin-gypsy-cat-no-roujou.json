    "sinopse": "Somewhere, in Asia, in the future... For several years now, men have hardly been born. The latter are often reduced to their role of reproductive partner. Society is built around a matriarchal system. Neither wars nor conflicts disturb the daily life and the balance. But some have decided to flee the city. They settled outside, in a slum. This is where Sanada resides. Sanada has a secret... a secret that could well stir up the lust of her fellows.",
