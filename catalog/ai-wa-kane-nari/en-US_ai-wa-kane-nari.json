    "sinopse": "After running away from home, Sora, a demon who knows nothing of the world, found himself in the red light district. Eriru, the owner of a brothel, sees him loitering around after he got pickpocketed, and picks him up, mistakenly thinking he wanted to work there.\n\n\"So? Are you a top or a bottom?\" What waited for Sora, who didn't even know what that meant, was days of debt and pleasure in prostitution paradise.\n\n(Source: Kasakura Shuppansha, translated)",
