## Sinopse

Amano, who returned to the city where he lived as a child for the first time in 10 years, shares the joy of reuniting with his childhood friend Yukio Sawatari on the first day of the transfer, but suddenly Yukio suddenly becomes a woman and she can't hide her confusion. Yukio had an odd illness out of 100,000 people called "Idiopathic isoform metamorphosis!"

The childhood friend♂ that became a feminine body is cute and crazy!? Forbidden TSF (sex change) love comedy!
