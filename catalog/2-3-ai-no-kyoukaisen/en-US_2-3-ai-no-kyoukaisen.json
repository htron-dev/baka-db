    "sinopse": "2/3 Ai no Kyoukaisen revolves around a young man who is a hikikomori, NEET, and 2D-girls otaku. Instead of going to school, he spends his time playing bishōjo games. His childhood friend Hime Takanayagi, and his family, attempt to try to bring the young man back to normal society. The protagonist is torn between his love of the girls in his games, or the girls in reality, which results in a struggle within himself to decide which girls he loves the most: those from the digital world, or from the real world.\n(from Manga-Updates)",
