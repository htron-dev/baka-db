His girlfriend, Minori Sawamura, has also landed her dream job but at a rival company, the BNB Corporation.\n\nBoth Ryou and Minori are educated on \"corporate spies\" by their respective employers: agents who seduce employees from rival companies and coax them into revealing their company's secrets and other valuable information. Takebou Commercial once fell victim to a corporate spy sent by the BNB Corporation, causing the company to go bankrupt. As a result, relationships between employees of the two companies are strictly forbidden.\n\nRyou and Minori are distraught, but they decide to keep their relationship a secret from their colleagues to continue working their dream jobs. However, unexpected circumstances arise, and the young couple must face various challenges to save their relationship.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
