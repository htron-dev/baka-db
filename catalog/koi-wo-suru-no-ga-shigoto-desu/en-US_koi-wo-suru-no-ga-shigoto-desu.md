## Sinopse

Ryou Hatsuhi is a young man who has just secured his dream job at Takebou Commercial. His girlfriend, Minori Sawamura, has also landed her dream job but at a rival company, the BNB Corporation.

Both Ryou and Minori are educated on "corporate spies" by their respective employers: agents who seduce employees from rival companies and coax them into revealing their company's secrets and other valuable information. Takebou Commercial once fell victim to a corporate spy sent by the BNB Corporation, causing the company to go bankrupt. As a result, relationships between employees of the two companies are strictly forbidden.

Ryou and Minori are distraught, but they decide to keep their relationship a secret from their colleagues to continue working their dream jobs. However, unexpected circumstances arise, and the young couple must face various challenges to save their relationship.
