Her husband is gorgeous and her baby is sleeping next to her... Her husband says they've been happily married for five years, but she isn't so sure. Although he constantly talks about the future, Alaina is fixated on their mysterious past. She cannot deny the attraction she feels toward him... until she remembers the reason they were on the verge of divorce!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
