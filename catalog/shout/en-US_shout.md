## Sinopse

Beginning of college; checking out the school clubs... Nagi likes the drama club because it has a cool-looking guy whom Nagi thinks is kind. But once she joins the club he makes the club members do embarrassing things in public--and makes Nagi cry. His name is Rin, known as "Sad Yama." He won't let Nagi quit the club--and he won't let go of her either!
