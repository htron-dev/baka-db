Unable to just leave her there to die, Dale takes her home and becomes her adoptive father.\n\nDevil or not, Latina is beyond adorable, and the adventurer soon finds himself head over heels with being a parent.\n\nBut why was she out in the forest in the first place—and why does she carry the mark of a criminal?\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club, edited)",
