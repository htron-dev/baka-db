    "sinopse": "What do you get when you put a down-to-earth college student in a supposedly vacant apartment that's actually full of some quirky, otherworldly creatures? A whole lot of trouble, a whole lot of cuteness, and a whole lot of fun. Sometimes cheap rent is enough to make you put up with the strangest of neighbors and roommates, but forget about sugar, spice, and everything nice; and get ready for potato chips, pranks, and everything messy!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",
