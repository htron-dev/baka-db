## Sinopse

A collection of three short stories loosely based on fairy tales.

In Swan Lake, a girl feels just like the swan princess, elegant but paddling furiously beneath the surface... and waiting for a rich prince to sweep her away.

In Mermaid, the famous Little Mermaid has been reincarnated as a high school girl, who has one more chance to find her prince.

Finally, in Frog Princess, a girl meets an annoying boy who has been cursed to turn into a frog every time he hears the word "frog".
