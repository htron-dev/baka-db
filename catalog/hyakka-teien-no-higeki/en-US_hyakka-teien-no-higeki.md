## Sinopse

On the outskirts of Neo-Hong Kong lies a mysterious Chinese-style garden. Legend has it that anyone who looks upon the fairy of the garden will die before the night is out.

Five years ago, Douglas Pyke was charged with discovering the true nature of this fairy, but when he accidentally killed a woman in the line of duty, he left the police force forever. Now, a cabbie and sometime private eye, he is asked to find a missing scientist and confront the mysteries of the garden once more.
