    "sinopse": "These stories, roughly paralleling the original Wedding Peach storyline, feature younger characters aimed at a younger audience. Wedding Peach: Young Love is a collection of these often-overlooked episodes. Fans of the original series will be tickled to see their favorite characters, both hero and villain, recast in this warm and fuzzy alternate adventure. Yazawa even throws in a few new characters for readers to fall in love with. There's the demon trio of Blitz, Cloud and Noise and a few more Jama folk, too. Together, they join Wedding Peach and her heavenly crew for one final tussle between good and evil. (Source: Viz)",
