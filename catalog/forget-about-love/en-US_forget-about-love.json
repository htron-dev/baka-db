Dating without money is like being in a desert without an oasis or having a mochi without the red bean filling. He must also be smart-class and etiquette are absolute must-haves. These are traits that will get handed down to your children, so be sure to read through his past report cards if you want this to be a successful long-term relationship!\n\nSe-Lim Lee knew exactly what she wanted out of life and how to get it...until a month ago.
