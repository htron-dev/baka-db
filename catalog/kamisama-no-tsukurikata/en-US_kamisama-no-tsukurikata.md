## Sinopse

Koharu is in training to become a warrior goddess, but lately she's been restless. Being raised in a Goddess Palace means she's never seen men before, and like most 15-year-old girls, she has a keen interest in them. After finally escaping to the outside world, her superiors agree to let her stay there under supervision. But a showdown with Yusemi, the evil force that Koharu is destined to face, looms.
