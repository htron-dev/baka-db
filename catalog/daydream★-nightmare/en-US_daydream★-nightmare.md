## Sinopse

Meet Kusumi. He views Ichi as his god. He has no interest in real life girls because anime is his life. Meet Ichi. He has a secret that no one knows about, and he fights to hide it from others. He also has a past that seems to be surfacing through his dreams. But what does it mean when a guy promises to protect him by eating the "bad things"? Join Ichi in his adventure to find out about himself, and what his secret really holds.
