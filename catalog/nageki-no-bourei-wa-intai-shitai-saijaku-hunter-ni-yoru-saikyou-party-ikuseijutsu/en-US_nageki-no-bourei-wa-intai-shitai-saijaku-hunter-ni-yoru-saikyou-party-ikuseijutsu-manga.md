## Sinopse

It's the golden age of treasure hunters who seek wealth, honor, power and glory, and explore treasures around the world without regard to danger. "Let's become treasure hunters," said Kurai Andolihy, who swore an oath with his childhood friends to become the strongest... but he discovered during his first quest that he has no talent. But that was only the beginning of his adventure.

"I can't do this anymore. I want to quit."
"Oh, I see. In other words, we should fight harder and cover for you, that's a good handicap."
"Rest assured, Kurai. We'll protect you!"
"Oh, wait. If you step on that, the trap will destroy you without leaving a speck of dust behind. Be careful, Leader!"

Protected by his overpowered childhood friends, sought out by newbies and nobles, they aim to be heroes and find powerful treasures. Will Kruai really be able to retire safely from being a treasure hunter?
