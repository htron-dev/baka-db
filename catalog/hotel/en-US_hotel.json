    "sinopse": "A hotel is a living thing. Love and joy, sadness and hate, and even betrayal; all contained within these walls. It is also a metropolis. Beauty parlor and jewelry store, restaurant and pharmacy, hospital and shoeshine. Everything you need to live is here. The Room Key is all-powerful. You can use it to buy food, jewelry, and to clean your clothes, all without a single reach of the wallet.\n\nAs a new morning comes, the being continues beating. Supplying blood into every extremity from its center. And as problems arrive, they are dealt with, leaving no abnormalities.\n\nThis is the Hotel Platon.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
