## Sinopse

A hotel is a living thing. Love and joy, sadness and hate, and even betrayal; all contained within these walls. It is also a metropolis. Beauty parlor and jewelry store, restaurant and pharmacy, hospital and shoeshine. Everything you need to live is here. The Room Key is all-powerful. You can use it to buy food, jewelry, and to clean your clothes, all without a single reach of the wallet.

As a new morning comes, the being continues beating. Supplying blood into every extremity from its center. And as problems arrive, they are dealt with, leaving no abnormalities.

This is the Hotel Platon.
