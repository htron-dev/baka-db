    "sinopse": "This work is known as a gag manga with a surrealistic twist, featuring a mysterious alien named Father and a boy presented as his son, Onnasky. Longing to become popular among women, they make bizarre plans every day in their apartment to pick up girls. Then they go to town, enact their stupid plans, and go home in vain. In this series, no detailed information is provided about the characters. Their conversation does not make sense sometimes, and Father's face is drawn intentionally out of proportion. These features generate uncomfortable, \"off-key\" feelings that result in a unique, peculiar humor, which is loved by many enthusiastic fans.\n\n(Source: tsoj.manga.org)",
