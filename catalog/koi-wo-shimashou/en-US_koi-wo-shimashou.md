A collection of salaryman stories.

1. Koi wo Shimashou
   Management consultant Kobayashi uses his work to pick up younger men who catch his eye. Unfortunately, on his latest project he finds himself stuck with morose middle-aged manager Chief Araki. Kobayashi's initial horror develops into professional respect and instead of cruising for guys, he decides to use his easygoing charm to strike up an unlikely friendship.
