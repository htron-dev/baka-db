## Sinopse

Shy, unconfident Tsubasa has just transferred to the Seiko Academy, where the Headmaster takes one look at him and assigns him to the Elite V Class. A genius at ferreting out hidden talent (especially good looks), the principal sees that Tsubasa can fulfill an emergency need—substitute for the female idol Yui Hoshino, for whom he is an exact double! Unable to dismiss the perks of being in the VIP class, Tsubasa, with the help of classmates, members of the idol group RINXS, is swept away on a whirlwind of activities that seem to get him deeper and deeper into trouble!
