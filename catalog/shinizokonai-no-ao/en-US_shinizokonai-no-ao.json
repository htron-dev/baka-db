Around the same time, the student in question starts seeing a blue-skinned... thing that only he can see.\n\nA girl starts staying at home more after a car accident leaves her blind. But is she really alone in the house?\n\nA guy moves into an apartment whose previous owner is still around... in a different form. It turns out that the latter was murdered at the front door.\n\n(Source: MU)",
