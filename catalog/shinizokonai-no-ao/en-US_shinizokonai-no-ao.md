## Sinopse

Three stories with afterwords by both the mangaka and the writer (whose original work this manga is based on).

A new teacher proves to be popular with the students and parents. But one of his students feels like he is picking on him deliberately. Around the same time, the student in question starts seeing a blue-skinned... thing that only he can see.

A girl starts staying at home more after a car accident leaves her blind. But is she really alone in the house?

A guy moves into an apartment whose previous owner is still around... in a different form. It turns out that the latter was murdered at the front door.
