## Sinopse

A new reign has begun. Wolfgang Goldenleonard, formerly an illegitimate prince, has now become the emperor of his kingdom. In addition, he has obtained both the throne's power and the heart of Shin Soohyuk, the person who shaped him into the man he is today.

However, there is still a long way ahead before the entire kingdom grows accustomed to its new monarch. Between uncertainty regarding Wolfgang's authority and the lingering threat of a possible coup, Wolfgang and Shin must keep an eye on the throne to ensure the safety of His Majesty at all costs. Yet soon, their tumultuous relationship may become an obstacle for their plans and Shin's future goals.
