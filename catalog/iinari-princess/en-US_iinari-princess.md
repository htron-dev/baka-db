## Sinopse

First princess in line to the throne of the Principality of Rivetaria, Lena Reena Rene Risheranto, is an overseas student in Hyuuga Nobuyuki's class. She has silky blond hair, clear blue eyes and a childlike face on a developed body and her personality... is that of the ideal princess. But it is the Noble Princess' periodic bouts of defenseless that make for a heart pounding, ecchi love comedy.
