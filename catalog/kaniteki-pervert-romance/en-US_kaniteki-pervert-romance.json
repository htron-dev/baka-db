    "sinopse": "A lone wolf with a delinquent streak, Kashima enters high school with a reputation that scares off his classmates. Little do his classmates know, Kashima is not a typical delinquent: he is a masochist that enjoys being hit by guys. Ryouji Sanada, despite Kashima's reputation, goes out of his way to talk to Kashima on the first day of high school. Confused by Ryouji, Kashima rebuffs his handsome classmate. But, when Ryouji intervenes in one of Kashima's fights (and attempts to get off), Kashima realizes that Ryouji might just have a secret \"perversion\" too...\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
