## Sinopse

When Minato died in an unfortunate accident, he was reincarnated in a different world where magic was woefully underdeveloped. Superfluous magic circles. Barely working attack magics.

"What's with these inefficient magic?"

By getting rid of the excesses in the magic circle, the destructive capabilities of the magic can be multiplied! Furthermore, he creates the flawless Extreme magic with his own hands. With his boundless wisdom, Minato enhances magic beyond wonder. In no time, his magical powers and techniques outclassed anyone else's. In a world where magic was lost to the people, Minato is praised as an omnipotent wise man who controls all of the elements.

The tale of a wise man commanding the lost magic with overwhelming power starts now!
