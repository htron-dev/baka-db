## Sinopse

Chihiro, a middle-aged father who still thinks he's good-looking, lives together with his 12-year-old daughter, Shima. Is Shima irritated by her dad because she's going through puberty? Or is she just acting like a spoiled kid?

Asami Sekiya presents a realistic depiction of a girl in middle school.
