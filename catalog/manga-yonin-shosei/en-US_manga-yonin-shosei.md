## Sinopse

Four young Japanese men immigrate to San Francisco at the start of the 20th century. There they adopt American names and set out to learn western ways and seek their fortunes. Henry (the author’s alter ego) enrolls in art school to learn the western style of painting, Charlie studies American democracy, Fred plans to become a successful farmer, and Frank wants to be a prosperous merchant. Along the way they experience first hand the events affecting Northern California and the United States at that time; the 1906 earthquake, the World’s Fair, and World War I.
