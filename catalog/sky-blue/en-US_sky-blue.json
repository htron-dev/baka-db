    "sinopse": "Kazama's family died in a mysterious explosion when he was still young and since then, he has not been able to come to terms with their deaths or even with himself. He emotionally distances himself from everyone and his aggressive nature gets him the nickname \"Real Life Combat Game Character.\"\n\nYears later, Kazama, now in high school, gets close to death after a car accident. As he accepts his fate, Sky Blue enters his consciousness. Somehow related to the multicolored meteors that were seen all around the world on the same day of Kazama's near-fatal accident, Sky Blue is able to control his body. The teenage-looking Sky Blue is able to control Kazama's body movements and even his speech. He falls for the beautiful but cold Haioka Anna and when she gets kidnapped, Sky Blue takes over Kazama's body, unleashing enormous amounts of power and strength.\n\n(Source: MU)",
