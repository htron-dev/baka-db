## Sinopse

Saku used to get along with his little sister Ikumi, but now she always ignores him. He's at a complete loss, until one day he notices that her smartphone's search history syncs to the family computer whenever she recharges it. Saku begins sneaking peeks at her search history in order to better understand what she's thinking, and it's not always what he expects.
