Based on the Dragon's Dogma video game; the manga series is about the adventures of the Arisen Karol and his main pawn Elise.

Karol's simple life as a fisherman changed when his home village of Cassardis was attacked by a dragon, who then proceeds to consume his heart, marking him as the Arisen. Now he seeks to reclaim his heart and along the way, he learns more of what truly makes an Arisen and of the mysterious Pawn Legion.
