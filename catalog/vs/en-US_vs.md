## Sinopse

Sometimes it takes a person who has shared your dream to make it come true. For Reiji, a gifted violinist with no formal training, success may be the key to escaping from his miserable home life. Mitsuko was also a prodigy until an accident left her unable to play. Now she is going to help Reiji achieve the goal she could never attain. Passions and rivalries play out against the backdrop of the music world, while Reiji's family background provides intense, emotional drama. (sorce: CMX)

The final volume also contains the short story "Spica"
