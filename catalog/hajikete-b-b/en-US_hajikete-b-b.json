    "sinopse": "Airi is a talented young girl who dreams about making a big splash in show business one day. Unfortunately, she lives in a place called Okinawa. And that's the wrong place to be for little girls with stars in their eyes.\n\nBut hope springs eternal for all dreamers. Each week, a variety show called Boom Boom showcases fresh and exciting talent on TV. Airi decides she has to be on that show. With that goal in mind, she enrolls at an actor's school in the big city.\n\nInspired by her new environs, Airi is determined to turn the world on with her smile. But, of course, there are hundreds of other kids at school with the exact same dream. The competition is fierce, but with hard work and a whole lot of charm, Airi has taken her first step in becoming Japan's next big thing.\n\n(Source: MU)",
