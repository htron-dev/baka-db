## Sinopse

Chae Woon is the manager of ‘Haeoreum.’ She gets retaliated when she receives Bora’s outstretched hands in front of Eun Gyul, who is in bad terms with her since they were little. “If the thing you hate most is my forced kiss, what I hate most are people that step out during my performance.” Is this jealousy or passion for music?
