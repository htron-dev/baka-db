## Sinopse

A teacher's body is discovered on the ground. Did she jump from the building or was she pushed? Toyama, a burly but kind-hearted detective, goes undercover to find out the truth. His determination to solve this mystery is tested by the rowdy student body. But there's one student, in particular, who is going to occupy a lot of Toyama's time. Makoto is a troubled young man who can actually see the demons inside of people, which manifest themselves as visions of horrible monsters. This strange student's disturbing visions may provide the information that Toyama needs to crack the case!
