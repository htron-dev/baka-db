    "sinopse": "In a city that is neither small nor big, there's a mountain that people avoid. The undeveloped mountain isn't protected with a green belt nor is it a site of environmental conservation. The avoided, prohibited forest... With the dismal atmosphere and the rumors that whisper about the spirits, let it to be called Spirit Mountain.\n\nOn the mountain there's a house, a famed house of mediums that shows off their long glorious history of their heritage. Hence, it was once called Medium Mountain. But once, a long time ago, they said a Ninetails lived there... and was known as the Fox Mountain.\n\nBut now, 20 years later, a dark aura covered this isolated place...\n\n(Source: MU)",
