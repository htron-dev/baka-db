## Sinopse

In a city that is neither small nor big, there's a mountain that people avoid. The undeveloped mountain isn't protected with a green belt nor is it a site of environmental conservation. The avoided, prohibited forest... With the dismal atmosphere and the rumors that whisper about the spirits, let it to be called Spirit Mountain.

On the mountain there's a house, a famed house of mediums that shows off their long glorious history of their heritage. Hence, it was once called Medium Mountain. But once, a long time ago, they said a Ninetails lived there... and was known as the Fox Mountain.

But now, 20 years later, a dark aura covered this isolated place...
