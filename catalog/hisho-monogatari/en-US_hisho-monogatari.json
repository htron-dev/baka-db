    "sinopse": "He's cold-hearted and the worst boss ever...so why does she want to remain by his side?\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Olivia just got a job at a wildly successful company—Inferno. She was supposed to start a position in the accounting division, but when she got there on her first day, she was told to report to the CEO as his temporary secretary! Tucker is smart and level-headed in his decision-making, and as the CEO of Inferno he's become a billionaire. After Olivia finds out she'll be fired if she doesn't take the position, her tall, handsome boss appears. While fear and yearning tug her heart in different directions, Tucker makes a tyrannical declaration: \"Don't ask questions, don't give your opinion. Just do the work you're told to do.\"\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
