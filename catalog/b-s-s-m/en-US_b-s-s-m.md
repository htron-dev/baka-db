## Sinopse

A gentle and poignant story about two school friends Nao and Keima. After trying out some drugs out of curiosity, they "accidentally" take their relationship one step further. The lovable and carefree Keima seems oblivious to the more solemn Nao's feelings for him, but their relationship subtly develops as they grow throughout high school.
