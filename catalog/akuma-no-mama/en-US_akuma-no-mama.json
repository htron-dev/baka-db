    "sinopse": "For centuries, the demon Seere has prided himself on his work—granting the wishes of those he contracts with. Whether it's slaughtering their enemies or obtaining wealth beyond measure, anything is possible with his powerful magic. But Seere's latest summoner, Sakura Masuda, is unlike any he's dealt with before. Namely, she's only in fourth grade, and her wish is... for Seere to become her mama! Well, if that's what she desires, then that's what he will deliver—by becoming the greatest mama ever!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
