## Sinopse

MAGiMAGi is a story about a girl named Akira. Ever since she was little she's loved mythical fantasy books about magicians and can't wait to grow up to be an author so she can write about magic. She has always believed in magicians and she believes that one day a magician will appear and whisk her off to magical land so she can escape the world she lives in, where nobody is interested in magic or her dreams of magical worlds. And then, after another humdrum day in the real world, she falls through a manhole, and finds herself in what might just be the world she's been looking for... (Source: Wikipedia)
