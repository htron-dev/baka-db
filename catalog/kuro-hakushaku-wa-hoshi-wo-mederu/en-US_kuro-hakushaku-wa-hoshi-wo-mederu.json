    "sinopse": "A Cinderella story with a twist!\n\nEsther Mayfield is a normal sixteen-year-old girl in 19th Century London. Except, ever since she was a little girl, she could see \"ghosts.\" She lives in a small part of town and sells flowers to earn a living. She thought that she would continue to live like this forever. Until, one day, a handsome young Count appears in front of her. And he wants Esther to be his bride? Is he really the Prince Charming she has been waiting for?\n\n(Source: Phoenix Serenade Scans)",
