    "sinopse": "Day after day, Towa Tokiwagi spends all of his time toiling at his part-time job. His life was far from fulfilling. One day, by a strange coincidence, he gets involved with Rin Wakamiya, a beauty who was the most popular girl in his school. They weren't supposed to have anything to do with each other. And yet, this is how these two people gradually come to a compromise with each other's differences.\n\n(Source: Kakuyomu, translated)",
