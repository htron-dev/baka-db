## Sinopse

Tsubame, a high-schooler who possess an extraordinary sense of pitch, had become fearful of singing, something she once loved to do, due to her childhood trauma. However, on one evening, she came across DJ Yuma, who aims to be a composer, and upon sensing her hidden talent, he demands that she sings his song. DJ Yuma forms a band with his best friend Shiori, who aims to be a filmmaker. "'For some reason, his music makes me feels at ease" Yuma and Shiori, the two bishounen, gave Tsubame the courage to sing again.
