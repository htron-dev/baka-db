## Sinopse

College ikemen, all-around nice guy Nana-kun wants to graduate from being a virgin and fit the 'cool' womanising image that everyone has of him. He asks the blunt and openly gay Mizuno for help to practice and prepare for a heterosexual relationship. In typical yaoi fashion, things don't go as planned.
