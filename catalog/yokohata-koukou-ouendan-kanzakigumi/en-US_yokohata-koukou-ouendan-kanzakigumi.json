    "sinopse": "The high school cheer squad might sound like sissy stuff. However, as Hiroshi Fujishiro finds out, it's anything but. Join the Kanazakigumi as they flaunt their manliness and sense of justice while braving a villainous principal, stalkers, drug dealers, yakuza and even star in an adult film. Nothing is beyond their abilities. The only question is; with all this going on, how do they find time to cheer?",
