    "sinopse": "A poor baron daughter has lived under her sister's shadow, where she always had nothing. Her hair is full or hairballs, she doesn't have a single dress, and all she has are tattered clothes for work. Her sister receives the attention of a high rich noble, but she dies on the way to her marriage.\n\nMarie is sent as a substitute bride for her sister because the baron cannot repay the already sold dowry to the earl. But... that's impossible? In the first place, the proposal was a misunderstanding? A beautiful and happy story of love about a fallen baron's daughter and an eloquent earl.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
