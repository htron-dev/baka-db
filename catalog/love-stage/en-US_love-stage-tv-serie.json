However, aside from a commercial for a wedding magazine when he was a child, Izumi has never been in the spotlight; instead, he aims to become a manga artist.\n\nBut a decade after the shoot, the magazine calls for a 10th anniversary ad, requesting the original child actors for the project.

However, due to Izumi's feminine appearance and unisex name, Ryouma believed the boy was a girl and continues to do so to this day. Izumi's troubles are just beginning, because even after discovering the truth, Ryouma can't seem to shake off his feelings...\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
