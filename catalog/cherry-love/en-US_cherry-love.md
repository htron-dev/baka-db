Contains one main story and two one-shots.

The heroine is a girl who has no clue about romance.

Her point of view:
My childhood friend is a cute guy, and he always come to my house in the morning to wake me up. Although he can be quite mean sometimes, being with him makes me feel very happy. But, once the fact that we're not dating became known, many girls began to hit on him, and start to confess. But, it seems that I feel something towards him lately! What ever should I do now?
