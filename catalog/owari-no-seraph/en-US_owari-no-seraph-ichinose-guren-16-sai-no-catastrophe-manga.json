    "sinopse": "A thousand years ago, the Hiiragi Family founded a powerful religious organization known as the Order of the Imperial Demons. Five hundred years later, the Ichinose Family split from the syndicate to establish the Order of the Imperial Moon—an organization that rivals the Hiiragi Family's reign. As the price for leaving, the Hiiragi implemented a system that aimed to oppress the next Ichinose head at a school they administer.\n\nForced to follow tradition, Guren Ichinose, a sorcerer and potential heir to the Ichinose Family, enrolls into First Shibuya High. While in enemy territory, Guren must hide his true strength at all times, even if this means that he has to endure blows from fellow classmates. Despite maintaining a low profile at school, he catches the interest of Mahiru Hiiragi—the successor of the Hiiragi Family whom he was close with long ago. With news of a chaotic event arising from the shadows, Guren yearns for power but remains ignorant about his acquaintance, who somehow shares the same sentiment.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
