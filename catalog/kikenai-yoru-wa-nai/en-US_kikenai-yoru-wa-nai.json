    "sinopse": "From midnight until the farewell ceremony, when all the street lights have gone out. A person dubbed \"the Listener\" will hear the stories of those who lost their loved ones. Sentences that have yet to be voiced, feelings that have yet to be shown. Tonight he listens to it all, lends a hand to them all, becomes their only companion. Listen about the dead, for the sake of the living.\n\nA drama full of tears for those who stay behind.\n\n(Source: MU)",
