It seems like Katsuya is having problems recalling the incident and couldn’t even remember how she died in the first place. To makes matters worse for poor Katsuya, he harbours conflicting feelings that are beyond what a son would normally feel for a father. Thus, life with Tooru during his puberty is pure torture. One day, he met a man claimed to be his deceased mother’s old friend. He was told that his mother perished in a hit-and-run accident and that even until today, the culprit hadn’t been caught yet. Katsuya embarks on a journey to find the killer while battling his sinful feelings for his foster father, Tooru…\n\n(Source: Echochi Scans)",
