## Sinopse

1. Dear Devil
   Police Detective Kisegawa had been overseeing the training of newbie Hiiragi. Before Hiiragi left for his training in Osaka he confessed to Kisegawa and the Detective, who did not want to disappoint Hiiragi had told him he'd not consider it before Hiiragi returns holding the number one place in arrests - never imagining that his clumsy trainee could ever succeed. But now Hiiragi has returned as the number one of Osaka and he's starting to pursue Kisegawa seriously.

2. Live for the Moment
   The surgeon Tachibana had left his male lover and decided to live a lie and get married to the daughter of the hospital director for the sake of his carreer and social standing. But an encounter with a young and spontaneous Noh actor makes him doubt his decision.

Also contains a mini extra to the first story.
