## Sinopse

Sports comedy with psychic powers. The story revolves around six children and a cat who save a religious icon from a fire, in reward for which the temple god grants each of them a power that will activate on their 13th birthday. Upon entering junior high school together, the six are forced to join the Sports Rental Club, which provides temporary members to other clubs when the regular members can't participate. The main character is Misora, a straight forward type of girl who likes physical activities like kickboxing.
