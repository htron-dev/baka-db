    "sinopse": "All of the girls at his college love Suou Tsukasa and come up to talk to him on a daily basis. Unfortunately for them, Tsukasa hates girls that are straightforward like that but is too nice of a guy to tell them that. In fact, he has a crush on Kizaki Megumu, his classmate and one of the shy and least talkative girls. The professor in one of the classes they have together is Dr. Hime, a young teacher whose childish looks and short height makes her a target for her students to jokingly tease and treat her more like their friend rather than a professor. After taking home the drunk Ms. Hime who was served lots of alcohol by her students, Tsukasa learns a giant secret about her love life.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
