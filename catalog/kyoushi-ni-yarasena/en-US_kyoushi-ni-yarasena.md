## Sinopse

24 year old Juri IKEUCHI is quite the scandalous teacher. She races around in a red convertible, she smokes at school, and she dresses with daring style definitely not suitable for a teacher. Almost immediatley after her arrival at school, she clashes with 17 year old student Tadashi KAKEI. He is Juri's opposite. He is an extremely straightlaced, by-the-books, intelligent student. He doesn't think much of IKEUCHI-sensei's flaunting of the rules. Of course, once IKEUCHI-sensei realizes how cute KAKEI is without his glasses, well, the hunt is on!
