Nana, young boy with amnesia, has forgotten even his name. During one of his journeys, he is powerless to protect two children who are killed during an attack on a village. After the horrific experience, he resolves to eradicate war from the earth. He then joins Tripeace, a small group of activists who are willing to use any means necessary, even violence, to end war. Should peace be protected whatever the cost?
