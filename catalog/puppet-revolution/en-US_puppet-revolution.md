## Sinopse

Kota is an easy-going, absent-minded boy. One day, an evil puppet-like creature from outer space, with big cute eyes, comes along and kidnaps his right arm. The alien is named Eichi, and he is out to conquer Planet Earth. In no time, however, that plan goes amuck, and the whole neighborhood is reduced to chaos, not least because Kota's big-breasted girlfriend Erika enters the picture.
