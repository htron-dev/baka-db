    "sinopse": "This old classic is the story of Hyoudo Shin, the son of professional golfer Hyoudo Masashi. He idolizes his father, but they’ve never played together – not since the death of his mother. Masashi demands a certain level of proficiency from his son before they can play together, but when he reaches that level (still in grade school) his father is coaching someone else – the son of a rival who can no longer play. So what else can Shin do? Become the rival of the kid his father is coaching! Actually, that’s not what this manga is about – there’s a switch. You’re told that story so that you can then discover the real story – that of Hoshino Subaru – the son of a former golf pro now in a wheelchair. He had to give up basketball because he has a heart condition, but golf? He just might be gifted at that, with a swing that hooks his ball high in the sky…\n\n(Source: MU)",
