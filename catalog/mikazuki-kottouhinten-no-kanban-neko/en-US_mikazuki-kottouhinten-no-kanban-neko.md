## Sinopse

Mimori, one who lacks socialization skill, is dragged by a suspicious man, Tsukimiya one day on the street as he finds himself becoming the storekeeper of an antique shop. But, why is his body reacting to the scent of incense in the shop, one that is said to be the inheritance of the Tsukimiya family?!
