For some reason, Kazuki had been creating a rocket all by himself. Kanae get deflated when she finds out his unexpected goal, but winds up working with him to complete the rocket! And so begins this unexpected story of Kanae and Kazuki, which ties into them seeing a UFO when they were in grade school.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
