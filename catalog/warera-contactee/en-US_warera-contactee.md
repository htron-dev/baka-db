## Sinopse

A tired, fed up office worker and that weird kid from her elementary school work together to build a rocket to space in this charming short series.

Kanae, now a dull office worker, happens to meet up with her former classmate from grade school, Kazuki Nakahira. For some reason, Kazuki had been creating a rocket all by himself. Kanae get deflated when she finds out his unexpected goal, but winds up working with him to complete the rocket! And so begins this unexpected story of Kanae and Kazuki, which ties into them seeing a UFO when they were in grade school.
