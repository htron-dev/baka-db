    "sinopse": "At the end of her senior year, the charismatic Hiroko Yagami confessed her feelings to Sono Ikeda, her beautiful best friend. But Sono rejected Hiroko's feelings and moved to Tokyo, far away from her.\n\nThree years later, Hiroko also lives in Tokyo with her new girlfriend, Satomi Yagami, wasting her days playing video games and waiting for Satomi to return home. However, Satomi reaches her limit when, during an intimate moment, Hiroko says Sono's name. Feeling tired and betrayed, Satomi kicks Hiroko out of her apartment.\n\nHomeless, broke, and devoid of hope, Hiroko is forced to sleep under a bridge. However, on a cold rainy night, a familiar beautiful girl shows up and offers Hiroko help when she needs it most.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
