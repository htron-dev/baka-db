    "sinopse": "Kyouichi is a fashion major at the Mishima Design Academy. He divides his smooth-sailing school days between class and the cosplay club, hanging out with a different girl every day. ...Or, well, he used to. Ever since he saw his friend Umi decked out in a suit fit for a prince, Kyouichi's been feeling awkward around him. He keeps touching himself while thinking of being tied up by Umi. Girls are getting pissed off that he can't perform for them anymore—his life's being turned upside-down! Then, when he's at a photo exhibition headhunting a photographer for a club project, Kyouichi gets headhunted by the photographer to model for him... tied up and nude! Little does Kyouichi know that by accepting the job, he'll come face to face with desires he never even knew he had...! This is a brand new installment of romantic adventures at our favorite cosplay club!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
