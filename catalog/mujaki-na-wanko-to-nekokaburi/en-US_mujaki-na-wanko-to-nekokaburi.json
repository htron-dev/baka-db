    "sinopse": "Yagi Naohito has a fear of being hated, so he always acts according to everyone’s ideals. With that mindset, he is half-jokingly labeled a coward by Akasaka Tooru, a guy he meets at a mixer. Yagi didn’t think they’d meet again a few days later.\n\nAs a favor to Akasaka, who has just lost his home and is at his wit’s end, they start living together. The man who starts out as nothing but a burden gradually becomes someone Yagi can rely on..?\n\n(Source: MU)",
