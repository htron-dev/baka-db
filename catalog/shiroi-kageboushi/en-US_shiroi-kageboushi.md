## Sinopse

Suzuko Hasebe, a 11th grade student, has been on a consistent transfer from one school to another (due to her father's work) before transferring to a private school. When she arrived, she saw an empty desk sitting by the window of the classroom and was given permission to sit there. No one has sat at that desk for 5 years, and strange things are about to occur.

Included one-shot: Futari no Melody (Melody for Two)
