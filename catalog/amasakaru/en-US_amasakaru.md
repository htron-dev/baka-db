## Sinopse

Once there was a warrior from the noble class who tried to overthrow the court. He failed and died. His wife was taken and married off to his enemy, and his three sons were fostered in different monasteries. These sons, each gifted in the arts of war, grow up and seek to destroy the men who killed their father. But sibling rivalry and jealousy are more dangerous than the battlefield. The youngest brother, a delicate beauty in the bedroom and a demon on the battlefield is particularly vulnerable. Will he ever find comfort and love, and with who?
