## Sinopse

Nishimori, a police officer who's looking for a girlfriend, is told by a shady fortune teller that he will meet his soul mate tomorrow at midnight! He's overjoyed, but his soul mate doesn't show up. Instead, he meets a weird long-haired guy named Makino, and ends up staying the night with him! And for some reason, they start living together!
