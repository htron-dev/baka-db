## Sinopse

In Yoshiwara (present-day Tokyo during the Edo Period), prostitution was abolished and brothels were restored in the red light district.

We meet several uke and seme, some of who are courtesans of the Men's Brother Quarters at Hanafurirou. Each couple has its own circumstances and story, each in their own volume.
