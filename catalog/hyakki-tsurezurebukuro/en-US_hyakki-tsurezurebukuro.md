## Sinopse

In 1950s Tokyo, only the Rose Cross Detective Agency can tackle the cases that the police won't touch. Enokizu is an eccentric private eye with psychic abilities, and Chuuzenji is a surly used book store owner with an encyclopaedic knowledge of obscure trivia. Together with their associates, they seek justice for the victims.
