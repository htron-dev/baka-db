Munematsu - the manager of the host club that has recently opened in the shopping street of a small town - meets the timid representative for the neighborhood council, Tooru. At first, Munematsu believes he's just a quiet four-eyes, but the drunk Tooru is more seductive than expected and Munematsu starts to feel attracted to him. But the reason why Tooru doesn't let Munematsu touch him is.....!?

The comic romance of the handsome host and the plain recycle shop owner!
