## Sinopse

When she was seventeen, Angela fell pregnant—but she was poor and decided to give the baby up for adoption. Then one day she finds out that the couple who adopted her baby died in an unfortunate accident. Worrying about her child, Angela desperately searches out the child's guardian, Nick, the younger brother of her child's adoptive mother. Nick lives in London, runs a multinational business and is so busy that he's looking for a nanny for the niece he has recently taken in. And so Angela hides her true identity in order to see her daughter and become the girl's nanny.
