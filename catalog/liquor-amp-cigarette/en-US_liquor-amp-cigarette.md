## Sinopse

Theo runs the town liquor store—too bad he's a total lightweight! His lifelong best friend, Camilo, runs the cigarette store across the street, and recently, he's been making his attraction to Theo quite clear. Unsure of how he feels about dating a man, Theo accepts Camilo's offer of a trial run at dating, and with a little liquid courage and a lot of heavy petting, Theo sees a whole new side to his childhood friend. Will these new experiences clarify his feelings or only serve to further muddy the waters of love?
