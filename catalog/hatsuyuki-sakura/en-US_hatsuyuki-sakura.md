## Sinopse

Kawano Hatsuyuki is a third-year student, one of the rare delinquents at his school. He reluctantly shows up in order to fulfill his graduation requirements.

It's December, and the first snow of the year has fallen. In one lot of the old town, Hatsuyuki encounters a beautiful girl wearing a white dress. She's wandering the streets under the falling snow, in search of a rabbit. A few days later, the girl in the dress—Tamaki Sakura—transfers into his school. To take Hatsuyuki along towards the last winter.

With the turn of the four seasons, 1095 days come to an end. Soon winter will pass, and spring will arrive. Embracing memories of snow that never accumulated, the youth stands perfectly still.

From the first snow (Hatsuyuki) to the cherry blossoms (Sakura), congratulations on your graduation.
