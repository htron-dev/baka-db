## Sinopse

Akito has always been in his older brother's shadow, but all that changes when Shinkai offers to send him to study abroad... though, it's not any 'abroad' he's ever heard of! Suddenly trapped in a world full of warlocks, poisonous bugs, and more than a few secrets, Akito and his friend Yaya have nothing but their wits and the help of a mysterious benefactor named Neon... who seems to know a little too much about Akito's brother!
