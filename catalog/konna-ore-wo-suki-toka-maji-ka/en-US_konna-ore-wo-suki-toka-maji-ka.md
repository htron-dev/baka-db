## Sinopse

Even though cafe owner Mugimaru is good looking, rumors say he's a playboy. But that doesn't stop the pessimistic, anti-social, and overly serious salaryman Roku from going there since he likes how the owner makes his coffee. However, one day the drunk Mugimaru pushes Roku down and says, "Since you like my cafe, that means you like me too, right?" What will happen between salaryman Roku and the psychopathic owner, Mugi?!
