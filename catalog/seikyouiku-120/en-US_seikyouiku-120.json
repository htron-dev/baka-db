    "sinopse": "Let's talk about sex.\n\n​Naoko Tsuji, an unorthodox health teacher at an all-girls school, doubts whether the sex ed status quo truly teaches young people everything they need to know—so she ramps it up to 120%! Luckily for Tsuji, her class proves to be an almost unflappable group, including a BL fan, a lesbian, and a girl who just really likes her cat! With topics like safe sex for same-gender couples, masturbation positivity, and why sugar gliders have three vaginas, this sex education comedy is more than just dirty jokes. It's time for class!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
