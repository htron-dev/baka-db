After seeing a commercial for a toy robot, he desperately wants one, thinking the robot will give him the strength to change. The only one he can afford, though, is a broken one a rich school bully threw in the trash. When Lina, a pretty cheerleader who's always been nice to him, is kidnapped, will Joey and his toy robot be able to become heroes and rescue her?",
