## Sinopse

Joey wants to be a hero, but he's just an orphan who works day and night to take care of himself and his grandmother. After seeing a commercial for a toy robot, he desperately wants one, thinking the robot will give him the strength to change. The only one he can afford, though, is a broken one a rich school bully threw in the trash. When Lina, a pretty cheerleader who's always been nice to him, is kidnapped, will Joey and his toy robot be able to become heroes and rescue her?
