    "sinopse": "Seiji Aino is an ordinary student living a seemingly boring life, until a strange girl calling herself Guri shows up at his doorstep and claims that if Seiji does not kiss someone, she will die. Ignoring the event as some sort of attempted religious soliciting, Seiji closes the door and walks away, only to find that Guri can phase right through it!\n\nGuri wields a \"Kiss Note,\" a powerful magical notebook that can cause two people to instantly fall in love if their names are written in it. As a cupid, it is Guri's duty to use the notebook to create couples. And as it turns out, she accidentally wrote Seiji's name in the book, forcing him to complete the pair by finding someone to kiss.\n\nAt a loss for words, Seiji believes Guri's ridiculous story and kisses his crush Akane Hiyama, the school's most popular girl. But Akane's feelings for Seiji go far beyond what would be considered normal, and she develops an obsession with him. As if things couldn't get more ludicrous, Guri announces that she also harbors feelings for him, marking the start of Seiji's chaotic and comedic love life. Will either girl be able to win Seiji's affection, or will their personal lives interrupt their dreams?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
