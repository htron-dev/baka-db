    "sinopse": "As the second eldest son in a big, poverty-stricken family, Kazuomi Kouno has to look after his younger siblings. At school, he's the low-energy-consuming cool boy. He was only devoted to his family before, but his senior of 2 years, Koutarou Makise, forces him to join the Gardening Association. Despite being bewildered by Koutarou's excessive physical contact and friendliness, Kazuomi slowly opens up to him, the first senior he got along with. However, he witnesses Koutarou, the number one most popular guy in school, showing his free-spirited nature regarding relationships, and Kazuomi's heart trembles in pain.\n\n(Source: Takeshobo, translated)",
