## Sinopse

Ootsuki and Tsubaki have been best friends since their college years and are now colleagues at the same university. They can seemingly talk and confide with each other about anything and spent a lot of time together. However, there is a rumor floating about that Ootsuki carries a woman’s photo in his wallet. Tsubaki is shocked—does Ootsuki have a secret girlfriend?!
