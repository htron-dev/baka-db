## Sinopse

There's an old legend that a monk and a Tengu (Heaven Dog - 天狗) is rival. Kiyomi is a monk who was saved by a girl named Sasuka. While staying there, he found out that there were girls who went missing. Villagers think the culprit is a Tengu. Is the Tengu really culprit? And somehow it seems that Sasuka relates with Tengu. And somehow Kiyomi is just a fake monk?
