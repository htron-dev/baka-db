## Sinopse

This is not your everyday manga. It strictly deals with cases of intersexuality. I.S. stands for Inter Sexuality.

This manga deals with the struggles of intersex people: the pain they go through, the troubles they confront, and ultimately their inability to reproduce or even find a partner who will accept them as they are.

The series broken down into individual cases; each deals with different people, though some cases are much longer and more dramatic than others.
