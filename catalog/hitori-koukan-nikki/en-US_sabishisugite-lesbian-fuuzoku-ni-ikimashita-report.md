## Sinopse

After her life takes a turn for worse shortly after dropping out of college, Kabi Nagata becomes depressed and develops an eating disorder. She feels immense pressure from her family to be a "normal" and productive person, along with an acute desire to belong to a community. Despite attempts to solve these problems, she struggles to resolve her pain, and her situation worsens.

At 28 years old, Kabi contacts a lesbian escort service. She imagines this event as a rite of passage into adulthood she has been avoiding for so long. And while this experience does not turn out to be exactly what she was expecting, it proves critical to Kabi's reimagining of her life.
