## Sinopse

Jealous of other people successfully moving forward in life and constantly eaten away by her insecurities, Kabi Nagata finally musters the courage to leave her parents and move into a new apartment alone. Unfortunately, she struggles to adapt to this new lifestyle and begins to contemplate her newfound feelings of loneliness, including her estranged relationship with her mother and what it means to love and be loved. As the psychological pressure mounts, her resolve waivers.

From her family to love, Nagata attempts to overcome her tumultuous past and heal the wounds that afflict her. No matter how broken she may be, she does her best to move forward.
