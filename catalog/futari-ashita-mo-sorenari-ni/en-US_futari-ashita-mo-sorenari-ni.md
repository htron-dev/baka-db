## Sinopse

After dating for a year and three months, the unruffled Yuuya Aida asks his beautiful girlfriend Rio Aihara to move in with him. Despite busy work schedules and their age difference, their love for each other never wavers.

Be it frisky fights over who ate the last pudding or serious conversations about their future together, Yuuya and Rio still find themselves nervous and bashful around each other, reminiscent of the early days of their relationship. Yet their adorable everyday dynamic is nothing short of the joy and giddiness of a couple's true love.
