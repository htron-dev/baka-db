## Sinopse

When Chinatsu joined the student council, she found it wasn't nearly as cool as she had expected. The president just slept all the time, and the vice president just did paperwork. There was no fighting evil, no sex appeal... just normal school stuff. It's up to Chinatsu to liven things up!
