## Sinopse

Taking place at the end of the 22nd century Earth, the world is cold and hard. After being wracked with many wars the earth has become infertile, civilized conveniences are controlled by the military, top corporations, and high ranking officials. Most people survive through sheer stubbornness and are surrounded by crime and poverty.
