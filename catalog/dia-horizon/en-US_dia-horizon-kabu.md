## Sinopse

We met and shared one death in two lives.

What's beyond the end of the horizon? Death… hope… freedom… A girl was born with the secret to the end. She... is not allowed to live freely. "Freedom" was just a word she yearns for. She lived in a closed and narrow world. Her life is chosen by someone. Therefore, she thought, if the God only gives me a scenario with no freedom, I want to share the "death" with you, not that "someone." I want to give the half of destiny to her, even if I have to share the "death" with her.
