## Sinopse

The Second World War is about to blow. The brothers Elen and Maximillian are students that struggle at becoming part of nazist organizations.

Elen meets Alex in a short trip. A few years later, they meet again and find out they're in love for each other. But they're emotionally wounded by the war and stay apart.

Occasionally, the three of them get closer, but that's just the start of the tragedy.
