## Sinopse

Ninny Spangcole is the leader of popular girl group, Cecile Die Twice, but her ambitions stretch far beyond a successful music career. In the hidden underground world of Reverse London, Ninny and her partner Noel "Niiha" Niihashi strive to achieve loftier goals as "Witches," members of the organization Wing Bind which is dedicated to the handling of dragons. These powerful creatures once caused over half of all casualties in the city proper, prior to Reverse London splitting away from Front London. As dragons are invisible to most Front Londoners, their existence has become a mere myth, and Reverse Londoners have taken up the front lines. Thus, Wing Bind was created, prohibiting non-licensed individuals from coming into any contact with dragons.

Ninny and Noel have their work cut out for them when they are assigned as the caretakers of Balgo Ywain Parks and his dog Osushi-chan. With trouble persistently trailing close behind him, the two girls are left to deal with the aftermath. Even more problems arise when Macy Baljure, Ninnyâ€™s former bandmate, appears in Reverse London with a dragon by her side.
