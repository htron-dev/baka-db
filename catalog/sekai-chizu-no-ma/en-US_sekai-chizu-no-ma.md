## Sinopse

Guys visit a city. They watch airplanes departing and arriving at an airport. They go on board a ship and across a river. Finally they arrive at a building as their destination. A man guides them to the"world map room." It seems they have an appointment there, although there is no description about the appointment. They see books on the shelves and have some desultory conversation. Then they go to the courtyard and carry on the conversation. They reach a pond with a sunken ship. The guide starts to explain the ship's history. The book ends.
