    "sinopse": "Hopeless about the future, 18-year-old Han Soo-Bum prepares to jump off a building. Suddenly blinded by a flash, he notices an unfamiliar man taking pictures of him. As he is about to complain, police officers storm the rooftop, declaring the stranger, Lee Hyuk-Soo, as the prime suspect in a murder case.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, Soo-Bum is taken hostage and finds himself on the road with the 25-year-old fugitive. A fearless captive and a falsely accused man on the run, the polar opposites begin to ignite hope in each other's pitiful yet complex lives.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
