Chihiro is the heir to Tsurumaruya, an old, well-established Japanese confectionary. He is secretly in love with Katsumi, a childhood friend, who is also the manager of the store. His feelings for the over-protective Katsumi keep growing, but Katsumi wants to fulfill the last wish of the previous owner and live his life as the manager.

With the two of them unable to connect their feelings, Chihiro is asked to go to Tokyo by an important customer.
