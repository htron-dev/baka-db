    "sinopse": "Have you ever daydreamed about the quiet, handsome guy at the train station?  How about the awkward boy who works at the corner boutique... or that college crush who now works in your office?  The world is filled with men who are fuel for fantasy, and Love Bus Stop is a non-stop ride down streets made for illicit crushes, secret love affairs and quiet bedroom trysts.  Let your mind wander, and your body will surely follow...\n\n(Source: Juné Manga)",
