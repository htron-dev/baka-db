## Sinopse

When I opened my eyes, I somehow was in a monster house! The class idol became a slime! That quiet librarian girl became a succubus! And I became a skeleton... Everyone was reincarnated into strong and awesome monsters, yet I am a useless protagonist.

This is the story of how he who became a weak skeleton will rise in status within his class.
