    "sinopse": "Kawakami is a top student with a penchant for donuts. Kaji is a troublemaker who fell deeply in love with Kawakami. Although they ignore each other at school, when they're all alone... they eat, kiss and... play. “You're so annoying!” is Kawakami's favorite line, but there's much more than meets the eye. A cute story of an unusual first love!\n\n(Source: Nakama)",
