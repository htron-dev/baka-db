## Sinopse

Kei, an ordinary high school teacher, and Haruto, a popular model brimming talent and blessed with an abundance of good looks were raised as non-blood related brothers.

The focus of his younger brother is extreme fixation. Kei engages in a relationship which is more than familial. Although confused, Kei accepts this as a status quo. However, one day, Haruto's real father appears and...?!

A love-story spun on the foundation of ill-fated destiny.
