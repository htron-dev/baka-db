## Sinopse

Take has been watching Kamita-san single-handedly take care of his young daughter Mone for quite a while now. When Kamita’s wife finally shows her face at the shop only after Kamita has gone home, Take can’t help but demand an explanation for why she’d abandon her family with such a great husband and daughter. But when Kamita’s wife blurts out “because he told me he’s gay!” it’s definitely the last thing Take was expecting!
