    "sinopse": "A young office lady's life in modern-day Japan used to be consumed by the neverending tedium of her desk job; her only solace was reading web novels. One particular story caught her eye, about the Baroness Misano defeating the noblewoman Ronia Gavisera and winning the heart of Ronia's ex-fiancé Schneider. After finishing the novel, she couldn't help but wish there had been a more peaceful conclusion—and this was her last thought before she died.\n\nIn her next life, she is reborn as the very same Ronia whom she had pitied. This time however, she resolves to remain free from the conflict between herself and Misano. However, the plot of the novel cannot change, and despite never instigating anything, Ronia is expelled from school, disowned by her family, and her engagement is ruined.\n\nThis is not Ronia's downfall; this is her chance at freedom! Free of her past, she opens up a cafe, leisurely spending her days with a piping cup of coffee. Soon, this peaceful life gains a new splendor with the arrival of four beast-kin, a race of human-animal hybrids. While most shy away from them in fear, Ronia can't help but be enchanted by their fluffiness!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
