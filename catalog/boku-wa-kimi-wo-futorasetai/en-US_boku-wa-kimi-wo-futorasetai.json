    "sinopse": "Miyakoda Eri just returned to Japan after living in France, and she's lost a lot of weight because Japanese food doesn't fit her palate. But suddenly, an infectious disease ravages the country, and her surroundings have become a disaster zone! Luckily she's with Kino Kouichi, her coworker, and he uses his survival skills to make meals for her. But he'll use literally anything as ingredients, even bugs and grass, and he says that he wants to fatten her back up?! Maybe she isn't so lucky after all...\n\n[Written by Denji]",
