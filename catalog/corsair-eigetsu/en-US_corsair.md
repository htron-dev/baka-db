## Sinopse

The Morea sea is controlled by a clan name Preveza, a clan which has lost all ties to any other country in the past three years. At this critical moment the leader of the armada, Ayace "the devil killer" Malik is foremost in ensuring Preveza's continued existence. Also among the major figures of Preveza is the strategist Canale, favoured by the "princess" of the clan, Aura. However the trouble fomenting due to Canale's mysterious past is soon to change both the relationship between Canale and Ayace and the future of the Preveza clan.
