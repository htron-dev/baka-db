Yani, the young prime minister of the empire of Pisar, wanted to see his dear childhood friend, the beautiful attorney general, Sesaam purely as a friend. But it seems his heart isn't following his mind. On one hand he's facing the facts that he wants Sesaam as his lover but on another hand he didn't want to destroy the trust he had build for years with Sesaam due to his selfish feelings. Then, all of a sudden, Sesaam told him he could have sex with him...!?
