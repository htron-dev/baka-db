## Sinopse

When Tatsuhiko Kido moves to the city to attend art school, all he wants is a normal college life full of fun, friends, and cute girls. But his life takes a dramatic change when he peers through a hole in his apartment wall and sees his neighbor Emiru Ikuno masturbating while facing his direction. To make matters worse, he was caught peeping by Emiru, so he barges into the next room to apologize. Unfortunately, he falls into a compromising position with Emiru who quickly snaps a photo and blackmails him into having a mutual peeping relationship. And to make matters more interesting, he learns that Emiru is in his class at school!

Although initially curious and only somewhat peeved by their relationship, it begins tearing at Kido's psyche, his sanity, and the relationships he has with other women. Despite its smutty appearance, Nozoki Ana is a deeply psychological story about guilt, eroticism, and finding love in strange places.
