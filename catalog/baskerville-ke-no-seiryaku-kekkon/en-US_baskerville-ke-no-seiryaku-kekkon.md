## Sinopse

Baskerville, the family of tragedy.

Sophia, the daughter of a wealthy family, is to marry Gwyn Baskerville, the young heir of the Baskerville family who succeeded the title at the mere age of thirteen. After the recent death of his family, Gwyn, the "tragedy boy" was thrown into the public eye. Although Sofia manages to establish a good relationship with Gwyn, she holds a secret that, when uncovered, will keep everyone away.

This is the tale of a boy seeking the truth of his family's death and a girl who can see the dead as their bond grows deeper and deeper.
