Her search takes her deep into the West—which is a good thing, because the agitated horse that comes into her possession will only run in that direction!\nThings get more twisted when Naomi interrupts a duel between an outlaw and a bounty hunter—and each of them suddenly believes he is related to her. The outlaw thinks Naomi's his sister and the bounty hunter is convinced he's her dad!\"\n\n(Source: back cover)",
