## Sinopse

In an age of chaos, the four governing spirits of wind, water, fire, and earth reigned. There were those who could harness that power to cast spells, and there were a few who were blessed with the ability to hear the spirits’ voices, and those people were endowed with the ability to control the “Darkness Rage”, “Luciffis” . . .
Twins, Rudius and Mattie, are on the run, trying to escape the Spell-Caster Monks, who are trying to capture them to take the Luciffis. When the two are separated, Mattie turns to a fortune teller named Kishiru Mishuru to enlist her help in locating her missing brother, and that’s where the story begins . . . (Source: Cireus-Anime)
