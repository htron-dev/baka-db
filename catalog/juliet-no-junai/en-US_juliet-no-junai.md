## Sinopse

Novice stage actress Mina loses her heart to a man in the audience. After the show, the extremely sexy man introduces himself as Aksel, and the two rush into a night of passion. The next morning, however, Mina learns that Aksel is the archduke of the northern monarchy of Storvhal. On top of that, she finds out that pictures of the two of them entering the hotel have been leaked online. Aksel mistakenly assumes Mina has used him to make a name for herself, so he denounces her and disappears!
