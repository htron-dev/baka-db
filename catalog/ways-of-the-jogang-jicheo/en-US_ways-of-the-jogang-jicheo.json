Who cares about that kind of thing!\"\n\n\"Oh goodness, our neighbors, just listen to the way he's talking. I'm telling you to keep the promise, since it's a vow between two households! It's not as if I've become your manura Because I wanted to be!!!\"\n\nAll of women virtues are; One: Carefulness of conduct, Two: Carefulness of conduct. This is the way she was taught to act, Genuine country maiden Kim Seon-Nyeo.

It's actually taming Jogang Jibu!\"\n\n(Source: MU)",
