## Sinopse

In 2015, strange beams of light are appearing with no explanation all over the earth. The antisocial teenage girl Takizawa has a "Planetary Seed" theory as to their origins and purpose. Takizawa's classmate Tsubura is more concerned with her everyday life and figuring out why her heart pounds so hard around her childhood friend, Koujirou. Soon, the two girls' world will collide, when Tsubura's love causes a "Planetary Seed" to rise up from beneath the Earth... carrying Tsubura, Koujirou, Takizawa and their entire school building with it!
