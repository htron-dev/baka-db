## Sinopse

A mysterious man, Hosumi, who suddenly appeared when Satsuki, a rural high school student, is in the middle of beating up some local punks.

He's terrified but he obeys Hosumi's orders since he's strong than Satsuki. He can't help but follow the mysterious man. And he even took Satsuki to his home!!? Despite being questioned, he can't keep up with the situation. He doesn't understand what's happening right now. Who on earth is this guy...? Moreover, Hosumi was a police officer.

A heartwarming but slightly dark story of a shy high school student and a mysterious police officer unfolding in a rural area.
