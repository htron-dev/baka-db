## Sinopse

Two endearing awkward men. Once they come face to face, Younosuke and Suzunari, both heirs of long-established tailors, immediately throw unpleasant sarcasms at each other. Just when Younosuke thought that their quarreling relationship would go on forever, he was told to go for a marriage interview... Would you like to try out this awkward kind of love spun by two young tailors?
