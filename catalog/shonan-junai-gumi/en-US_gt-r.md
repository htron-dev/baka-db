Being one of the few longtime friends with Onizuka (GTO), Danma Ryuji has seen all the fiascoes he has gotten into. But the motorcycle shop owner and self proclaimed fastest driver in the city is about to get into a world of trouble. A hot teenager named Ishikawa Mimon starts taking interest in Ryuji, but contrary to her appearance, she's a dangerous person that will put Ryuji into life threatening situations.
