## Sinopse

One day, a regular Earthling girl called Eri is visited by a pair of strange but somewhat cute aliens from the planet ‘Mal’, telling her that she has been selected as the best marriage candidate for their prince. When she refuses, one of them stays to ‘prepare’ her for and perhaps persuade her into marrying their beloved prince! Another Fujiko classic!
