## Sinopse

Maria is a witch living during the Hundred Years' War between England and France. Our young heroine hates war, so to keep the people of the village she protects safe, Maria will use all the power at her disposal to stop the fighting, whether that means conjuring giant dragons or sending her succubus familiar out to mesmerize the warring generals with her charms. But what do the villagers think of her "help"? And what will happen if Heaven notices her interference into human affairs? This story has a funny touch with a little history thrown in.
