## Sinopse

When Hiiragi learns that he has a half-brother he's never met, he decides to meet the man…but is shocked by what he discovers. Hiiragi's newfound older brother is inexplicably covered in bandages from head to toe, and runs a mysterious pet shop that sells rare animals. Behind the counter of this strange place is an even more shocking secret: customers in-the-know can rent out yokai creatures to perform supernatural deeds, as long as they're willing to forge a contract written in blood.
