## Sinopse

By day, Takeo is the president of an up-and-coming IT company. But by night, he's a total otaku! The problem is, for the past 17 years, he's been desperately in love with the self-centered Fumi, a man who happens to hate otakus. But now all of a sudden Fumi is accepting a date with him...?!
