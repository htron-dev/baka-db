## Sinopse

Rei is a president of student council–he is always so cool and well-mannered, impressing everyone with a perfect attendance record. One day, Shindo, a transfer student with outstanding grades, comes to school and starts to have a crush on him. During the semester, Shindo begins making moves on Rei, and really begins to falls in love with him. Shindo is outgoing and sociable. Rei is reserved and a bit snobbish. A perfect scenario of opposites attracts...or do they?
