## Sinopse

Nozomu from sales is always coming to system engineer Teppei with projects that have ridiculous deadlines. No one else will do them but Teppei, and it's because he's always had a secret crush on Nozomu. One day, Teppei decides to blackmail Nozomu into getting intimate with him. What'll happen to the sweet, straight sales guy and the younger alpha male...?
