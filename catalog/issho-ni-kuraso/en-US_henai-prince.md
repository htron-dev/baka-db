## Sinopse

Satou Kouhei, the number one artiste with great acting skills, was obsessed with Takahashi Juunji, a paramedical researcher. Kouhei became the official stalker and appeared everywhere, at the company or even doing household chores at Juunji's house. Regardless of how cold and violent Juunji got, Kouhei accepted it all. Would the sadistic Juunji finally give in to the masochistic Kouhei?
