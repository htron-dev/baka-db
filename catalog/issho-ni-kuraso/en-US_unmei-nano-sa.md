## Sinopse

Our Satou brothers are back! This time, it's the eldest brother, Satou Ryouhei, and Takahashi Jin, the cousin of Takahashi brothers. Jin woke up one morning to find himself being eaten up by a hunk (Ryouhei) who was sleeping beside him. Even though Jin ran away, they met again during the brothers' gathering. Is that a destiny?
