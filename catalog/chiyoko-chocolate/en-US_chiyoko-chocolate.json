    "sinopse": "Chiyoko Kubota used to love hot chocolate. Whenever she had a nightmare, her beloved father would use his chocolatiering magic to create delicious cups of cocoa. However, he vanished one day and never returned; now those blissful days are long gone.\n\nTwenty years later, Chiyoko hates the sickeningly sweet taste of chocolate as it only serves to resurface bad memories. However, after her mother passes away, the store which her father used to run is reopened by a woman who seems to know Chiyoko, and the chocolate she makes is just like that of Chiyoko's father. Could this woman and the bittersweet nostalgia of her chocolates hold the secret of her father's disappearance?\n\nOn the path of self-discovery, Chiyoko learns the importance of moving on from the past, rekindling old passions, and the unbreakable bonds of family.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
