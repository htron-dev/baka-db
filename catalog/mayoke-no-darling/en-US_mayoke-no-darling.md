## Sinopse

At the university's badminton club's freshmen welcome party, everyone is scared stiff when the scary-looking Tougo introduces himself. The fearless (or maybe just clueless) freshmen Haruka ends up sharing a taxi home with Tougo... and while everyone else trembles in fear before him, Haruka finds him handsome.
