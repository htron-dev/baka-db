## Sinopse

Having met during the cherry blossom season, the shy Sakura's reactions which are always fresh and funny captured Umeya's interest. Because of that, he ends up always teasing him. One day, in a drunken moment, Umeya forced a kiss on Sakura. If all he meant to do was just to tease Sakura, then he wondered why does his heart pounds for him...
