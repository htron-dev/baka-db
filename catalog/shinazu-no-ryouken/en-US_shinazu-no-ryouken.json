    "sinopse": "In a world where anyone can just shoot themselves in the head to get rid of a cold, resurrection is what defines being human. Those who can't resurrect themselves, known as Vectors, are diagnosed with Resurrection Deficiency Syndrome (RDS), and are either killed or incarcerated by the police. Some escape artists help these individuals get away from the authorities and give them new identities, but combating immortal foes is not an easy task.\n\nRin is one of these escape artists tasked with saving Vectors whose identities have been compromised. She faces Detective Kenzaki, head of the anti-Vector task force. Kenzaki despises Vectors for causing the death of his little sister, and will stop at nothing to catch them. This is a fight between police and escape artists, between immortals and mortals. The winner is far from certain, but one thing is for sure—it will be bloody!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
