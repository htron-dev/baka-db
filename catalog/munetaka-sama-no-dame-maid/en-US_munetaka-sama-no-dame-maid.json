    "sinopse": "In order to support his poor family, the clumsy Banri began working at the Shishido family's lavish mansion as a maid. But he constantly makes mistakes and ends up crying everyday. With an overwhelming princely and gentle aura that bewitches the women in the estate, the eldest son Munetaka encourages him and makes him feel better. However, after breaking an heirloom plate, their relationship changed completely! The once kind Munetaka demanded, \"spread your legs as an apology,\" with a suggestive expression! Like this, young master Munetaka began innocently teasing Banri. And thus began the days where Banri wanted to shout \"Enough alreadyyyy!!!\"\n\n(Source: J Publishing, translated)",
