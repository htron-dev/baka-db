But the \"Demon Lord\" was defeated by a hero known as the \"Heavenly Knight\", who brought peace to the land.\n\nThis is what is known in the land. But the truth is different.\n\nBecause at the Juvren Knight Academy, the backward student Shun has a \"Heavenly Knight\" father, a \"Demon Lord\" mother, and sisters with dangerous ambitions and superhuman strength.\n\nAs the sisters draw the world into one of slaughter and death, Shun promises, \"I will bring back peace to the family.\"\n\nTo protect what is important, the weak dropout fights to become a hero!",
