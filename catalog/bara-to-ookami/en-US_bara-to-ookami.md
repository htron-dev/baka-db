## Sinopse

Though she's merely an earl's daughter, the king calls Kit to London. What could the king want with a simple country girl like her? She tries to run away but she's caught by her stepfather and beaten. The black-haired knight, Wolf, who has come to take her on the king's orders, is shocked by her bruised face and her muddy clothes. "This filthy uchin is Lady Catherine?" But despite her beaten face and dirty clothes, her eyes and hidden hair are beautiful beyond imagination...
