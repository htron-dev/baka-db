Their paths cross when Woo-jin ruins Da-hong's fruit basket (which she had bought as a gift) by accident, and ends up taking her to her destination in his car as an apology. Unexpectedly, the place Da-hong has been searching for is Woo-jin's own home?! What is their relationship to each other...?\n\n(Source: Springtime Scans)",
