## Sinopse

Three students find out they all share the same name--Hiiro Takumi. They quickly become friends and make up nick-names for one another. One boy will go by Takumi and the other will go by Hiiro. The girl is called Mametaku, meaning “Small Takumi.” A strong bond is formed between the three, but what happens when the two boys both start to have stronger feelings for Mametaku? Who will she choose, and will their friendship survive?! (Source: mangaupdates)
