## Sinopse

A chance incident makes Satake Nagi aware that the anti-social transfer student sitting next to her in class is an actual witch, and one of the rare male ones at that. Being a male witch is not easy, and as Mashiro Uta's magic runs out of control whenever he touches a girl, he has developed a serious allergy towards them. Nagi takes it upon herself, along with fellow occult club member Shuuhei, to work out how to control the errant magic, and possibly cure Mashiro of his phobia.
