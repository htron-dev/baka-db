One day out of the blue, Peter, one of her customers, asked her to pretend to be his girlfriend over the Thanksgiving holiday. He seemed serious and the money would certainly help, so Merry accepted his proposal. When they went to visit his family, his sweet mother welcomed Merry with open arms.

But she was more concerned about how Peter and his son didn't seem to get along. Perhaps there was a way Merry could help Peter and his family...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
