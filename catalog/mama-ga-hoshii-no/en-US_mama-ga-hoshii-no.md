## Sinopse

He was paying her to pretend to love him, but soon his whole family had stolen her heart!

Merry, a server, was in desperate need of money. One day out of the blue, Peter, one of her customers, asked her to pretend to be his girlfriend over the Thanksgiving holiday. He seemed serious and the money would certainly help, so Merry accepted his proposal. When they went to visit his family, his sweet mother welcomed Merry with open arms. She believed that Merry and her son were going to get married. Merry was concerned that Peter's mother was getting too excited about their fake relationship. But she was more concerned about how Peter and his son didn't seem to get along. Perhaps there was a way Merry could help Peter and his family...
