## Sinopse

Iwakuni Natsuko is a slightly odd high school girl who doesn't have many friends because of her strange hobby—going spearfishing on the weekends. One day while hunting near the rocky outcrops, she meets Shounai Akiko, a high schooler who likes camping and cooking.

Catching, cooking and eating, what sort of adventures will these two have?
