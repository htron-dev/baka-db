## Sinopse

Gen, a 32-year-old manager at a shipping company, has no interests, no special skills, no talent, no money, no status, and no virtues. His one and only distinction is his thick body hair. The short gag stories follow his hapless attempts to get ahead in life, only to fall short every time.
