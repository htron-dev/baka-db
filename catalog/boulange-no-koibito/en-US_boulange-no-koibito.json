    "sinopse": "Asao Munenori gave up his dream to become a pâtissier and returned to succeed his parents’ bakery. One day, one of his customers, the pretty Fujikawa Hijiri, fainted right in front of him. They probably already liked each other when they became friends. After a few days without seeing each other, the dense Fujikawa expressed his love honestly without realizing it. After they became lovers, Asao was glad that his hesitation in giving up his dream turned out to be a fruitful one.\n\n(Source: MU)",
