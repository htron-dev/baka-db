## Sinopse

When Ophelia Rosenstein married her husband, the honorable Earl Orpheus Dietrich von Rosenstein, she was in marital bliss. Despite her mediocre appearance and lacking background, she finally understood what it meant to love someone beyond measure—only to have them not love you back.

On as peaceful and sunny a day as any other, Ophelia learns that her beloved Orpheus has someone else that he holds dear in his heart. But his happiness means more to her than anything else; no matter how her heart is torn to pieces, she wants him to be able to wed the woman he loves. So she acts selfish and hateful, the very picture of a terrible wife, all so that he may divorce her easily... yet even so, why won't he let her go?
