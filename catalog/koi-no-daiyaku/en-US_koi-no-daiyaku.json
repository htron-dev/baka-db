    "sinopse": "Based on Penny Jordan's novel \"Rescue Operation.\"\n\nChelsea had been innocent, naive enough to believe her love was so pure it would last forever. But Darren had lied to her, and when she found out he already had a wife, Chelsea turned her back on romance. Now her own niece was about to make the same mistake she had made--with a man infinitely more desirable and sophisticated than Chelsea's first love had been. There was nothing she could do to shield the young girl from anguish. Except, perhaps, to steal the man away herself..\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
