    "sinopse": "Once upon a time, there was a ruler of a small Kingdom who was burdened with the task of running the Kingdom at an early age. This ruler was the ideal monarch who was a natural leader. This ruler's only fault, if you can call it that, was a fetish for women with long straight luscious black hair.\n\nNow imagine that the setting is the present, and that this ruler was a young beautiful Queen.\n\nWelcome to the party, you have just entered the world of Iono-sama Fanatics! Come and lose yourself in a world of dazzling women as a Queen sets out to add gorgeous Japanese women with long straight black hair to her collection of lady escorts! With guns, swords, cars, politics, beauty pageants and exotic women, there's no way you can lose!\n\n(Source: Infinity Studios)",
