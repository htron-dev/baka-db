## Sinopse

Jun Kusakabe and Sayuri Kawamura are female police officers in tight mini skirt uniforms. They fight like men.... No, no, they are even better. Jun will sometimes go a bit too far and gets really wild after a couple of drinks. Soft-spoken and well bred, Sayuri is from a very wealthy family. She cannot stand what is wrong and will do anything to fix it. The pair are like chalk and cheese, but they make ideal partners to solve difficult cases. Sometimes strong and sometimes cute, they can make a difficult case even more difficult. Enter Asami Ikegami, a rival police officer who believes she is more attractive than both Jun and Sayuri, although she has small breasts. Asami compounds the confusion.
