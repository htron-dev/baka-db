## Sinopse

Olympic track star. MIT whiz-kid. Adored by the beautiful co-ed's. Revered by classmates and teammates alike. Yuu was sitting on top of the world. That is, until the evil seductress Payetta, leader of an outlaw gang of boozers and brawlers, kidnaps Yuu at knifepoint and steals him away to her hideout. He learns he's actually the son of Gilgamesh, the legendary founder and ruler of the ancient yet highly advanced civilization of Agarti. The history lesson doesn't stop there, though. Payetta claims to be the granddaughter of Adolf Hitler and wants to share her maniacal dreams with Yuu and the new dystopia she plans to create!
