That is, until the evil seductress Payetta, leader of an outlaw gang of boozers and brawlers, kidnaps Yuu at knifepoint and steals him away to her hideout. He learns he's actually the son of Gilgamesh, the legendary founder and ruler of the ancient yet highly advanced civilization of Agarti. The history lesson doesn't stop there, though.
