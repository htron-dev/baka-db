    "sinopse": "The man who gave me an angel was a cruel billionaire...\n\nElin, the adopted child of a prestigious family, keeps up the façade of a party girl for the tabloids in order to protect her brother. Exhausted by the emptiness of her reality, she gives her virginity to Cortez, an attractive stranger whom she has just met. One year later, after giving birth to a baby, Elin is shocked by her adopted father's deathbed revelation. She must marry within one year or else her inheritance rights will be transferred to another heir—and this newly appeared heir is Cortez!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
