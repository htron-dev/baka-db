## Sinopse

Gokuu is an ordinary private eye for hire. While working on a case involving an illegal weapons dealer, he notices a lot of the detectives working on the case committing suicide for no apparent reason. After Gokuu gets a little too close to the truth, he is then put in a situation where he must stab out his left eye to avoid certain death. Gokuu then awakens in a mysterious lab where an unknown scientist replaces his eye with a cybernetic one that allows him to control every computer in the world.
