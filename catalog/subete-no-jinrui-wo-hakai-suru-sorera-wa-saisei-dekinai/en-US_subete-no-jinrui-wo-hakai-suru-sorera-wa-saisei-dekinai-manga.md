## Sinopse

The year is 1998. Hajime Kanou is a junior high student enthralled with the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering—dubbed "Magic" for short—playing with his classmates every day during breaks. His loud group often catches the attention of Emi Sawatari, the top student who berates Hajime's group for bringing such games to school. Hajime sees Emi as his self-proclaimed rival and challenges her to academic battles, which frequently result in his defeat.

One day, Hajime pays a visit to a card shop that specializes in Magic. Much to his surprise, not only does he find Emi inside, but he also discovers that she is the undisputed best Magic player in the store. This meeting sparks a slow but steady change in their relationship, as they grow to know each other better through various Magic duels. With the turn of the millennium drawing close, the saga of two youth begins.
