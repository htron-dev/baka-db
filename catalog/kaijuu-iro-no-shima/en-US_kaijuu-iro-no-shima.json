She often plays by \"the Hole\", a cave near the sea where a man-eating monster lives, according to folk tales.\n\nOne day, as she meets with another girl who accidentally drops her smartphone in the sea, they fall from a cliff together but miraculously survive. It turns out Furuka is also all alone.\n\n(Source: MU)",
