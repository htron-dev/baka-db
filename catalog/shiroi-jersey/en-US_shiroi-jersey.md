## Sinopse

Nao has fallen in love with her high school homeroom/PE teacher, Aragaki-sensei. He is handsome, kind, and fun. But she dare not tell him. Nao's home life is not good. She hates going home because her mother and sister are always fighting, and everything is a chaotic mess. She would rather be at school, admiring Aragaki-sensei. But when Nao faints one day from the heat and anemia, Aragaki-sensei helps her. Could this be the beginning of a forbidden relationship?
