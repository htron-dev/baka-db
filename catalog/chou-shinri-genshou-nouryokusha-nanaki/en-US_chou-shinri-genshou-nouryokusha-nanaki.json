    "sinopse": "After being hit by a car, strange things begin to happen around Nanaki Shunsuke. He is eventually approached by another young man named Ao, who tells Nanaki that he has been sending Ao his telepathic \"voice,\" and that the accident seems to have awakened some sort of supernatural powers within Nanaki.\n\nThough less than enthusiastic about the idea, Nanaki eventually agrees to join LOCK, The Paranormal Investigations Agency, and partner up with Ao to investigate various cases dealing with the supernatural. However, Nanaki's powers are rather unstable, and Ao seems to have some reason to carry a great mistrust and annoyance for his new partner, making Nanaki's days in his new position a rather trying ordeal. But as they work alongside one another in their pathetically understaffed branch of LOCK, the two find ways they might manage to keep working together, perhaps even without getting the other killed in the process.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Divine: Bokura wa Hikari wo Mita",
