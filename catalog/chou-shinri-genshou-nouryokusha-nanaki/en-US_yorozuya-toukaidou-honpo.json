    "sinopse": "Shima and Kaori are two teenage detectives who have their own odd-jobs agency, Anything Inc. If they take your case, you know your satisfaction will be guaranteed! Shima is a smart kid with a knack for solving other people's problems. He's recently lost his parents to an arson's fire. Now the sight of fire makes him cringe, often reducing the super sleuth into a pool of tears.\n\nKaori, a supermodel, seems an unlikely partner for Shima, but they've been best friends since Kaori hired the junior Sherlock to rid him of a troublesome stalker. For some reason, Shima is comfortable mourning in front of the handsome Kaori; on his end, Kaori trusts Shima to help him suppress his over-aggressive modeling persona, Kyo.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
