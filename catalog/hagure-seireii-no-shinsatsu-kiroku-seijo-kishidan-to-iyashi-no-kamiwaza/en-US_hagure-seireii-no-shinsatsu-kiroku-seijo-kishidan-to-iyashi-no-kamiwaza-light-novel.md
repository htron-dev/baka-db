## Sinopse

Glas loses his path in life when he pulls a "flop" during his spirit summoning ceremony. However, he is given another chance when he receives a royal order to fight in the front lines, along with the Princess's knights, as a war doctor. With his "flop" capable of curing anything, the curtains unfold upon a new fantasy war chronicle!
