It is far from the \"I'm the strongest!\" development and she is forced to get a job at an IT company in that world.\n\nI became a zombie and my colleagues are undead; both their personalities and lifestyles are just weird! Each customer is another familiar monster... Even if I want to die, my next workplace won't let me.\n\n(Source: Hakusensha, translated)",
