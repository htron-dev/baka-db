## Sinopse

Heroine, Hiromi Oka, has just entered a high school famous for its tennis club. She has started playing tennis yearning after Madam Butterfly. She was expecting to enjoy playing tennis with her best friend, Maki, but the situation changes when the new coach, Mr. Munakata, suddenly picks out Hiromi to be one of the players for the upcoming tournament and starts giving Hiromi tough lessons. She strives under any circumstance. The more the new coach gives her training, the better she seems to get. Finally she becomes the representative in the junior match tournament.

Note: This is not a direct sequel to the first series. Due to an overwhelming success of the classic animated series, AIM FOR THE BEST (Ace wo Nerae), this remake was been produced to retrace and flashback to the original series.
