## Sinopse

Eunca is a third year(high school) drama scenario wannabe. Because she takes more time going to movies, its no wonder she cuts school. When she accepts a part time job in Taeruk entertainment (with her friends support), she thought her life would be perfect. Instead, her first day on the job makes her life crazy! She never thought of having a part time job in Min JiEun's as a fiance...it just can't be happening! With only her strong personality, would she survive...and maybe fall in love?
