    "sinopse": "Meet Sarah, successful event planner by day, frustrated 30-year-old virgin by night. Actually, she's not quite 30 yet. The night before the dreaded birthday, she vows to do something about it.\n\nMeet Gang-E, a 29-year-old graphic novelist. She only has one problemâ€”she likes males young, especially her 19 year-old assistant and lover (and adoring fan) Jooyoung. No more boys, she pledges. Gang-E vows to find a real man, even if it kills her.\n\nAnd finally, meet 27-year-old Amber who ruthlessly climbs the corporate ladder, leaving many dead career corpses in her wake. Amber has never met a man she didn't like (and sleep with), nor has Amber ever met a woman she did.\n\nThree lonely women in search of \"happily ever after\" in one modern city filled to the brim with difficult men. We all yearn to drive down a straight, calm road leading us to our happiness. But if it were that easy, life wouldn't be such an amazing ride.\n\n(Source: Netcomics)",
