## Sinopse

Chihiro always wanted to go to college in Tokyo and has finally made the move from his small town. However, a little problem of his has followed him to the big city: he's too sensitive, and a quick-draw in the bedroom. With that in the way, the college life he envisioned is nothing but a pipe dream. Chihiro opens up to his neighbor Kota, to which his new friend responds, "If you just get used to feeling good, you won't be as sensitive to it, right?" Before Chihiro knows what's happening, Kota kisses him and begins "sensitivity training" straight away! Sure, Kota is a more experienced and knowledgeable city boy, but does this normally happen between two guys!? Between a hook like "You wanna be able to do it with a girl, right?" and Kota's training methods, Chihiro can't resist! Sparks begin to fly between a sexy city boy and a straight country bumpkin!
