## Sinopse

Sunohara Momota just recently transferred schools to a quiet part of the country and is settling in. He seems to be fitting in quite nice and already has a couple of friends, a lot of them girls. First there is Natsumiya Sayuri, the class president, who everyone seems to like and then there is Touno Ume, the shy cute girl. He is slowly progressing with each one but can’t really understand which one he likes more. And then there is the girl who he talks to everyday online who he still hasn’t met. Who is Momota going to end up with and what will happen to the girl who doesn’t get what she wants?
