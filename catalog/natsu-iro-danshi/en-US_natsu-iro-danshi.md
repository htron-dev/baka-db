## Sinopse

A new school year is often synonymous with new class and getting to know your peers. It is an opportunity to meet new people & making new friends. And sometimes it doesn't take much to bring two people together, who at first seems to have nothing in common, just like Tomoyuki and Aoi. Nothing seems to predestinate them to be more than just classmates, and yet the simple fact of sharing the same surname seems to make Aoi consider Tomoyuki his future best friend. Even though Tomoyuki is reluctant at first, he is gradually tamed by this exuberant boy. Until the day he realizes a new overwhelming feeling, but it's already too late to go back...
