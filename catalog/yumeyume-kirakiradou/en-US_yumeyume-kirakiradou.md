## Sinopse

Rin is the mysterious shopkeeper of the Yume Kira Dream Shoppe, a magical storefront shop which flies through the sky at dusk. With a store filled with unusual and rare items, Rin listens for wishes that travel on the wind and, aided by an assistant named Alpha, offers magical wares to grant these wishes at the cost of something dear to the customer.
