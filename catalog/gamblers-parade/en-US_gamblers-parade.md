## Sinopse

There is a high school that rests on an island where sly gamblers gather. The unlucky heroine, Shinonome Karin, is met with misfortune on the very first day she transfers to her new school and gets wrapped up in a rigged gamble. At that moment, she is saved by Kumode Nagisa, a teacher with an unsettling air who hates gambling.
