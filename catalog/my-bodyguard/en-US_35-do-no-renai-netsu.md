## Sinopse

Honda is a pharmacist who is overworked due to the hospitalization of his co-worker (who he's secretly in love with). Luckily, one of his customers, Sasashi, turns out to be a doctor who is looking for a job. Honda immediately hires him, but then learns that not only was he fired from his previous job for embezzeling, but he's a notorious playboy too.
