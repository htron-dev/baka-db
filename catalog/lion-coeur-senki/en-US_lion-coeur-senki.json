    "sinopse": "Tanaka was a salary-man who lived an average life. That life came to an end when he was 41 years old... or it was supposed to. But when he came to, he was standing in a world that resembled Medieval Europe. There was no heating, and food was eaten with your hands. On top of all that, pigs run wild in the city... And in this harsh world, Tanaka would live his second life as \"Balian De Lioncourt\". Will this average salary-man be able to survive?\n\n(Source: Takeshobo, translated)",
