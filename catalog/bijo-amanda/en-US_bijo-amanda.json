    "sinopse": "The high school columnist looking for the next big story gets more than she bargained for when she digs into the wife of a man she meets. The female anime characters that the class nerd draws become real and over protective of their creator. The monster behind the old child’s story haunts the people that break the rules of the contract. These are some of the episodes in this collection of short horror stories.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)\n\n1. Bijo Amanda\n2. Gajo\n3. Sacrifice\n4. Jigoku no Teruteru Bouzu\n5. Kyuushoku no Iida-san",
