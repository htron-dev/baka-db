## Sinopse

Meet Jin Kikuchihara, a popular 3rd-year dormitory student at a Boys' School and the President of their Movie Club. In the school, Kikuchihara is practically a god. No one can resist his immaculate eyebrows, perfect grades, physical fitness, and confident personality... except his rival Giichi Ichikawa, a lanky 2nd year student and fudanshi. Ichikawa's overwhelming passion for directing and devotion to quality have made him into the rising star of the Movie Club, threatening Kikuchihara's supremacy of the club. But when these two rivals with their similar interests are forced to share a room, sparks are bound to fly!
