    "sinopse": "Mao Tsuchiya is roommates with Hisashi Otomo, who is secretly gay. That's why they made 3 rules:\n\n1. Mao must never reveal Hisashi's secret\n2. Hisashi won't look at Mao as a romantic interest\n3. Neither of them can get in the way of the other's \"personal needs\"\n\nThey had no problems living together until the movie club—which Mao is part of—decided to do a BL movie for their school festival project and cast Hisashi for the lead role.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
