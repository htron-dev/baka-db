    "sinopse": "Daily bullying has turned Kei's life into a living hell, but no one seems to pay any heed to his suffering, save for his childhood friend, Akira. Deciding he prefers death over having to endure the constant harassment, Kei decides to commit suicide, and Akira offers to join him. However, things don't exactly go according to plan—Kei survives, but Akira is never seen again. A year later, the bullying has only intensified once the video of their attempted suicide is found circulating online.\n\nLooking up the video leads Kei to Over Bleed, a website dedicated to underground street fighting. As fate would have it, the rising star of the website, Bunen, shares an odd resemblance to Akira. Out of desperation, Kei decides to participate in the world of street fighting in the hopes of a reunion. But the road to Akira is riddled with strong opponents that will test the limits of Kei's strength and resolve.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
