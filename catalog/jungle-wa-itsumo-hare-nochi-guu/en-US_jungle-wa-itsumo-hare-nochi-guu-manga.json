    "sinopse": "The story is about Haré, a 10-year-old boy who lives with his mother Weda in a small village in a very strange jungle. Haré's mom is a bit of a \"party girl\" and likes to sleep in all day and party with her girl friends all night. Things change one evening when Weda comes home with a little \"playmate\" for Haré, a pretty little girl named Guu. But when Haré wakes up the next morning, Guu has \"transformed\" into a sullen, nasty and sarcastic joker who takes great pleasure in making Haré's life utterly miserable. Guu can also swallow anything, and regurgitate it whole. Guu also seems to have various magic powers, which lead Haré to consider her a demon of some sort, but he can't convince most other people of that.",
