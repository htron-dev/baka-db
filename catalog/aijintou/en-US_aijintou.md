## Sinopse

Ashley lives on a small island off the coast of Florida that her late father left to her. One weekend, a mysterious man named Sebastian comes to the island. Unable to resist this rough, charismatic man, Ashley spends many nights with him... Soon after he leaves the island, she learns that a large corporation has taken the island as payment for her debt. The president of that company is none other than Sebastian himself. Ashley goes to confront him and beg for her island back. He consents... but only if she becomes his lover for a month!
