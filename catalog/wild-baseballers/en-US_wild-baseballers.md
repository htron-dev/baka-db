## Sinopse

A rural Hokkaido school of delinquents is all up in arms with the rumored arrival of an infamous 'monster' from Sapporo. First-year trio delinquents meet the new student and fellow classmate, Aoki Issei, and learn that besides his crazy strength and wild violence, he's got a passion for baseball.

When Issei's 'guardian' arrives, they find out she's even crazier and more dangerous than him. Somehow the entire school get caught up in her determination to resuscitate the baseball club and make it to Koshien.
