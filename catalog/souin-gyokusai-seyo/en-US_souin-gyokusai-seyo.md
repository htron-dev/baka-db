## Sinopse

Souin Gyokusai seyo! is a "semi-autobiographical account of the desperate final weeks of a Japanese infantry unit at the end of World War II." Mizuki drew from his own experiences as a soldier in that war to depict the horrors of battle.

On an island at the end of 1943, Japanese soldiers are obliged to commit suicide in order to save the honor of their country.
