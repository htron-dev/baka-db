## Sinopse

Why is Jack Tarkenton here? Meg doubts her eyes. Why would he turn up at her husband's funeral of all places? Jack, the son of an affluent family that rivals the Kennedy's, spent a passionate night with Meg 5 years ago. From this union, their daughter, Katie, was born. Jack does not know about Katie, and Meg does not intend to tell him. However, now that he's approached Meg, this exceptionally wealthy and handsome man intimidates and overpowers her. Even though she never wants anything to do with him ever again!
