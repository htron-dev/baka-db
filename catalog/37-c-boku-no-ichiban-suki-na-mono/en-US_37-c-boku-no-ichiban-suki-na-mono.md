## Sinopse

Guitarist Kai's father passed away when Kai was young, leaving his mother and younger brother as his only family until recently when his mother remarried. Now, Kai and his brother have been living with their stepfather and new stepsister, Miyu, for about a year. It's the kind of happiness Kai had always wanted for his family ever since he was a child and he certainly cannot rock the boat. That's why it is absolutely imperative that no one find out he is in love with Miyuu. Still, he can't help but express the pain of a love that will never be in his compositions...
