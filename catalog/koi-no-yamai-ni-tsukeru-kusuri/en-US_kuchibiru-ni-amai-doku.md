## Sinopse

Jin and Yuu are pop singers in the duo CROSS. They've always been friends, but lately things have become different. Yuu is determined to seduce Jin so they can always be together, but he's an idiot, so it's not going well. But whenever Yuu starts acting like over eager puppy, Jin can't seem to resist him.
