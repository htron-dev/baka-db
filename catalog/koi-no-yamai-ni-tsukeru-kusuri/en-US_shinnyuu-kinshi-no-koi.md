## Sinopse

Popular actor Kenzaki Shinya had a one-night stand with a youth who happened to be the agency’s newbie, Mizutani Sachi. Not only did Sachi become Kenzaki’s assistant, he’s also a big fan of Kenzaki. Though he despised Sachi accepting everyone’s invitation in bed, Kenzaki simply couldn’t take his eyes off Sachi—…Was it their destiny to love each other?
