But as fate would have it, the two are mistakenly left on a deserted island during an imoprtant research expidition. Yuichi would prefer to drown Imakura in the sea with his bare hands rather than listen to his contstant complaining. But as the days fade into weeks, Yuichi finds himself craving Imakura's company more than civilization itself.\n\nWill the two find a forbidden love in this tropical paradise? Or will Yuichi and Imakura live out their lives stranded on a deserted island with the one person in the world the can't stand?\n\nOriginally published as a short, Don't Worry Mama returns as a full-length novel with an all new bonus story, \"Present.\"\n\n\\*taken from back of novel",
