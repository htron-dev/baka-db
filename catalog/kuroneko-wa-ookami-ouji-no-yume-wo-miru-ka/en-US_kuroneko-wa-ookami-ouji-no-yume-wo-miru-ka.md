## Sinopse

In a world divided into dogs (dominants) and cats (submissives), Aoi Natsuyama was one of the most common cat types: a house cat. All he wanted in life was to find the prince of his dreams. The prince he's fallen in love with is a handsome wolf, Yukio, who he's seen in naughty videos. Aoi decides to get a job in the industry to meet him, but it turns out Yukio isn't charming or kind at all!!

A cute, Cinderella love story between a dual-natured wolf and a dreamy-yet-kind-of-pushy cat!
