    "sinopse": "My first impression of him was the worst. Nariyuki Kishibe is my uncle's close friend and my aunt's childhood friend. All he does is joke around and say inappropriate things. Mamoru, who stayed at his uncle's house when he went to college, is sick of Nariyuki's persistent teasing every time they meet. However, during times when he shows his cool and adult side, Mamoru's heart also flutters. One day, when Mamoru stayed over at Nariyuki's house, both of of them shared a passionate desire on the bed?! Nariyuki, who woke up from his sleep, kissed Mamoru and then did XXX?!\n\n(Source: Taiyo Tosho, translated)",
