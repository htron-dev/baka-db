## Sinopse

This series is about three of Japan's most famous historical figures...when they were teenagers. Oda Nobunaga will one day be known as the "Demon King," and go on to become the first of the "Three Great Unifiers." But in 1548, he's still the carefree heir of the Owari Province. His companions are Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and the young child-hostage Tokugawa Ieyasu. Meanwhile, Japan is steeped in war and intrigue. Mr. Zipangu is a fresh and humourous retelling of Nobunaga's life: read and see!
