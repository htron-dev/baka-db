## Sinopse

A puppet stop motion animation adapted from a Chinese folk tale about a witty goat who hides in a cave from a tiger. The goat lies to the tiger that it is the king of the mountain and eats tigers, scaring the tiger off. The tiger meets a fox at the bottom of the mountain and tells the fox what happened. The fox laughs and says that the tiger had been tricked by a goat.
