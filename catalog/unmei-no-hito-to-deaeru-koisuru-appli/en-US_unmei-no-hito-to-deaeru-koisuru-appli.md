## Sinopse

One day at school, a friend shows Hiroto Kyouno a new app called "Meet Your Soulmate." However, Kyouno is indifferent to love and doesn't believe in fortune-telling apps...until Kyouno meets a guy on the train who looks exactly like how the app described his soulmate! Could this guy really be his soulmate? How can Kyouno close the distance between them so they can become friends? And then something more?
