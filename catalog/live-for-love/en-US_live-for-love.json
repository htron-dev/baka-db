    "sinopse": "Yasuie runs the Kiryuuin Detective Agency in Tokyo's Shinjuku Nichome neighborhood. With no clients and no money, it's a constant struggle just to live and pay the rent. For the past seven years, Yasuie's assistant and partner Yoshiyuki has been willing to suffer throught all the good and bad times with him--even considering Yasuie's playful advances, which approach sexual harassment--but life has a way of changing things. Faced with his family's ultimatum, Yoshiyuki must choose between a penniless future with Yasuie and a more traditional lifestyle. Can Yasuie convince Yoshiyuki to stay with him? Even if Yasuie does confess the true reason he brought Yoshiyuki into the detective business, will it be enough to change his partner's mind? (June cover)",
