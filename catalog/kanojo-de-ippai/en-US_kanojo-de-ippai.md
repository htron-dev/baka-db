## Sinopse

Akira Toudou is eager to put his past behind him and start his new life in a new apartment. With key in hand, he discovers that his new bachelor pad has been double-booked and like it or not, he’s going to have to take on a roommate. Not just any roommate though, but busty, free-spirited, adult manga artist Hina Kamiyama. Akira is going to have his hands more than full fending off his nosy boss and Hina’s entourage of randy artist friends as he tries to get his life back on track.
