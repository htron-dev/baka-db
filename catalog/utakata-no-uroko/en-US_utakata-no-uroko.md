## Sinopse

Singer-songwriter Tetsuta, became unable to sing because of throat surgery a step before his major debut. After turning down his friend who asked him to compose a song, he goes to the sea and meets Nagi, a young man who runs a restaurant with his father. This mysterious youth invites Tetsuta to their restaurant and listens to his troubles, which ended with him staying the night. Tetsuta hears Nagi's singing voice and receives an electrifying impact from within his body. For the first time in his life, he wants someone else to sing the songs he composed.
