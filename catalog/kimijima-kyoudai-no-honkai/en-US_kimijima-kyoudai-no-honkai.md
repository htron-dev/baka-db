## Sinopse

Hikaru Kimijima is the school's popular and intelligent student council president. He is often seen in the presence of various women, but he also has many male admirers—and his younger brother Takumi carefully learns the faces of each of his older brother's lovers. When Hikaru inevitably cuts the women loose, they turn to Takumi for help, and he agrees to convey their messages to his brother only if they will have sex with him first.

Truthfully, Takumi is not interested in any of his brother's former girlfriends, and his actions are not meant to hurt Hikaru in any way. His motive for sleeping with these women actually comes from a desire to vicariously become more intimate with Hikaru. As close as the two already are, what Takumi craves most is to dominate his brother and make a mess of him. Is it possible that Hikaru would ever reciprocate Takumi's most secret, forbidden feelings?
