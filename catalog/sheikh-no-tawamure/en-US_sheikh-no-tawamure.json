    "sinopse": "Lured by a sweetly beautiful piano melody, Prince Shahir meets a beautiful lady. But, once the figure at the piano notices him, she runs out as if trying to escape from him... \"Just who was that woman in my castle?\" He finds the answer soon. Her name is Kirsten, and she is one of the castle custodians. He is the crown prince of a kingdom, and has no intention of something as foolish as laying a hand on an employee. However, he can't believe a woman so beautiful is a custodian... Could there be some sort of reason? And the prince playfully gets close to Kirsten?!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
