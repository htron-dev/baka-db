Even though she ought to have been able to fall in love with someone else at least once, she ends up realizing that the curse of Hoshina, who hurt and controlled her, was stronger than those feelings. At the same time as Kyodoko once more gets mired in the maze that is Hoshina of her own will, he has a relationship with her kouhai and even manipulates her work as he likes?
