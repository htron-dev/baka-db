    "sinopse": "The protagonist of the story is Joji Kano, a detective employed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's special crimes division, which handles serious criminal cases. His gun of choice is a customized .44 Magnum-caliber Ruger Blackhawk. Even though Kano and his co-workers are criticized by the media and society, he doesn't mind the criticism at all. Even though Kano has no pity for serious criminals, he holds a gentle respect for children and elderly people, as well as former criminals who want to redeem themselves from their past behavior.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
