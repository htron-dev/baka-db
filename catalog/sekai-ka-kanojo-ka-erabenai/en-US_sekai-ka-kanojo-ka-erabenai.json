    "sinopse": "Kouki Nakagawa is in love with Ayumi Fujisaki, his childhood friend, who lost her parents at a young age. Unable to convey her feelings after this traumatic event, Ayumi's emotional instability developed a chaotic side effect—the ability to cause natural disasters. Unaware of her condition, the lovestruck Kouki decides to ask Ayumi out. But the sudden appearance of Hikari Jindou thwarts his plans as she declares that the world will end if he confesses to Ayumi!\n\nMatters become more complicated after Hikari offers a bold solution to Kouki—if he picks her over Ayumi, he will get to experience all kinds of erotic acts that he can only dream of. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, who will Kouki end up choosing?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
