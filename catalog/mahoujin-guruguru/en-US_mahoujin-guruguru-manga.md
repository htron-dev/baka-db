## Sinopse

Mahoujin Guruguru is a light-hearted show aimed at older children, although it contains occasional toilet gags and some innuendo that might startle western parents. It is a parody of early role playing games, particularly turn based games such as the Final Fantasy series. The narrator speaks in place of the dialog in such games and this is one of the comedy elements of the show. Often RPG-style information boxes are displayed on screen along with accompanying narration in the traditional RPG style. The overall goal of the main characters, Nike and Kukuri, is to defeat Giri, the ruler of the darkness.
