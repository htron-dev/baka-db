    "sinopse": "Enter Shizukuishi, a pants-wetting girl that literally fell into the lap of a boy named Kouki while he was visiting a robot maid exposition with his love interest and apparently his sister as well, Kaoruko. Things start rolling the wrong direction after Kouki ends up licking Shizukuishi's urine (don't ask)! A thread of light appears from a mark on Kouki's right hand and connects to Shizukuishi. Kouki is seemingly able to control Shizukuishi's actions through the thread. But wait, Shizukuishi has a seal for an ancient destructive giant within her womb that causes her to become \"strange\" at times. Oh yeah, and nobody can have sex with Shizukuishi, or else the seal on the giant within her will be broken.\n\nThus begins the strange story and juicy love comedy that is Iinari! Aibration.",
