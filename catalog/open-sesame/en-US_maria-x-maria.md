## Sinopse

Legend has it that males in the Seryou household are bound to be luckless when it comes to women. Masaki Seryou, a 15-year-old high school student, is a testament to this. As he hopes to leave his nagging female-dominated family behind and moves to the dorms, he falls into an even more baffling situation involving the same thing he's attempted to escape—women.
