Her biggest mistake is to accept the charming words of a French trader who offers her a free ride in a yacht in return for her services as a crew member. This man turns out to be a drug dealer, and after being exposed by the sheikh, the trader offers Emily as a gift! The sheikh thinks she is a prostitute, and her attempts to convince him otherwise fall on deaf ears. And now, she finds herself held captive in the luxurious palace...! (Mangafox)",
