    "sinopse": "Tamaki Otoya is the last in a line of ancient summoners tasked to battle evil forces that threaten mankind. Burdened by his duty as a summoner, Tamaki has always found strength from his childhood friend Asahi, with whom he has a deep emotional bond. So when Asahi's friend is found out to be possessed by a demon, he awakens--as the one destined to exorcise demons out of tortured human souls.\n\nFruits Basket creator Natsuki Takaya delivers a story of love, loss, and the redemptive power of forgiveness, in this heartbreaking tale of star-crossed lovers who are bound by a responsibility that may destroy them.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
