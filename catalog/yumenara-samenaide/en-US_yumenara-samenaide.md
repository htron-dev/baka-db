## Sinopse

Sachika encountered a traffic accident and was in a coma, but awoke from it. It was not her parents or her lover Tetsuo that awaited her, but it was a man who she didn't know. He introduced himself as Kohara and one of her distant relatives, and took her to his house. Gradually she felt that something was wrong, and got aware of a shocking fact. Besides the title story, two additional stories are collected.
