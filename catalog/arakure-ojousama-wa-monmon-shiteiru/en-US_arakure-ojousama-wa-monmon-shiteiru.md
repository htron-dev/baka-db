## Sinopse

Meet Tsubaki Kuchinashi, the Manhater Prince. Beautiful and popular, Tsubaki's core strength in high school comes from her position as the principal's granddaughter—suffice it to say, but any student or teacher who even looks at her the wrong way could be expelled at a moment's notice. And Tadashi Kiritsu, the head of the Public Morals Committee. As sharp and rigid as his glasses, Tadashi despises Kuchinashi's iron grip on the school.

Naturally, a challenge to her rule bothers Kuchinashi, and she decides to get rid of Kiritsu as soon as possible. Her plan? Get him in a honey trap. However, that's easier said than done.
