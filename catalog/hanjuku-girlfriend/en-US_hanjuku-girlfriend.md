## Sinopse

Favourite thing: eating. Least favourite thing: "ikemen." Aoka starts to be intrigued by her classmate Usuta-kun, who has next to no presence. He is an unfortunate "hidden ikemen," and only Aoka knows this. Aoka decides to help him so that he can confess his feelings to a girl he has an unrequited love for.
