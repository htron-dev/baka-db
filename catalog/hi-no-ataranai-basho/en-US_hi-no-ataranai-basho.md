## Sinopse

Hiroya has a severe allergy of the sun and he has hidden feelings towards his classmate, Takuto. It has been 15 years since he last left the island and his dark past. He was able to start a Town Renewal Business together with his gay friends. One day, a sudden call came to the company with someone’s voice he could never forget. He was Takuto—his first love.
