## Sinopse

Karin is an average girl...at best. She's not good at sports and gets terrible grades. Plus, her parents are dead and her beloved cat Shii-chan just died, too. She is miserable...but everything is about to change. Because little does Karin know that her mother's ring has the power to make her a goddess! Soon she and Kazune, a brusque but cute boy with godlike powers of his own, will have to fight to protect Karin's ring and Kazune's cousin Himeka from the evil forces of Kirio Karasuma...who has divine designs of his own.
