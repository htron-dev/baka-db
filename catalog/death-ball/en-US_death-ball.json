    "sinopse": "This may seem just like baseball, but when you can switch out the bats for weapons and the balls for bullets, is it even still just a \"game\"? When idol Yuki Tengoku accidentally throws an unbelievable pitch, she gets invited to play for the lowest-ranked Death Ball, team Dangerous. But when she's dropped right into a game where nothing is off-limits, everyone has superpowers and special moves, and any wrong move could lose her uniform – is her uncontrollable hard fastball \"Titanic\" enough to keep her afloat?\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
