    "sinopse": "Like the other 1990s Kitaro mini-movies, this is a remake of a story that’s already been done in the anime, but like every Kitaro remake this is a very different take on the story. In this case it’s a remake of the baseball story that was featured in the very first episode of the original series from 1968.\n\n(Source: TSHS)",
