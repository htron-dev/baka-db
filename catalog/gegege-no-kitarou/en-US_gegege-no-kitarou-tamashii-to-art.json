    "sinopse": "A Gegege no Kitarou VR/3D film by Toei Animation in collaboration with Dynamo Pictures (Dynapix) in honor of Toei's 50th anniversary with the franchise. In the first film you end up in the youkai world due to okuribi, giant bonfires that signify when the spirits return to the spirit world at the end of Obon. In the second film you the viewer gets lost in the youkai world and try to find your way home guided by Medama Oyaji.\n\nThe films were viewable at various expos and film festivals. For March 2019 they will have a wider release at theaters that support VR technology (eg. the Lina World amusement park in Yamagata).\n\nThe films are said to be compatible with the Lenovo Mirage Solo with Daydream standalone VR headset and will be accessible/rentable to those with such devices sometimes in autumn 2019.",
