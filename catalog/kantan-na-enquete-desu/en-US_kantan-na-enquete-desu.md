## Sinopse

At a certain university, a make up class is being held to give students all the remaining credits they need. Their task is simple: watch 24 short films and rank them in order of preference via a survey. Beginning with a tale where computer viruses have cute avatars—charming their users as they carry out malicious activities—the tone, genre, and diversity of the films continuously grows more and more bizarre. Bewildered, a group of students begins to discuss the films after class, unwittingly leading them into situations as outlandish as the ones they just viewed.
