## Sinopse

"Nekomura-san" shares the story of Nekomura, Japan's most famous housekeeper! With the appearance of a cat, Nekomura is being employed by an upper-class family. She notices everything that goes on in the house and she does not fail to intrigue! She is very hard-working, but she can't help but poke her nose here and there occasionally, and stumbling upon some secrets. An unusual manga that has great humor and shows the trials of the Japanese that are not very much different than ours.
