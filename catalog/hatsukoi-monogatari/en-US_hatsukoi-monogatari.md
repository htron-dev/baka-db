## Sinopse

Aratsuka Kaoru, a math sensei teaching in an all boys’ middle and high school boarding school, is also known as “Alaska” because of his coldness. He has never been in love before because he’s afraid to share his feelings with another. After some issues, he spent a night in the room of the infirmary sensei, Suzuki Kouta. It was the first time someone touched him. What will happen there after?
