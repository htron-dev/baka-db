## Sinopse

Welcome to "Ina-tei," a small restaurant staffed by a cute little girl and the ever so reliable mistress of the house. The secret behind the delicious menu at this restaurant lies in the kitchen staff: a wide array of unique demons, ranging from the "Kappa" to a talking fireball. To top it off, the mascot of the store is a little cat-like creature that controls thunder and lightning.

Including Touya, the young hope from the "Youkai Aratamegata" (government sanctioned demon hunters) watch as the staff of "Inatei" go about their daily lives capturing demons and feeding the growing population of the Edo community.
