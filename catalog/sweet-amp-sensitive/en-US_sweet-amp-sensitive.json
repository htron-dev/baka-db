    "sinopse": "Ee-Ji is a high school freshman with one best friend, three older brothers... and absolutely no interest in boys. That is, until she notices one of her classmates, Han-Kyul, for the first time, and figures out she knew him from school when they were kids. Now that she thinks about it, she liked him before and she starts to realize she likes him now. She finds it hard to deal with her feelings, especially when another classmate, Sae-Run, is always bugging her. Ee-Ji can't seem to figure out how to express herself, being so shy, sweet, and sensitive.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
