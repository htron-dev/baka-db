## Sinopse

Mutsuki Haruna, who works for an alcohol distribution company, is assigned the challenging task of getting a contract from a sake producer who is everyone's nightmare: Wakatake Brewery. Mutsuki reluctantly goes there expecting to meet the intimidating master brewer; however, he ends up running into the owner's handsome but distinctly unfriendly grandson, Shuusaku Nakagawa, and falls for him at first sight. Though this fateful encounter leaves both the young man and his grandfather displeased, the undaunted Mutsuki continues to pursue both the elusive contract as well as Shuusaku's icy cold heart.
