## Sinopse

Marimo and Rin are very young sisters. Who are the two continuing to fight and what are they escaping from? That secret happened several years earlier, and its origin was an explosion at a certain factory. A mysterious virus hit a district, and the two have obtained strange powers: the power to wound and kill a person with just a touch and the power to calm a person's heart by touching. Hand in hand, the sisters continue their escape in order to fulfill their promise to their mother, going towards a certain place, however...

A forbidden escape suspense!
