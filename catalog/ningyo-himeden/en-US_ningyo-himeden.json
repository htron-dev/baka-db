Crazed with vengeance for human atrocities against their mother, these mermaid sisters have sworn to kill...but things take a twist when Julie falls for the all-too-human Suekichi, and the two lovers find themselves in the middle of an inter-special feud. Will Julie find true love? Or will the double-dealings of the lusty Dragon of the deep take things in a whole other direction?\n\n(Source: Viz)",
