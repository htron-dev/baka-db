The childhood friend and now incredibly cute school girl has always attracted spirits and, even though she can't see them, she unknowingly exorcises them. Taliho never believed Nanase about the spirits until one night, she breaks the seal holding in a spirit inside their campus. Not a harmful spirit, Amagi Ako, a former student who died years ago but was trapped inside their campus, makes friends with Nanase and Taliho. Ako mistakes Nanase for his dad and they soon realize his parents have something to do with Ako's spirit being imprisoned.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
