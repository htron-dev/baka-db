## Sinopse

A collection of short, romantic stories. The first is about the unlikely romance between a rich, elegant young girl and a scruffy, rough, not-so-rich guy. The story that fills the largest portion of this volume is set in the roaring 20's, and is about the romance between a boxer and a flapper girl. The mob is involved. Lots of drama and excitement!
