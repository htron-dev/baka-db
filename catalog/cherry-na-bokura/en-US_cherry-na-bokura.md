## Sinopse

A 17-year-old girl, who has no experience with guys, one day sees a classmate drop something and without realizing what it is, she returns it to the guy. But soon she finds out that what she picked up was actually a condom! After school, she coincidentally meets the guy in the hallway and she's excited to be so close to a guy for the first time! But when she sees him flirting with other girls, she realizes that he's just a player...? What will happen between them?!
