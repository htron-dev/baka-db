## Sinopse

The manga centers on three first-year players from Shingen Prefectural High School's baseball team, the most average high school baseball team in Japan, with no medals and no outstanding losses to speak of. The trio consists of the cheerful Oomori, the foodie Akimoto, and the straight-arrow Miyata, as they try to balance their studies and sports.
