## Sinopse

The afterlife! Once someone goes in they can never make it out alive! Snow White journeyed to the spirit world with the pass to the spirit world her mom left her to find her dad’s spirit but…

“To lose my love, or to kill her, those are the two choices I’m faced with.”
The blood loving and cold, absolute devil, Pa Sun.

The one who wishes to protect Snow White’s happiness but must take her life, Tae San.
"I no longer have the right to be by your side, I love you.
Holding those feelings in my heart, I leave you for your sake."

Will our kind and lovely Snow White’s jealous sister Oori’s curse follow her to the afterlife…?
