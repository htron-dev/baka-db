## Sinopse

It’s the year 2007, and Masaya’s out in the woods with his friends when they bump into a mysterious boy(?) named Yuuki. His brains and brawn are both unparalleled, but he’s pretty innocent in the ways of the world. Masaya’s heart keeps beating faster whenever their paths cross… enjoy the sweeping, futuristic romance of Sleeping Next To You, but don’t miss out on the other three exciting romances collected in this volume!
