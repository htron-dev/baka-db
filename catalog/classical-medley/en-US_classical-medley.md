## Sinopse

In the kingdom of Classical, an ancient evil is unleashed! A ceremony held once every 100 years has kept the entity imprisoned inside of a mystical orb. But when the evil force escapes, it takes possession of the King and Queen. They try to overpower Prince Soprano, but his guardian knight Alto and his pet moondragon Mezzo help him to get away. Soon, the three of them are on the run and branded as outlaws. Alto carries the force used to entrap the evil entity, but will he be able to use it to help them bring harmony back to Classical?
