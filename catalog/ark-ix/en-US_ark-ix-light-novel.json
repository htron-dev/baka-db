    "sinopse": "The series is set 150 years after humanity lost half of the planet due to a mysterious \"black fog.\" To contain the \"black fog,\" 3,000-meter-tall (about 10,000-feel-tall) walls were erected to split the world, and the half of the human population that survived now live in cities called \"Arks.\"\n\nShidou Enishi, one of the few Japanese survivors, runs a detective agency on the ninth ark. While pursuing a male suspect in a burglary, he learns of a massive conspiracy, one that may be tied to the Rivigarudo syndrome that is mutating its victims into something inhuman.",
