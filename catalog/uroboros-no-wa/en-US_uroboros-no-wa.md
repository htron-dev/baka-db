## Sinopse

"The moment you open the letter, you will be cursed. After reading the letter, you have to make two copies and send it to a close friend within 24 hours."

Everyone knows what it's like to pass notes in class. People carelessly write about things like love or gossip. One day, everything suddenly turns out evil...
