One day, his sister Ryoko sends Mayu and Mikihiro Tsukimura, two siblings, to live with him to help Mayu overcome her problem. Mayu's problem: androphobia (fear of men), and Ryoko wants Shungo to help her overcome it. How? By making Mayu and Shungo share the same room, bed, and even take baths together.
