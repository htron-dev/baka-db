## Sinopse

Icons are pieces of art or paintings that contain complex iconography by hiding unique meanings in its backgrounds or objects. Chikage, a girl who studied iconography in England, learns that her grandfather passed away and returns to her homeland Japan. At the gallery currently run by her grandmother, she is asked to judge a pair of paintings. Apparently those paintings were stolen pieces and come with a dark history...?!
