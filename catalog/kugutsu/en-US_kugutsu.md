## Sinopse

“Find the doll maker, and take the puppet!" That was the cryptic message that was sent to Nimiya when her grandfather passed away. Yet the mission is not as straightforward as it seems. Just who is behind the Shikigami insurgence, and what are they after? And will Nimiya and the electrician be able to stop them before it's too late?
