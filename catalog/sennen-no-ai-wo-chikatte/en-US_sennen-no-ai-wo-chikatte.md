## Sinopse

At first, Evie was perfectly comfortable being just Raschid's lover even when everyone was against it. But the day was coming when he must take an appropriate bride. Evie knew their relationship couldn't last, but then came another problem—she was pregnant. Evie knew her dream of having a life together with Raschid was impossible, but she was still hopeful. When she told him the news, he wasn't as happy as she thought he'd be. He felt as if he had no choice but to get married because of the baby. That wasn't the kind of life Evie wanted. With her pregnancy, nothing but difficulties came her way. Can Evie still get her happy ending somehow?
