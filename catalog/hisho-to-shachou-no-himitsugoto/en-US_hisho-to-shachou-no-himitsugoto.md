## Sinopse

The story between an elite president company and his loyal secretary.

Takemiya is working as a secretary for the Young President, Iwase. Iwase is an amazing guy who has a huge gap. Compared to his gorgeous looks and capabilities, he's an airhead and his honest side is totally cute! The younger dog, Takemiya, is madly in love with that President and always gets led around by him, but…?! The dog suddenly returns the favor clumsily saying, "President, I want to hold you?!"
