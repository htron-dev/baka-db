## Sinopse

Kyouko is a 26-year-old daycare employee. While everyone around her is getting married, she spends her days lamenting over her lack of a love life.

One day, Kyouko impulsively decides to take part in a mixer after being invited by a colleague. There, she meets Yuusuke, a self-proclaimed unmotivated government employee. As he tends to a drunk Kyouko, she believes him to be kind, but then his personality suddenly changes...?!
