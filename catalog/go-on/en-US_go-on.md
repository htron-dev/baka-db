## Sinopse

Ryou Katase is a high school student who has always been treated as an errand boy by his juniors on the baseball club. He has always been an unpopular guy and people even often mistakenly call his name. His life however is forever changed when Nagano, a female classmate who happens to be his high school crush, lends him Weezer's first album and when he meets Yomogida, a wild, insane, and unpredictable guy who asks him to form a band.
