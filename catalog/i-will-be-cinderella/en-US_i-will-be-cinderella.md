## Sinopse

My father died when I was small, and my mother was a first-ranked maid, who left me in the charge of my grandparents. The last time I met her was when she was 36.
Out of curiosity, I plunge into the world of maids. I wait on young master Rain, and study at the school for maids. And master Rain's brother.... he is.... what's my feeling for him anyway? Could it be love?

And just you wait, I will be Cinderella.
