The last time I met her was when she was 36.\nOut of curiosity, I plunge into the world of maids. I wait on young master Rain, and study at the school for maids. And master Rain's brother.... he is.... what's my feeling for him anyway? Could it be love?\n\nAnd just you wait, I will be Cinderella.\n\n(Source: Loyal Kiss)",
