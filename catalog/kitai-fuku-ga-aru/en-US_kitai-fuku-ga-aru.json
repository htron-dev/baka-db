    "sinopse": "Mami is a college student with a secret that she can't tell anyone: she's really into Lolita fashion. Since she's tall and looks cool at a glance, her family and friends expect that image from her, and she's scared to stray away from that image. However, after seeing Ozawa, a coworker at her part-time job who doesn't care about what other people think of his eccentric fashion, she gradually opens up her true self to the world.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
