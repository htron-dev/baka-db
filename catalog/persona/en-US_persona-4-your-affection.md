## Sinopse

It consists primarily of short stories touching on the themes of day-to-day life of the main cast of the games. Topics covered are Yousuke Hanamura not quite being used to living in the countryside yet, the fact that good friends like Yukiko Amagi and Chie Satonaka can still be awkward in some respects with each other, and Nanako Dojima worrying over her busy father.
