## Sinopse

The story focuses on the 16-year-old protagonist, Akira Kurusu, who got transferred to Shujin High School in Tokyo after he was sued by a man with political connection for a non-existent violence when Akira saved a woman from being molested by the man, leading to his probation. Arriving in Tokyo, he finds a mysterious app got installed into his phone that enables him to enter another world formed from corrupt hearts of adults where he awakens his power called Persona. During his times there, he is joined by two fellow students Ryuuji Sakamoto and Ann Takamaki, and a shape-shifting cat-like creature known as Morgana. Feeling suppressed by their environment, the four form a group known as the "Phantom Thieves of Heart" to steal corrupt hearts of adults and reform society.
