## Sinopse

Hiraku's a slightly moody college student who's been having a hard time getting used to his new big-city life. A flamboyantly gay guy's latched onto him like a leech and follows him around wherever he goes, and a girl who he had a one-night stand with comes up to him telling him that she's pregnant and demands money from him so that she can go and get an abortion.

Amidst all this chaos, one glaring question crystallizes in the minds of all those around him ---who is it that he really loves?
