A flamboyantly gay guy's latched onto him like a leech and follows him around wherever he goes, and a girl who he had a one-night stand with comes up to him telling him that she's pregnant and demands money from him so that she can go and get an abortion.\n\nAmidst all this chaos, one glaring question crystallizes in the minds of all those around him ---who is it that he really loves?\n\nAlso contains\n\n-   Ichigo no Seikatsu (いちごの生活)\n-   Shitsumonshiyou (しつもんしよう。)\n\n(Source: JShoujo Scans)",
