## Sinopse

Kagurai Yuki belongs to a secret government unit that investigates incidents which involve any supernatural or psychic connections. The unit consists of 5 agents, all of whom have psychic powers themselves, and are overseen by their female boss.

The stories mostly consist of case file stories, but there is also an underlying arc that deals with Yuki, his mother, and Yuki's ever growing psychic powers.
