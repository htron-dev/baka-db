Her story includes the opinions and reactions of all of the people around her, as well as the actions of her own life. The chapters explore the thoughts and feelings of classmates and adults, men and women. The males often have romantic or sexual feelings for Hibari, while the women sometimes have feelings of inferiority or jealousy.
