## Sinopse

Mao, the demon-king-like genius pro tennis player, and Hikaru, the sadistic and intellectual player, are rivals from when they were juniors! ...it was supposed to be like that, but he's always looking at me whether it's during the game or not. Furthermore, he suddenly asked me to go out on a date and even French kissed me...! I can't stop my heart from beating fast, could this be... love?!
