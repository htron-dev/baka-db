    "sinopse": "The Soul Score... that is something not unlike the threads of fate which tell the story of a person's life from the minute they are born to the finale of death. Few people can see this score, even fewer can manipulate it.\n\nAfter being hit by a car and nearly killed, Kyosuke Hibiki can see and hear this mysterious soul score. Soon after, he meets a girl named Tena, a \"tuner\" who is able to manipulate the score and remove discordant notes to bring it back into tune. Tena is determined to make Kyosuke her pet, but Kyosuke is none too fond of it. Yet, the two begin their dissonant duet...\n\n(Source: Manga-Heaven)",
