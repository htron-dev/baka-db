    "sinopse": "One night, Hiyama, a police officer working in a small neighborhood police station, provides counselling for a college student, Okazaki, who had attempted to flash his body at people. Hiyama, unable to leave the naive Okazaki alone, who only resorted to what he did as he was unable to properly vent out his peculiar fetish, called out to Okazaki asking, \"If you're fine with me, shall I keep you company?\" And from then on, the days of their secret meetings kept from everyone in a unrecognized hotel began...?!\n\n(Source: Gentosha Comics, translated)",
