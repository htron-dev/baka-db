## Sinopse

‘Salaryman from Hell’ is the first in a collection of Ebisu’s stories entitled “The Man Who Saw Hell.” It’s about the day in the life of a normal Japanese salaryman. For the uninitiated, salarymen are an iconic figure in modern Japan, taking the role of everyman. Ebisu uses this generic salaryman figure in most of his stories.
