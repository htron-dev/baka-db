## Sinopse

A planet-threatening space disease, the "demon flu", has infected an inhabitant of Earth, and a space doctor is needed! The Space Medical Bureau has chosen Dr. Rurru for the job, but -- unfortunately for Minao Hitoharu, the infected patient -- she has a tendency to mishear and misspeak (with a mind towards ecchi) to comical effect.
