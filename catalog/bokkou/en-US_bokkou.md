## Sinopse

The story takes place 2300 years ago in China. The town of Ryo has requested the help of a clan called Bokk to aide them as their town is facing attack. The Bokk clan's representative, Kakuri, responds to their call for help and attempts to save Ryo from an almost inevitable defeat, from not only outer forces, but also from those who doubt him within. Is he up to the challenge?
