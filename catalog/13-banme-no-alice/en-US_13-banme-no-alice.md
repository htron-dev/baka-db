## Sinopse

14-year-old Alice is a descendant of the Kujouin clan, known for its attitude of superiority, and lives by her own self-determined rules of behavior as she aims to be the perfect lady. One day not long before her 15th birthday, a mysterious girl appears, who calls Alice the Thirteenth, and herself the Third, and that she have come to awaken the power that sleeps inside Alice.

Alice's peaceful school life is interrupted by harsh trials. What is the secret inside her? She's proud, mean and selfish, but also somewhat kind.

The story of this young lady Alice and her "high gothic action" starts here.
