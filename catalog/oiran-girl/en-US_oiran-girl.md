## Sinopse

Eight years ago, Tsubaki, a daughter of a successful businessman, was reluctantly given to the Yoshiwara, the red light district of Tokyo, after a tragic fire burned down the entire family's wealth and belongings. Shin, a childhood friend of Tsubaki's, coldly turned his back on her now that she was poor. Furious, Tsubaki, threw herself into becoming a top oiran girl to beguile him with her looks and then reject him one day! But plans are never as easy as they seem. For one, the beautiful and cold-hearted Takao stands in her way.
