    "sinopse": "The story is set in modern day downtown Tokyo. Our heroine Handa Sen, known as “Osen,” is the star hostess of the longstanding Isho-an, everyone’s favorite restaurant in the town of Kasagi-no-yado. Osen not only loves sake and looks sexy in kimono, but she’s also a “jill” of all trades: She’s a master chef, entertainer and potter, as well as an art connoisseur. The comic is about how Osen settles all the happenings surrounding Isho-an. Sometimes she resolves them with the Japanese spirit of “wa,” or by just being plain logical.\n\nThe artist’s delicate depiction of our heroine Osen in kimono, various craft including pottery and food is a highlight of this manga\n\n(source: Kodanclub.com)",
