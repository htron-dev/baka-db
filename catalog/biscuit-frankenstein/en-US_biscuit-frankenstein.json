The \"end of the world\" that was talked half in doubt since Nostradamus' prediction was finally proven wrong.\n      But unknown to the public, an abnormal phenomenon was starting to spread. A \"Disease\" which disturbs the normal cell division process, making young girls' body rot alive, slowly killing them. And a beautiful and grotesque being born from this disease, guided by a hapless fate, starts walking on the borderline between good will and ill will, with the wafting sweet scent of death.",
