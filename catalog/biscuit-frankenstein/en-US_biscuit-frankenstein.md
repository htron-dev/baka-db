## Sinopse

1999. The "end of the world" that was talked half in doubt since Nostradamus' prediction was finally proven wrong.
      But unknown to the public, an abnormal phenomenon was starting to spread. A "Disease" which disturbs the normal cell division process, making young girls' body rot alive, slowly killing them. And a beautiful and grotesque being born from this disease, guided by a hapless fate, starts walking on the borderline between good will and ill will, with the wafting sweet scent of death.
