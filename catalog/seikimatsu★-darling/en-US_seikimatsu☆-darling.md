## Sinopse

Everyone's favorite "darlings" from the hit OVA are back! This time around, the rowdy couple of Sentarou Katsura and Sanshirou Sakamoto suffer trials and tribulations when their mutual "friend," Youichirou Takasugi, warns Sakamoto of an inevitable break-up with Sentarou. Disturbed by this revelation, Sakamoto decides to tail Sentarou around town. But just as his "investigation" is beginning, Sakamoto's dad visits, commanding him to marry and settle down. In fact, the bride has already been chosen: none other than Takasugi's sister!

Amidst all the confusion, will Sentarou end up eating his promise of trying to do everything he can to make Sakamoto happy? And what about all the other couples? The couplings of Takasugi x Ogata, Shikibu x Tsutsumi, Todoroki x Takeru and Kitasenju x Juujou all collide in this volume—with babies in-tow! It's one riot of a manga indeed!
