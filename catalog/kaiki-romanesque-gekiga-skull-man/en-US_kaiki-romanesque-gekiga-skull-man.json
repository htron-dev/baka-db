    "sinopse": "When the looming Cold War shrouded Japan, mysterious murders were reported there. The suspect was a man with a skull-like helmet and a cape and clothing as black as the inside of a grave.\n\nAccompanied by a shape-shifting beast named Garo, the Skull Man terrified Japanese society—without giving the people a clear reason why.\n\n(Source: MU)",
