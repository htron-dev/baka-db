    "sinopse": "Professional wrestler Yamamoto Jingo just returned to Japan from a 5 year training trip in the US and Mexico, only to be greeted by his now defunct wrestling company: Yamato. He's come to find out that as soon as the president of the company passed away, the rival wrestling group \"Teijitsu\" took down Yamato. Jingo has now been forced to go seek revenge for the destruction of Yamato by challenging the Teijitsu president. One thing led to another, and now Jingo has been half-forced into working under Teijitsu as the new wrestler from Brazil: Agnes Kamen.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
