    "sinopse": "Second part of the Miriam series.\n\nThe super child, Miriam, has grown up and is perhaps falling in love. Yet Douglas, who used to be the leader of the teenage ruffians and is 9 years older than Miriam (though rumoured to have the mentality of a 17 year old) only sees her as a child. So! Douglas, stop the time and wait for me... while I go off to the next town, fall from a cliff, lose my memory, and find myself involved in a criminal intrigue!!!\n\n(Source: skynet)",
