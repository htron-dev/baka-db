## Sinopse

Third and final part of the Miriam series.

Finally, Miriam and Douglas are a couple... sort of. With Douglas' unromantic, awkward ways and his determination not to fall head-over-heels in love with her, Miriam sees no romance in their future.

But enter an assassin bent on killing Douglas for the damage he caused the criminal Cartel in "Jikan wo Tomete," and maybe things will turn out a little more romantic...in a way.
