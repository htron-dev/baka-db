## Sinopse

Shun Hayasaka is a cross-dresser in high school who secretly enjoys posting pictures of himself in drag online. This earns him several fans, one of whom is Yasuda, a 32-year-old man suffering from depression who has trouble communicating with others. After they meet up in real life and start having sex on a regular basis, Shun is unsure what to do when Yasuda starts expressing more interest in him than just as a sexual partner.
