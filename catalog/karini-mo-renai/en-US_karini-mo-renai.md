## Sinopse

Office worker Arisawa thinks that love is troublesome, so he keeps having one-night stands. But he and university student Tomohiro have something between them after Tomohiro drags him out of the bar. It was just supposed to be one of Arisawa's usual one-night stands but Tomohiro says, "Let's go out!" Of course, Arisawa immediately declines. But due to Tomohiro's persistent words, they end up dating for two months as a trial?
