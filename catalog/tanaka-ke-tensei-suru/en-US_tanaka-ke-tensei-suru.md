## Sinopse

An ordinary family that loves cats. One day, the whole Tanaka family died during a major earthquake. When they woke up, they were reincarnated as the Stuart family, a noble family from another world.

Though everyone is dressed in the Western style, they have memories of their previous Japanese lives. Even though they’re confused, they've gotten used to living in another world.
