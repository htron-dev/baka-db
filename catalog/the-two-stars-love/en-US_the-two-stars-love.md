## Sinopse

Junhee Lee is an average high school girl. She's pretty dense, you could say, and she's a tough girl willing to beat up anyone who ticks her off in one teensy second! She's the Jjang of her high school, but she didn't even know it. She had beaten the previous Jjang on the first day of school- but let's just say she thought the Jjang was a phony. He was just too weak! Junhee is obsessed with the boy band "OZ", and she's starstruck when she's faced with her favorite member! But her rival-in-love is a pop singer, and they must fight fight fight!
