## Sinopse

Biological twins—and they couldn't be more different. Friendly outgoing Anzu is in love with Makoto, but can't work up the nerve to confess. Shy withdrawn Ichigo (the one with the glasses) was a stalking victim and now hates men. But they're going to need each other to cope with a huge change in their lives. Their mother has remarried and the twins discover they've gained a brother as well; clever and carefree Kenta. And Kenta (with Makoto) has a plan to help Ichigo—just make the twins trade identities!
