## Sinopse

Myne, who was aimed at for her magical power by nobles, decided to part ways with her family and friends. Renamed "Rosemyne" she starts a new life as the adopted daughter of a lord so that no danger will befall those important to her. However, her days in the noble society were harsh. In addition to intense special training to learn ceremonies and etiquette, the responsibility of presiding over the temple and the orphanage is heavy. It is too much for a sickly little girl... However, the reward for this from the head priest was "the key to the temple library!" A biblio-fantasy written for book lovers and bookworms! The third part begins!
