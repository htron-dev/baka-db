    "sinopse": "\"God, even if I'm reincarnated, please let me keep reading lots of books...\"\n\nThis was the dying wish of Urano Motosu, a university student who loved to read books, no matter the genre or type. She treasured books to such an extent that she aimed to graduate with a librarian's certificate—which she was on the verge of acquiring if it weren't for an earthquake that caused her bookshelf to collapse and crush her to death. Though she may not have been granted the job of her dreams, she was at least granted another chance at life.\n\nAwakening as a frail five-year-old girl named Maine, she finds herself in a foreign medieval city populated by people with strange-colored hair. This new world fascinates Maine, but her lack of strength and the low status of her family and shelter disappoints her. To make things worse, she realizes that public literacy is low and books are rare and expensive in this city. Although Maine's past life has ended, her love for books has not—and thus begins the story of this bookworm's quest to make her own books.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
