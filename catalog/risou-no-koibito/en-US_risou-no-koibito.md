## Sinopse

Riku suffered a traumatizing experience after coming out and has since chosen to avoid love. That is until the super-confident and dominating pretty-boy, Yoshimi, walks into his life. He deliberately targets Riku's weaknesses, but what are his true intentions?

This is a story of discipline, guidance and affection that fills both the heart and body of the handsome and brutish Yoshimi and the naturally timid Riku.
