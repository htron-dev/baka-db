    "sinopse": "Riku suffered a traumatizing experience after coming out and has since chosen to avoid love. That is until the super-confident and dominating pretty-boy, Yoshimi, walks into his life. He deliberately targets Riku's weaknesses, but what are his true intentions?\n\nThis is a story of discipline, guidance and affection that fills both the heart and body of the handsome and brutish Yoshimi and the naturally timid Riku.\n\n(Source: Blissful Sin)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Furueru Te no Saki (Before Trembling Hands)",
