From Psycho Pandas:
Glasses Cafe GLASS is...
A cafe where all the garcons wear glasses. For the sake of women who like glasses, the garcons are all beauties that wear glasses. It's a specialty cafe. From the start, the owner hired exceptional men as garcons.

And then at that time a puzzling event occurred...!?
This cafe of boundless peril is the astray Kotaro's fate!
