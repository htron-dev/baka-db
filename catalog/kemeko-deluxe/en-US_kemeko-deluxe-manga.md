## Sinopse

Ten years ago, high-school student Sanpeita dreamed he was engaged to a beautiful girl. One morning, an unknown homely girl suddenly pressed him for marriage. The homely girl was named Kemeko.

In order to escape, Sanpeita left for school where Kemeko followed and showed up with an uproar. A larger disturbance was when Sanpeita was targeted by a rice cooker on the school's rooftop.

As Sanpeita and his childhood friend Izumi were being attacked by the rice cooker, Kemeko saved them both. What is the girl's true shape!?
