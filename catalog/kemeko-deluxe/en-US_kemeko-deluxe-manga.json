The homely girl was named Kemeko.\n\nIn order to escape, Sanpeita left for school where Kemeko followed and showed up with an uproar. A larger disturbance was when Sanpeita was targeted by a rice cooker on the school's rooftop.\n\nAs Sanpeita and his childhood friend Izumi were being attacked by the rice cooker, Kemeko saved them both. What is the girl's true shape!?\n\n(Source: Dynasty Scans)",
