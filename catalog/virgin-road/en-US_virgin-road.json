    "sinopse": "\"I'm ready to spread my wings and fly.\"\n\nAll her life Kris Laurensen had been trapped in the silken prison of her family's immense wealth. Decisions were made for her by her stepmother and her dynamic guardian, Jared Chayse-including the decision that she should marry Jared!\n\nKris was shocked. The match would cement a financial empire but what about her feelings for Jared, feelings that veered crazily between attraction and resentment?\n\nReturning to Sydney from finishing school in Europe, Kris had been eager to taste her freedom, to experience life. Instead, she was being forced to contemplate marriage to a man who might never love her.\n\n(Source: FictionDB)",
