## Sinopse

Who has not heard of the famous Shinsengumi, the terrible faction of nationalist samurai? But when its four most eminent members are teleported to contemporary Kyoto, nothing goes well... Where has this Japan full of values that they love so much gone to?! At first lost, these famous male warriors will regain their senses. Yet one question remains: will they succeed in turning their country around which is in full decay?! Nothing is sure for certain...
