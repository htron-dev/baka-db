## Sinopse

Although the mangaka and editor are partners on the job, they have, in some ways, a relationship that is more "deep" than that of lovers. Though unfortunately for Touko Futaba, not only is her series suddenly discontinued due to a slump in popularity but the editor in charge of the project deserts her, leaving her on the verge of throwing herself off a cliff. A new editor, Akimito, then decides to step in, and his high expectations strikes Futuba's heart with the desire to work sincerely once again and helps her regain support for her work.
