## Sinopse

Mylene loves fun things. Whether it be fine arts, sculptures, drawings, or music, she loves them all. However, all those things had gradually disappeared due to the long-standing war. Thus, she decides to cast a time freezing magic on herself to awaken at a period after the war. Waking up 2000 years later, there was only a wasteland around her. Thus began her leisurely life with her golem maid. However, meeting with the villagers, that takes a turn. Will her wish to live a leisurely life be granted?
