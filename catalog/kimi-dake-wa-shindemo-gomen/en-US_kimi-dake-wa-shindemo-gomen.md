## Sinopse

The studious and revered Mitsuko Yagami shows her love for Yui Souichirou in a slightly unconventional way: she admires him from afar, keeps track of his daily movements, and knows every minute detail about him. She would hardly call herself a stalker. No, that term is reserved for Chiyo Touma, a classmate who goes as far as to hide wiretaps on Mitsuko's person and track her every movement.

Chiyo's intrusion on Mitsuko's love is the bane of her existence. However, there isn't much she can do while trying to maintain her image as the perfect student. What's in store for the stalker who meets her stalker?
