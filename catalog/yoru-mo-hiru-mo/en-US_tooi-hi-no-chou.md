## Sinopse

Gifted pianist Saki wants nothing more than to see his young cousin—the talented Riya—succeed as a professional musician. So why is a (handsome) face from Saki's past suddenly threatening to tear him away from reality? Will this fragile butterfly finally learn to ride the winds of change with grace and maturity—or will he get swept away in a reckless moment?
