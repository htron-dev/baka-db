    "sinopse": "The middle schoolers Utahara Koharu and Hanaeda Yousuke are childhood friends, nothing more or less. At least according to Koharu, since Yousuke is dead set on making her his wife in the future and doesn't refrain from telling her how much he loves her at every possible occasion. With Koharu being torn between annoyance and embarassment, this manga depicts their daily life and interactions with their families, classmates and friends.\n\n(Source: MU)",
