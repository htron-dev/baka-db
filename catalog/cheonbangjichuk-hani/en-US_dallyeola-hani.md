## Sinopse

Hany is a small tomboy and slightly troublesome teenager who lives life a bit carelessly on her own since her Father lives abroad due to work in the Middle East and her Mother died when she was very small. The only thing Hany is very good at is running~ fast! Hong Du-kke is a new track and field coach of her school and takes notice in her talent and gets her to train with him.
