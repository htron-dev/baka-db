Tamaki is an only child brought up by her mother alone. But then, her mother passed away due to an illness, and now she has no relatives. When she visited the Ootori family - a family that's totally strange to her - according to her mother's will, the one waiting for her was Shinga, a super rich and hot guy, but also extremely arrogant and horrible. Suddenly, he declares that starting today, she's his wife, and he stole her first kiss?!
