    "sinopse": "Maaya Suou, A high school girl who was called \"Wolf Girl\" in the past, was living her usual everyday life. \"I don't want to get involved in extraordinary events anymore...\" Even though Maya decided that, she was suddenly dragged into a fight between a \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and a \"Wolf.\" Maya smirked unconsciously. \"I have a plan. I also have the means. Ending everything here despite that would be such a waste and I won't allow it.\" And so began this dark fairy tale as the wolf fell in love.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
