## Sinopse

"In Tokyo, anyone can become the protagonist of a love story."

Nagao Kanji has recently moved to Tokyo where he now finds himself uneagerly working at a small advertising firm. He reconnects with an old friend from back home, Mikami Kenichi, a medical student from a wealthy household who never lacks female company. For years, the two have shared a crush for their childhood classmate, the kindhearted and innocent Sekiguchi Satomi, who now also lives in Tokyo. Mixing things up is Akana Rika, an addictively cheerful girl working at Kanji's company who decides that she will call him by the nickname of "Kanchi."

Tokyo Love Story is Saimon Fumi's masterpiece manga about the relationships between these four young adults living in bubble era Tokyo.
