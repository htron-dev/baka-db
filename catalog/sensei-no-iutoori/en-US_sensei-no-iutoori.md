## Sinopse

Beautiful but unemotional Ishimoro sensei has always been chased by women and has become an "expert at romance", despite never being involved in it. Students and teachers both always ask for his advice. The only one who doesn't is gym teacher Yamada who seems to hate him with a passion for some unknown reason.
