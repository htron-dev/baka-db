Ye Chen, who is an ancient god, has fallen from the world of the gods to the world of the blue world. Here, hundreds of thousands of countries are standing, and the heroes are fighting for hegemony. Ye Chen has been in this pale blue world for hundreds of years and has established a huge force. In Baizhou Qianguo, the existence of Ye Chen has always been a legend. But the power from the world of the gods slowly extended to the blue world, and a cruel dragon battle is about to begin. In the capital city of Nanzhou, the first battle of Tianbei State, Hong Xu and the Wulong two men of Nanzhou Shuangyuemen Gate competed outside the Huashen Palace, but they were defeated in the hands of Su Xiaoxiao, the group leader of the Huashen Palace.
