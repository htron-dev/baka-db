    "sinopse": "Futon\nAfter eloping, Madoka and Tomio should have been happy. But shortly afterwards, Tomio refuses to leave his futon. As he burrows in its folds, what sort of unseen horror is he hiding from?\n\nMokuzou no Kai (Wooden Spirit)\nMore than anything else, Megumi and her father are proud of their house's pedigree, as it has been recently honored as a national tangible cultural property. This renown draws the interest of architecture student Manami Kino, who ends up boarding alongside the father-daughter pair. As Manami becomes more ingrained in their lives, she reveals tell-tale signs of her love for the house.\n\nTomio: Akai High-neck (Tomio・Red Turtleneck)\nClad in a crimson turtleneck and clutching the sides of his head, Tomio begs for his ex-girlfriend Madoka's help. The enchanting fortune-teller who stole his heart now wants to steal another thing—Tomio's head. Lacerations wind around his neck, and the only thing keeping him whole is the waning strength of his hands.\n\nYuruyaka na Wakare (Gentle Goodbye)\nAgainst his family's wishes, Makoto Tokura marries Riko. Soon, she learns of the family's special ritual. They have the ability to bring back the ghosts of the dead, calling them \"afterimages.\" After a couple of decades, these afterimages will fade, but they grant family members the chance to say a gentle goodbye to loved ones. Riko hopes the family can bring back the afterimage of her father when he dies, but even after years, they still don't approve of her. What secret could they be hiding?\n\nKaibou-chan (Dissection-chan)\nAt Chuo Medical University, students prepare to dissect cadavers to study their anatomy. However, one group is in for a surprise when they unwrap their body bag to discover the woman inside is still alive! Ruriko Tamiya is a psychotic girl obsessed with being dissected. As a child, she would carve open small animals' stomachs while her unwilling accomplice Tatsuro Kamata would hold them down.\n\nTatsuro was able to escape her influence, but now, eight years later, she begs him to open her stomach. What horrors lurk beneath her veneer of skin?\n\nKuroi Tori (Blackbird)\nCrippled in the wilderness, Shiro Moriguchi survived for a month off the provisions in his backpack... or so he says. In truth, his survival depended on a mysterious bird-woman who fed him regurgitated raw meat. However, even Moriguchi's rescue can't save him from her far too \"caring\" tendencies, as she continues to force-feed him meat and organs of unknown origin.\n\nNanakuse Magami (Magami Nanakuse)\nMagami Nanakuse is a talented author, whose stories focus on people with strange habits called \"tics.\" Despite their obscure status, Magami's books are addicting. One such avid fan is Kaoru Koketsu. An aspiring novelist herself, Kaoru receives the chance of a lifetime when Magami invites Kaoru to visit. However, this visit doesn't turn out happy; Magami declares Kaoru a \"tic faker,\" ranting on the poor girl. After drinking together, their conversation leads Magami to see a spark of potential in Kaoru—the ultimate tic.\n\nMimikosuru Onna (Whispering Woman)\nMayumi Santo only knows how to live by taking orders. Should she sit, and if so, how should she sit? Does she lower her bottom first, or does she bend her knees first? Every one of Mayumi's actions requires strict direction for her to feel sane. Though her father Shigeki loves her, he is at wits' end as every caretaker eventually quits. His saving grace comes in the form of Mitsu Uchida, a beautiful young lady who offers to become the next caretaker.\n\nDespite Shigeki's initial misgivings, Mitsu proves to be more adept than any before her. Still, the mystery remains—just who is Mitsu Uchida, and for what reasons does she go to such lengths to care for Mayumi?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
