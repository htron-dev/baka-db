    "sinopse": "In the summer, siblings Michina and Yuusuke Hirose visit their distant relatives in the countryside. Though they haven't met in years, they quickly find that they're in for a relaxing vacation: they get along well with their cousins Kouchi and Sayuri Tsujii, there's a pool within walking distance, and the scenery is ever refreshing. There is just one blight upon this otherwise lovely trip: Souichi Tsujii, the bratty third Tsujii child and black sheep of the family.\n\nNail-sucking, occult-loving, and utterly mischievous, Souichi's idea of amusement is anything that makes others squirm. Whether its throwing curses on his cousins, bewitching his classmates, or replacing his teachers with living dolls, Souichi finds all kinds of ways to ruin the fun that he's left out of. But even with his own mystical powers, his havoc never lasts too long: for when Souichi causes trouble, it always comes back his way.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\n1. Fun Summer Vacation\n2.
