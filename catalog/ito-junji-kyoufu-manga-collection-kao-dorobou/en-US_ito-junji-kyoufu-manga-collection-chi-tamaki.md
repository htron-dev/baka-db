## Sinopse

Chidamagi (Blood-bubble Bushes)
During a joyride through the countryside, lovers Ansai and Kana crash when a splatter of blood hits their windshield. Unable to discern where the blood came from or to get their car working again, the couple venture off the road for help. Though they come across a group of boys, these eerie children only attack the couple and attempt to suck their blood. Chased into an abandoned village, the pair find shelter in a mansion occupied by the village's sole inhabitant. Staying the night, the man begins to recount to them a strange and sorrowful tale of his past, the tragic circumstances of the town, and the existence of a phenomena known as blood-bubbles that links them all.

Taegatai Meiro (Unbearable Labyrinth)
Sayako is a troubled youth who has stopped attending school due to a personal trauma. Out of concern, her friend Noriko takes her on a hike in the calm mountainside, hoping to convince her to return. They get lost on the trail and come across a group of monks. However, their requests for assistance are only met by vacant stares from the gaunt men. Their superior explains that the monks are in training and that the girls have stumbled upon a sacred area, one that is hard to enter, and hard to leave. The girls are invited to spend the night at the temple, where they will find out the extremes that the monks will go through to achieve their nirvana.

Re-Animator no Tsurugi (Sword of the Re-Animator)
On a night of ghost hunting, Keiji Soga witnesses a whole swarm of spectres heading in a single direction. He tracks them down to find them entering the body of a cloaked man. Noticing the witness, the strange man unsheathes his mystical sword and attempts to silence Keiji. Though Keiji manages to escape, he finds that this is not the last time he will meet this man, and that they are more connected than he knows.

Isho (The Will)
Hiroko's younger sister Taeko has committed suicide by jumping in front of a train. A note she left behind reveals she killed herself out of hatred, but her blood obscured who the letter was addressed to. Taeko had always felt that Hiroko was treated better than her, and died after finding out she was adopted, causing Hiroko and her family to fear they may have been the cause of Taeko's death. When a vengeful spirit appears in their house, they start to fear that their worries have been realized...

Hashi (The Bridge)
After receiving a worrying call from her grandmother Osode, Kanako decides to visit her village. Upon arriving, an old figure stands at the bridge, but much to her horror, Kanako finds that this figure is a walking corpse. Osode explains that the man is actually her long-deceased uncle, and is tethered to the mortal realm as a result of the village's unique funeral practice. However, this single entity is not Osode's main problem; as of late, all the trapped souls of the village have appeared, urging Osode to join them in their rest.

Akuma no Riron (The Devil’s Logic/Demonology)
Kazumi Morimoto was a cheerful schoolgirl eager to go on her first date with her crush. One hour later, she jumped off her school's roof to her demise. Her classmate Okamori could only watch this scene helplessly, leaving him puzzled as to what would lead her to such an act. However, when a tape recorder that he had mischievously slipped into her bag prior finds its way back to him, he realizes that it will serve as a key to the mystery. As Okamori listens to the tape, he comes to hear of the sinister being that Morimoto met in her last hour...

Aibeya (The Conversation Room)
Following a sudden car accident, Hashimoto awakens in a hospital ward. She finds herself in the company of Sugie, the woman she crashed into, and four other female patients. Though Sugie proves unbearable by pinning all the blame on Hashimoto, she finds herself more taken aback by the four women and their strange behaviour. This quartet acts in unison, claim that their hearts are one, and even seem to share the same dreams. Above all, they do not wish to be separated. As she spends more time in the hospital, Hashimoto starts to learn about the horrifying truth behind these women and the danger of staying with them.
