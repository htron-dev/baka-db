Souichi Series
Souichi Tsujii, lover of all things wicked and occult, returns to do what he does best: casting mischief and curses on those around him.

And like always, his shenanigans tend to backfire on him, though this time they may have a more lasting effect...

Amateur scriptwriter Iwasaki awakens one day to a bad feeling, which means something very unpleasant is inbound. Flipping through a fashion magazine, he comes across an eerie model who sports a visage straight from a nightmare. Her unsettling countenance haunts Iwasaki for weeks and festers in his mind, growing more and more monstrous. It is only with the passage of time that this frightening image fades away. However, when his film crew decides to open casting calls for their next project, his disturbing premonition returns once more...
