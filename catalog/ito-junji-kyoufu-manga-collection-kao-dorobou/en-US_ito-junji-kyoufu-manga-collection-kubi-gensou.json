    "sinopse": "Tooru Oshikiri is a quiet boy of short stature and few friends. While his parents are out working abroad, he lives alone in a big mansion, compounding his loneliness and affecting his grip on reality. Moreover, strange things tend to happen to him and those he gets involved with. Grappling with harrowing hallucinations of long-necked people, a haunted bog rumoured to trap its victims, a strange girl with even stranger penpals, and the mysterious circumstances within his own house, it seems the supernatural is all but an inevitable occurrence for Oshikiri. Yet with each inexplicable occurrence, his reality alters slightly between the last. Just what is the truth behind these discrepancies? Is this really happening to the same Oshikiri?\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\n1. Hallucinations\n2. Bog of the Living Dead\n3. Penpal\n4. Intruder\n5. Further Tales of Oshikiri\n6.
