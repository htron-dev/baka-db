## Sinopse

Ever since he was a child, Ryou has always looked very feminine. One day, a couple of girls from his class force him to put on make-up and to wear a girl's uniform. While he was walking around, he meets Kazuaki, who immediately takes interest in him and simply refuses to believe that Ryou is actually a boy.
