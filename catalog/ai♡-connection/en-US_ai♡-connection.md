## Sinopse

Just as the new semester begins, a sophomore named Yosuke Yamada from Sakurazawa High School is feeling bummed out—he got his license suspended after helping a girl on a motorcycle who was being chased by a patrol car.

Now, Yosuke has gotten a call from the head of the Sakurazawa High School Biker Gang. What could the boss of this group of delinquent girls, Takami Icon, want with him?! After talking, it seems they're looking for a new sub-leader for the group, and they want to play a little game to see if he can survive a bike race without any light in the middle of the night. It seems Yosuke couldn't help but be worried...
