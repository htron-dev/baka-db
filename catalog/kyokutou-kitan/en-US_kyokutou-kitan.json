Only Kuki, the weird roaming doctor, who can treat the most mysterious illnesses, could answer that question, but he is focused on his research, investigating on the disappearance of the turtle nation and on the coming of the tide that will soon submerge Japan. So it begins his trip discovering the tales from the Far East.",
