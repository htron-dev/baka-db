    "sinopse": "Sakura just has to get close to the super-handsome Chika, so she's willing to take on a job as a waiter. That's right, a waiter. She's so determined that she lies about her gender on her job application. As Sakura gets close to Chika, she discovers that though he's got an angelic face, he's a devilish tease. Will she let that deter her? No way!\n\n(Source: Shoujo Manga Maniac)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Itsuka Omoide ni Naru Koi ni",
