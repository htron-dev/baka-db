## Sinopse

Ever since being cast aside by his ex-lover, Sei Hikawa became a feckless man. He let his hair grow unkempt, without care for his appearance. This aimless way of his is changed by the appearance of a certain man. Wearing a suit and an expensive watch, Kengo Haruki directs Sei and helps him polish both his physical appearance and build his character. But what Kengo wants as compensation is Sei's body...
