## Sinopse

As a child Tanabe was always tagging behind Haruyama, but in high school after he became a ping pong ace their
relationship is gradually getting worse. Who is the one tagging along for real and why is Tanabe always so quiet? A touching and yet funny story with ping pong as it's background. This volume also contains a one-shot about one very interesting hairdresser and
a two-chapter story about a dentist and his fated client.
