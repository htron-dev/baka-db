## Sinopse

During a scuffle with some classmates, I fell from a bridge and found myself in a medieval-like alternative world. It was a world where the only female sexual outlets for men are manufactured sex toys known as Dolls, and real women are rare, practically mythical beings prized for the basest of reasons. In ongoing danger because of my gender, I find myself saved by Shin, one of the boys from my world who came here with me during the fight. He may once have humiliated me then, but now, for some reason, I can’t get him off of my mind...
