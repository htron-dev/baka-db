## Sinopse

A dark stop motion anime about a lone traveler in a desert who finds a solitary box. When he opens it, he finds a rundown and rather spooky city made up of large tower block apartments. Suddenly, a mysterious ghostly stick entity appears and seems to follow our hero. What is the purpose of this strange figure?
