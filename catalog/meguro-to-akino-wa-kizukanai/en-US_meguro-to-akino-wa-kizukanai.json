    "sinopse": "The source of undergraduate Meguro's worries are his straight friend, Akino, who falls in love too much for his own good. Even though he knows Meguro is gay, Akino will always end up hanging out at Meguro's place after being dumped by his girlfriend. \"Nothing but your cooking, the smell of your room... and the touch of hard muscles will heal me!!\" So saying, Akino pushes down Meguro to touch him all over, and on top of that kisses him and they jerk off together!! Their friends have all agreed, \"You two are definitely going out!!\" but the two are absolutely unaware...?!\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)",
