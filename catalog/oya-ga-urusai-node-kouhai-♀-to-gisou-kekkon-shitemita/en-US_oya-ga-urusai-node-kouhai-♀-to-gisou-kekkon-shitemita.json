    "sinopse": "Machi Morimoto is a girl who is expected to settle down, get married, and become a stay-at-home mother. Her parents nag her about finding a suitor but she is neither interested in nor understands love. In an attempt to stop her parents from controlling her life any more than they do, she marries her best friend Hana Agaya, who lost her job and needed a place to crash.\n\nHana is into girls, and she's had a crush on Machi since high school. Machi though, has never experienced the tender feeling of loving or being loved, while Hana is charismatic and outgoing, always doing what she loves and having fun.\n\nAs the short manga comes to a swift end, only time will tell if their fake marriage will allow true love to flourish or end up driving them apart.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shot: Musanso Renai (Anaerobic Love)",
