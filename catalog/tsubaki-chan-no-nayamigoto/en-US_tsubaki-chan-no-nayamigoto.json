    "sinopse": "Tsubaki started going out with Yutaka who is in the same class after he confessed to her. No mails, very silent, at first she thought it was a \"mistake\" to go out with him but after realizing how pure/honest Yutaka is, Tsubaki gradually falls for him. So what are the worries that the two are facing..?\n\n(Source: Chibi Manga)",
