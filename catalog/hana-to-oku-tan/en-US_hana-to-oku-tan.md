## Sinopse

Momo, whose nickname is "Oku-tan," is a normal 25-year-old housewife whose hobby is to think about what she can prepare for her husband's dinner all day long. She lives with her pet rabbit P-tan in a Tokyo where a giant flower has for unknown reasons bloomed in the heart of the metropolis, destroying everything in its vicinity. Influenced by mutagenic chemicals released by the flower, the nearby plantlife has mutated and overrun the urban landscape, transforming it into the jungle now known as "Tokyo Forest."

Momo's husband has been missing since the blooming of the flower a year ago, but despite her family asking that she return home to Hokkaido, she insists on waiting for him. The story details her day-to-day life, and her various culinary adventures.

It's said that if the flower blooms a second time, the world will be destroyed...
