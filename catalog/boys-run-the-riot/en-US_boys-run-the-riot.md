## Sinopse

High schooler Ryou knows he's transgender, but he doesn't have anyone to confide in about the confusion he feels. He can't tell his best friend, who he's secretly got a crush on, and he can't tell his mom, who's constantly asking why Ryou is always "dressing like a boy." He certainly can't tell Jin, the new transfer student who looks like just another bully. The only time Ryou feels at ease is when he's wearing his favorite clothes. Then, and only then, the world melts away, and he can be his true self. One day, while out shopping, Ryou sees an unexpected sight: Jin. The kid who looked so tough in class is shopping for the same clothes that Ryou loves. And Jin offers Ryou a proposal: to start their own brand and create apparel to help everyone feel comfortable in their skin. At last, Ryou has someone he can open up to—and the journey ahead might finally give him a way to express himself to everyone else.
