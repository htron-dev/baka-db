## Sinopse

Despite being kind and considerate, Keitarou Itsuki has a menacing look in his eyes that scares away others. When Keitarou attempts to confess to Aoi Tokujira, she flatly rejects him, leading him to believe that his intimidating eyes are to blame. Confiding his worries to his older sister, she gives him a hand by offering a complete makeover. But much to Keitarou's surprise, she turns him into a girl!

Forced to head home in his new appearance, he unexpectedly comes across Aoi being harassed by a group of boys from their school, and rushes to her rescue. Surprisingly, she doesn't recognize him, and reveals a secret that she has held for a long time: she has an intense fear of men. Believing him to be a tomboyish girl, she asks Keitarou in his female guise to assist her in overcoming her fear.
