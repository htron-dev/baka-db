## Sinopse

Haru Jigokumeguri is the eldest daughter of a highly successful businessman, gifted with both intelligence and beauty. Kawayanagi Tsurezure is an eccentric boy who dresses in 20th century fashion and has a habit of gazing up at clouds for hours on end. Haru is prideful, arrogant, and egocentric, while Kawayanagi is unable to strike even the most basic of conversations. These shortcomings lead them to be shunned by the rest of their classmates, and so the two gravitate towards one another.

The lonely classmates find a mutual friend in Akane Tendou, a jolly girl who finds pleasure in seeing them together. Now, with their confidence restored, Haru and Kawayanagi embark on a journey towards bettering themselves.
