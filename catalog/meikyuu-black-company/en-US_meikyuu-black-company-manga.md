## Sinopse

Kinji, who lacks any kind of work ethic, is a layabout in his modern life. One day, he finds himself transported to another world—but not in a grand fantasy of a hero welcomed with open arms. He's immediately shoved into a terrible job! Now enslaved by an evil mining company in a fantasy world, Kinji's about to really learn the meaning of hard work!
