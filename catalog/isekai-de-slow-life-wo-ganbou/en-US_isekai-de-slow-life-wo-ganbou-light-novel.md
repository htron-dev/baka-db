## Sinopse

By the will of the goddess, Itsuki Shinomiya was given the privilege of choosing various abilities and being reborn in another world. However, before going to the other world, he didn't want to involve himself in scary, dirty, gross things like battles. Fiercely determined to live a slow life, he chose the unique skill [Pocket Money], giving him an amount of money once per day.

"With this, I can hang out with girls without having to work!"

Dreaming of avoiding battles and living with cute girls, Itsuki stepped into the other world! But the reality was not that simple. Getting attacked by giant bugs, getting caught up in arguments at the guild, and getting stuck with slaves?! In the end, will Itsuki be able to live his ideal slow life?! Using unique skills and manufacturing skills, an exciting other-world slow life with beautiful girls starts now!
