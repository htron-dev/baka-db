## Sinopse

Hiromu is a high school boy who has everything he could ever want: a normal life, friends, and a girlfriend. That is until one day Hiromu asks everyone where Tetsuya is and no one knows. All of his classmates think he is crazy for insisting that this Tetsuya person exists since no one has heard of him. Then on his way home from school Hiromu finally meets a boy who remembers Tetsuya and says that Tetsuya was "delicious" and this isn't the only strange occurrence. This boy seems to think that Hiromu's name is Glorious Lily and that his lover is not his girlfriend, but a beautiful, emotionless girl named Valeriana. With the help of this mysterious boy Hiromu uncovers his past, who Valeriana is and who, or what, he is.
