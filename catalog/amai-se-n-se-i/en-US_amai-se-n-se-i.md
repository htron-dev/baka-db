## Sinopse

Tsukimori Kaede is an editor for a mystery stories magazine. The writer that she's in charge of, Uesugi Kenji, always misses his deadline. Originally a fan of his works, Kaede sees attracted to him as a man by the gentleness that he sometimes shows her. However, he says that he won't consider women who work with him as possible lovers, so he wouldn't consider her at all. And then, her boss informed her that someone else will be in charge of him...?!
