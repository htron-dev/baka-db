## Sinopse

This alleged doctor actually has not medical degree (and even her real identity is unknown), , but that will not stop her from devoted her time to attend everybody with the more 'alternative' methods have ever been seen. Her master in this crusade pro malpractice will be Shisho, a talking pervert ball with moustache that comes from the nape of Liam herself and whose motto is "sexual harassment is of vital importance for the good work of modern society".

So this couple of therapists, with their comrades Naoto, Okazaki and Momji, star this manga replete of comedy and high doses of sexual content...
