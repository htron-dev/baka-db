## Sinopse

Since childhood, Remi Mochizuki has known that Sora Kitagami bears an extraordinary power: through physical touch, he experiences the thoughts and history of people and their possessions. Rather than be scared by this mysterious ability, Remi had decided long ago to never tell lies in order to stay by Sora's side. Recently, however, this has been difficult for her; despite being raised together, her feelings toward her brother figure have begun to transform.

When Keishi Mochizuki—Remi's actual brother and a former police detective who now runs his own investigation agency—requests Sora's assistance to resolve the disappearance of a young girl named Yukina Ueda, the two men are troubled by the victim's strong resemblance to Remi. Sora states, without a doubt, that Yukina was killed by her older brother Masaki. In the event that the murderer ever crosses paths with Remi, would the urge to repeat his crime re-emerge?
