    "sinopse": "After her father abandons their family and her mother dies, Miyuki Yagyuu is left solely in charge of her family's affairs, inheriting both riches and her father's business. Her relatives often quarrel over the distribution of wealth among the family, and as a result, Miyuki feels burdened by being her father's successor. She seeks comfort from her personal butler, Mikage, a young and handsome man who was adopted as a child to serve her.\n\nOne evening, Miyuki dreams about being intimate with Mikage; however, the man in her dream shows a side of him previously unbeknownst to her. As the dreams continue to flood her mind days later, she begins to question the truth of them. Are the people she sees in her dreams the real Miyuki and Mikage, or are they only figments of her imagination?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
