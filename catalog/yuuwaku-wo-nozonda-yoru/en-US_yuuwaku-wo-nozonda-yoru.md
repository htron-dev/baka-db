## Sinopse

While working part-time in a high-end department store in London during the Christmas season, Cassie recommends some candles to an especially gorgeous customer, who then buys half a dozen of them. When the man, Giancarlo, invites her to dinner, she turns him down. When he forgets to take his candles with him, she ends up delivering them herself. But when she arrives, a romantic dinner with a sexy man awaits her. Could there be any harm in sitting down at the table?
