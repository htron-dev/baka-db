## Sinopse

A man shows up not long after Marlene's mother and Paolo, her mother's wealthy, married lover, die. The man says he's a friend of Paolo's and that he wants to discuss Paolo's will with her. But then she overhears a cruel plot against her: "Seduce that low-class harlot who's looking for a sugar daddy and leave her without a single penny." Because Marlene, her mother and Paolo lived together as a family, the man has mistaken Marlene for Paolo's mistress... and decided to punish her!
