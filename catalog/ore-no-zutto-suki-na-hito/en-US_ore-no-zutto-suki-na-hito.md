## Sinopse

Youji has been pining after Noboru for 20 years! And not silently either! Youji’s been stalking his beloved and stealing away his girlfriends ever since they were in grade school. Noboru, on the other hand, can’t stand Youji’s stalker tendencies and doesn’t understand that all of Youji’s actions are out of love. Will Youji’s clumsy one-sided love ever reach Noboru?!
