## Sinopse

During the political upheavals and social strife at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan (1855), two parent-less brothers — Yukimura Shoutarou and Yukimura Gentarou — struggle to survive in these turbulent times. The brothers' only possession is their deceased father's sword and they cling onto the wisdom of their mother's final words as they seek to embark on the Path of the Warrior: Sidooh.
