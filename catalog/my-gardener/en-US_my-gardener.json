It is a light-hearted look weaving the day-to-day events of the heroine, a sixteen-year-old girl named Sana, and the family, friends and pet dog who make up her world. In the midst of this lurks a number of factors causing Sana to feel insecure, and leading her to search for a way to calm her feelings of anxiety and nervousness.\"\n\nExcerpt from Japanese Writers House website.
