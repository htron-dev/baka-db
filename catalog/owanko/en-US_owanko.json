    "sinopse": "He wears a bowl on his head and dances to the rhythms of Samba! What in the world is this creature? It is Owanco! He is a fairy dog who wears a bowl like a hat.\nHe loves food so much that he transforms himself into whatever food he pleases. His biggest fan and the admirer of tea-cupped-poodle, \"Pooko-chan\" and his rival cat, \"Nori-Tama\" (Nori=seaweed, Tama=the most typical name for cats in Japan) will join the fun ride.\nBy the way, what's for dinner tonight?\n\n(Source: Official YouTube Channel)",
