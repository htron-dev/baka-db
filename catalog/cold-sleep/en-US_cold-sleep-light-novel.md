## Sinopse

After losing his memory in a serious car accident, Tohru Takahisa is taken in by Fujishima, an older man who claims to be his friend. But the taciturn Fujishima refuses to reveal anything about Tohru's past! Despite the gulf between them, a strange and awkward tenderness grows, even as theyare held apart by the tragic events of Tohru's forgotten past! Dramatic, heart-wrenching romance and tragedy combine in a gripping story where the past and present are intricately entwined. This volume also contains the short story "Class Reunion" and an all-new sequel!
