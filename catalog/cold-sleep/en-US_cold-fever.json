    "sinopse": "Toru lost most of his memory in an accident, and can't remember anything that happened from the past six years. He feels as if he is a different person now, and he hates \"the other guy\"â€”the person he was six years ago. Miserable and emotionally drained, Toru is trying not to live in the shadow of his past... to move on with his new life... but, the harder he tries, he finds himself being pulled in by Fujishima.\n\n(Source: DMP)",
