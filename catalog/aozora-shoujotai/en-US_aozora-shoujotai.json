    "sinopse": "Isurugi Takuya has just been assigned a post as ground staff and maintenance for a very neglected air squadron. He's surprised to learn that it was meant to be an all-women aerial acrobatic team! Unfortunately, none of the higher officers have ever really taken it seriously.\n\nIsurugi and the hardworking Haneda Miyuki are determined to rebuild the squadron, and face down opposition to the idea of women as jet pilots! Soon they will add new pilots to their team; the exotic-looking, angry, half-japanese Mitaka Arisa, the gambler Saginomiya Sakura, and the enthusiastic, immature Shimorenjaku Youko, who has a pet vampire bat. Will they be able to prove the value of their team to disbelieving military men?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
