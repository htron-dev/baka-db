## Sinopse

Ritsu is a beautiful waitress working at a café. Being a young and attractive woman, she is incredibly popular among male customers. However, Ritsu only has eyes for one person: Yoshito Kashiwagi, a patron who only visits the café on the second and fourth Tuesday of the month. Suspicious of Yoshito, the coffee shop's manager is strongly opposed to Ritsu's affection for him; not only is Yoshito significantly older, but he also works at the gangster office across the street.

Despite her overflowing fondness for him, Ritsu does not know anything about Yoshito. Yet, there is one thing she is sure about: she is head over heels for him. With only the café to close the distance between her and Yoshito, Ritsu is determined to learn more about the person she admires, no matter how many Tuesdays it takes.
