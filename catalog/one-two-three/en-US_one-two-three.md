## Sinopse

Ever since he was thirteen, Mitsuru Takabayashi has been having indifferent sex with random people as a form of escape. This changes with his meeting of Seita Oogami, who fell in love with Mitsuru at first sight. It's not so easy for Mitsuru, however, because for him everything has to have an order.
