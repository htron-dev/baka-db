    "sinopse": "Long ago, the king of a far-away land made too many enemies by expanding his massive harem. Punished and sealed away in the form of a genie, the lecherous former king can only end his curse by helping 1000 girls find love... and it's not as easy as it sounds! A shy virgin, a hopeless romantic, a sweet younger sister and a nosy older one -- these girls will need all the help they can get! (Source: Go! Comi)",
