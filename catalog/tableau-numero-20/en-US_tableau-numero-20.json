    "sinopse": "Ten years ago, while still a student, Maurice stumbled across an illustration in an artist's sketchbook that instantly captivated him. A drawing of a beautiful youth with sad, gentle eyes, an expression that spoke of love and forgiveness. Now settled into his successful career as an art restoration expert, Maurice is shocked by the sudden appearance of a young man who looks exactly like the one in the drawing. Who, in fact, insists that he is the one in the drawing.\n\n(Source: SuBLime)",
