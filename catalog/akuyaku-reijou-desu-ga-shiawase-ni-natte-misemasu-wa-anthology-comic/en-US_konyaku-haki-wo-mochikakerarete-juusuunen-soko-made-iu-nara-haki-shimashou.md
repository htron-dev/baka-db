## Sinopse

Diana Bailey, the daughter of the Duke, has been sentenced to abandon her engagement many times since she was a child. Diana has been honing herself in response to Prince Robert's request each time, but one day she was told that he would be "relieved and calm" with another woman...!?

A work published in Though I May Be a Villainess, I'll Show You I Can Obtain Happiness! is getting a short-term serialization due to it's popularity! A romantic comedy with Prince Robert's sister, Princess Lizzie, and her fiancé Sergio is about to begin!
