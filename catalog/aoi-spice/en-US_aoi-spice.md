## Sinopse

Ageha wishes what many girls do: to spend her 16th birthday with someone special. Instead, her boyfriend dumps her. To add insult to injury, Ageha later finds herself handcuffed for a day to a two-faced pop idol named Ren. Faced with all these challenges, she wonders if her wish for a lovely 16th birthday will come true.
