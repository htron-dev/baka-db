## Sinopse

Happy-go-lucky Midori may be small in stature, but his upbeat attitude and cheerful disposition make him a shining star who's head-and-shoulders above his co-workers at the plant-rental company! But his biggest, as-yet unrealized dream is to live and work much closer to nature, far from the drudgery of databases and office all-nighters. If Midori gets his wish, will he allow friendship (and maybe even love) to bloom, too?

A Place in the Sun blasts off into dizzying galaxy of first crushes, lifelong friendships and late-night confessions! The men in these sweet stories may fight over silly things like recipes and remembering their chores, but deep within their hearts, they all long to find the single, perfect soul mate who loves them just the way they are! Who will be lucky enough to bask in the warm glow of love's first heady rush?
