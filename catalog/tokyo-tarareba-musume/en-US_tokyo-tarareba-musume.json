    "sinopse": "After 33 years, Rinko Kamata's life has come to a standstill. Her once-successful career as a screenwriter has gone downhill, she spends most of her nights getting drunk at bars, and worst of all, she is still unmarried. While younger girls enjoy their love lives, Rinko and her friends—Kaori Yamakawa and Koyuki Torii—wonder what went wrong with theirs.\n\nOne night, as the three women are drinking at a bar, they come face-to-face with the handsome model, Key, who tells them off for dwelling on \"what if\" scenarios. Drunk and full of spite, Rinko declares that by the time the Tokyo Olympics arrive in six years, she will not be a bachelorette anymore.\n\nTokyo Tarareba Musume follows Rinko and her friends as they struggle to find love as 30-something-year-olds in a city run by the young, the trendy, and the successful.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
