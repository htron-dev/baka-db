## Sinopse

Michi Yomogihara is a petite girl with slender legs and a running pace that leaves motorcycles to shame. After spending most of her life abroad, she returns to Japan to pursue her passion and idol. Upon coming face-to-face with said idol, however, it becomes apparent that things won't go as smoothly as she had hoped.
