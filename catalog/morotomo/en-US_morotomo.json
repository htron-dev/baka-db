    "sinopse": "Collection of short stories:\n\n1. Morotomo (With Thou) (3 chapters)\n\n2. Jingi Nashi! (Without Honor!)\n   Inept yakuza Sekiguchi loves getting arrested, for it's his best chance to get up close and personal with no-nonsense detective Murata. But when Murata warns him about the imminent closure of his gang, Sekiguchi faces an uncertain future. Can a guy who fantasizes about fondling the nipples of macho men in handcuffs ever go straight?\n\n3. Seinaru Otoko (The Holy Man)\n   Pastor Andy, a missionary on a remote island, finds the brawny Taka washed up on the beach. Taka is the exact opposite of him in every way: a tough, brutish lout engaged in drug trafficking. Despite the danger, Andy offers Taka shelter and assistance - but his acts of Christian kindness conceal a dark obsession of his own.\n\n(Source: Half-Baked Scans)",
