## Sinopse

Nagisa, an office worker, ends up (almost) living together with Hiro, a long-distance driver. Food tastes even better than usual with "Aikagi-kun" and his big appetite. The casual time they spend together begins to color their days... A heartwarming story about a thirty-something office worker and a younger man (almost) living together!
