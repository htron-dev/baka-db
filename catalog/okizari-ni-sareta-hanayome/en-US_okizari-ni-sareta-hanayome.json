    "sinopse": "Donned in a gorgeous wedding dress, Kelly awaited Alekos in the brilliant church. However, no matter how long she waited, her charming Greek groom did not show up to walk down the aisle. Just minutes before the ceremony, Kelly had been cruelly abandoned at the altar. Four years after that tearful day, Kelly finally finds the resolve to forget Alekos and move on. On a whim, she decides to sell the diamond engagement ring he gave her through an internet auction. But Kelly has no idea of what's to come. Her ring sells for a grand total of four million dollars. And the one who shows up to claim the ring... is Alekos himself.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
