## Sinopse

An amazing academy, of the Magicians, by the Magicians, for the Magicians.

During the Magician Academy's examination, student Takuto Hasegawa called out Tanarot, a level 5000 mysterious fairy with magic power above 100,000.

Tanarot's appearance not only shakes Takuto's cousin Suzuho and the Academy but the godly and the magical worlds!
