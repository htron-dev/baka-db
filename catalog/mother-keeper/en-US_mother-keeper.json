    "sinopse": "The world is split into two kinds of people: those on the \"inside\" of Eden, and those on the \"outside.\" The \"inside\" Eden contains clean air, clean water and a good way of living, it lives up to it's name of a true paradise, but this Eden couldn't contain all of the people of the world. Those who couldn't be inside the paradise that is the inner Eden has to stay outside the \"inside\" Eden. The conditions in the \"outside\" Eden is the total opposite of that of the \"inside\" Edenâ€”here the land is dry and in the people suffer from poverty caused by the \"inside\" Eden. Because of this, many resistance groups have been formed. Ricalna Forde is a soldier of the resistance team Cosmos, whose mission is to infiltrate Eden's main headquarters and destroy the \"Central CPU\" that controls all of Eden.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
