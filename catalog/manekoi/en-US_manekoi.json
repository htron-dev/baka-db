    "sinopse": "Sonoda Haru is a 16 year old teenager who has a crush on his classmate Honda Chikako, who is not only popular but athletic, smart and incredibly hot whereas Haru is just an average joe. He has been dealing with this feeling for months without making any progress until one day he is forced to purchase a welcoming cat off of a random person on the street. It turns out that as the 10,000th user of the welcoming cat, a real life walking, talking, and breathing welcoming cat named Maneki Nekotaro appears from his world. Nekotaro has come into Haru’s life to grant him any wish and the only thing he has in mind is being with Chikako. But Nekotaro’s expertise is in financial related issues and has no experience in romantic problems so he has to make it up as they go. Will Haru ever be able to be with Chikako?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
