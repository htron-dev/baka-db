She goes on to study at Western Washington University in the U.S., a popular destination for Asian students studying overseas. At the video's end she has attained her dream by consulting on construction of a Japanese-themed shopping mall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ("I'm building a town here that will make people happy!").
