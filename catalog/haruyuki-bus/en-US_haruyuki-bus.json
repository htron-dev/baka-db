    "sinopse": "A boy riding on a bicycle is always observed from the bus at the same time of the day and the same place. One day, a girl happens to meet his gaze. Her eyes met his. Though it is a usual bus running everywhere, it is always carrying different feelings of passengers, such as painful love or one-sided love.\n\n(Source: Lovers-Dream)",
