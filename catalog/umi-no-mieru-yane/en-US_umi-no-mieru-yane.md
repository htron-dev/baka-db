    Kei's grandfather is a well-known architect, and the young boy cherishes every letter from his beloved relative...until the notes suddenly stop. Now, Kei, must visit his grandfather's distant island home and solve the mystery for himself! Upon arriving, he meets the shy and aloof Michiru, a serious student at the school where his grandfather once taught. Michiru may have the answers to Kei's burning questions...but will he cooperate? Can these two young men follow the clues and find their vanished hero?
