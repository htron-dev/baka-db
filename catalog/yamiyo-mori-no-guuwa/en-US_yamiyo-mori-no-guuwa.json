    "sinopse": "\"If 90 out of 100 cases are scientifically explained, the remaining 10 persist as mysteries surpassing human knowledge.\"\n\nWhen a story about the supernatural takes reporter Alyssa Thompson into the Dark Night Forest, she and her co-worker Nick are accosted by strange forces. Are the culprits mere-men, or something more sinister? As Alyssa seeks the truth behind a series of weird and unnatural mysteries, she repeatedly crosses paths with the enigmatic Chevalier Bayard Gran d'Or and his strange young companion, Pineau Rouge.\n\nWill they lead her to the 10 percent of cases that are truly supernatural? And how does Chevalier always know where she is and what her heart secretly desires?\n\n(Source: DMG)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Shiranami Souichirou",
