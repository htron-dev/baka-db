    "sinopse": "Marta is a Portuguese graduate student looking for work in Japan. She lives in an apartment alongside other Japanese girls of her age who she interacts with in a daily matter. Her income is tight (if she has any at all) so she has to resort to using unorthodox methods to make food. Her neighbours consistently help her overcome her daily mishaps.\n\n(Source: MU)",
