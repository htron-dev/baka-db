## Sinopse

"You were the only one I didn't want to find out about this desire…"

10 years have passed since Takuma lost touch with his good friend Yuki, who left for Italy to become a Cellist. Now working as a home aid, Takuma is shocked to find his next patient is none other than Yuki himself. Yuki, who is now semi-blind after an accident left him injured and his eyes trapped behind bandages until his surgery. Due to mixed feelings about their reunion, Takuma keeps his identity a secret as he tends to the injured Yuki. But how will he react when he learns that his friend was in love with someone when they were kids… and still holds a torch for that person even now?

A Cellist who has kept his feelings hidden in the recesses of his heart and his childhood friend…the music of their clumsy yet pure love begins to play…
