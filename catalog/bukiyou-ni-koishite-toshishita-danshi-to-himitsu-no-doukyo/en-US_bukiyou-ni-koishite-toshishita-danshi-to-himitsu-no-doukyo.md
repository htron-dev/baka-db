## Sinopse

Hinayo Otose is a lively, cheerful girl whose slightly flashy appearance brings her a lot of attention from the boys, but also causes misunderstandings. Everyone thinks she's a flirt, but all she wants is to find true love! Enter Yuzuki Kiyohara, a younger guy she meets at work. He seems very serious and reliable for his age, but won't he get swayed by the rumors like all the others...? And when Hinayo finds herself in a bind, it turns out that they have to start living together!
