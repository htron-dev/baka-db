The main character is a corporate company employee suddenly summoned to another world and is asked to fight as a hero. However, he is a disappointment who does not have skills, and he is relieved of his duties as hero.

He was determined to have no skills, but in fact he had a Gift from God, a gift that no one else could ascertain.
