## Sinopse

Minori was attracted by Kitagawa Yougo’s first work, “Fallen Birds” and came all the way from Tokyo to his exhibition in the countryside. Their first meeting ended in a very unexpected way and it seemed that Kitagawa sensei was deeply in love with Minori since a long time ago. How can that be? Will Minori accept Kitagawa sensei?
