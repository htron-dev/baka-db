## Sinopse

Himeji's older brother, Miyaji, meets the new dorm mangaer, Hatoya Sensei. Is Miyaji a pervert just like his brother or does Hatoya Sensei have his own plans. Also, while Naruse and Kunisaki are happily in love, rejected waiter Aono still hasn't found his love. Is there a soul mate out there for Aono and why is that customer SO grumpy every morning? And why does Aono have to cater to him? (Source: Attractive Fascinante)
