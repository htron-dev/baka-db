Their chance encounter in the hallway and then mixing up the mail seems to bring them closer together. But how close is too close?\n\n4-7) Pursuing the Realist\nJade Muto has moved back to Japan after years of living in Italy. Best friend Yuusuke Mikami takes him to lunch, where Atsurou Miyazoe serves them lunch. But Jade wants to be served more than just lunch. With a little help from Yuusuke, will Jade be able to win the heart of Atsurou?\n\nVolume 2:\nTone is back with more ways to satisfy Yuki-chan! And with the new editor-san, do we get to see more this time?\n\nVolume 3:\nV3 continues from the couple we saw at the end of V2, the editor, Takatou, and Yuki-chan's classmate, Dai-chan. \"Do you want to sleep with me?\" A light joke with only a tenth of true intent from Takatou, Dai-chan actually agreed to it. Will Takatou really do it? A cameo of Mikami and Rui in the extra.\n\nVolume 4:\nTone and Yuki-chan are back! With the appearance of our new rival, Heath, will Yuki-chan waver? What would Tone do to take charge of his Yuki-chan? Dai-chan was taking care of the sick Takatou when he gave him aphrodisiac instead of cold tablets. After a night of torturous fun play, Dai-chan got sick instead. What would be the destiny of Takatou when he gave aphrodisiac to Dai-chan out of revenge?\n\n(Source: Attractive Fascinante)",
