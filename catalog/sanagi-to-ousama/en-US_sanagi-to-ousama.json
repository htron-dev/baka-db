At home, things aren't going well with her mother who's a single mom. The only place she feels at peace is at Ageo's rock cafe. There, she meets Yanagi. Yanagi understands the pain she carries deep within her, and she finds herself slowly falling for him. One day, Sekina finds herself face to face with Yanagi again... but this time, he's the substitute teacher for her class...?! (Source: B-U)",
