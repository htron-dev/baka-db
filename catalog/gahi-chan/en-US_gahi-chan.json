    "sinopse": "A youkai disguised in human skin?! Gahi-chan is a Mimic-type monster that can both gain nourishment, and take on the appearance of the illustrations she eats. Having found the discarded works of an amateur mangaka, she becomes addicted to their taste and turns into his greatest fan. She decides to move in with the mangaka, and help him in his day to day life in return for more drawings from him.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
