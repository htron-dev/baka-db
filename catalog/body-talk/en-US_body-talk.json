    "sinopse": "The many oneshots are interesting and as sketchy and rough as they seem, the artwork is actually amazingly precise in Inomoto Rikako's own personal style.\nThe stories are not very complicated and there is an abundance of eroticism. A little too much action and not very developed storylines, some might say. But there's really only so much that can happen in oneshots. (Source: M-U)",
