    "sinopse": "A wildly imaginitive trek into the deepest realms of human beliefs and the mysteries of the universe. Daisuke Igarashi's amazing pen can recreate anything he can imagine on paper, resulting in beautifully chaotic, maddeningly detailed scrawls of pure wonder. A true celebration of the human imagination.\n\nWhen deep emotions come to the head, the witch that dwells in the heart awakens—the gorgeous and literary illusory tales begin.\n\n(Source: Batoto)",
