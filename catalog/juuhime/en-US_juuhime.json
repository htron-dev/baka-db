Unwilling to accept this loss, however, humans discovered a way to seal magic into bullets. They regained their powers... and the world was again plunged into an era of war and chaos.\n\nNow, amid the turmoil, a youth called Cedric, his sister Elwing and their companion Ambrosia set out on a journey to recover the \"Gun Princess,\" a weapon powerful enough to change the destiny of the entire world.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas)",
