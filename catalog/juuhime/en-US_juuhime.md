## Sinopse

Delve into an epic fantasy alongside Ambrosia, Cedric and Elwing as they quest for the ultimate weapon in a magical world ravaged by war!

Long ago, mankind's foolishness angered the gods and they were stripped of their magical abilities. Unwilling to accept this loss, however, humans discovered a way to seal magic into bullets. They regained their powers... and the world was again plunged into an era of war and chaos.

Now, amid the turmoil, a youth called Cedric, his sister Elwing and their companion Ambrosia set out on a journey to recover the "Gun Princess," a weapon powerful enough to change the destiny of the entire world.
