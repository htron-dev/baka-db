## Sinopse

There lived a tiger in the bamboo forest on the top of the mountain. He went by the name of "Tigger". Tigger the tiger was the Tiger of tigers.
He was a lazy fellow always thinking of Nikuman (a dumpling).

Then, there came the Hunter. With a bang, he shot and killed the animals. He thought there were no threat to man in the world.

But he had come to wake to Tigger, the Wild Tiger!
