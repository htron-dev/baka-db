## Sinopse

If everyone’s wishes and desires were fulfilled, would the world be a delightful or fearful place?

As a child, Ozu Hayato was full of dreams, but he’s grown into a high school student with no desires or aspirations. One day, a mysterious man wearing a black suit appears before him and claims he has a hat that can grant people’s wishes.
