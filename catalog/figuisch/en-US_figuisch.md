## Sinopse

Dear ladies, One day I asked a high school friend of mine about her hobbies and she answered "Plastic models." And another high school girl told me she was way into military uniforms. She's so into uniforms that she's even got a German officer's uniform from WW2! Then there was another girl in my class named Hiromi, she picked up this giant larva and said she wanted to be an entomologist when she grows up. I love all you guys! Take care and don't catch a cold. Sincerely yours.
