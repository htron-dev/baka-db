## Sinopse

Marriage with the villainous "Ice Emperor"—despite his harsh words, the voice of his heart is super sweet!? The Princess of the Southern Kingdom, Tistye, who can read people's heart, is married to Gaizel, the King of the Northern Kingdom, which is renowned for its outrageous cruelty.

Contrary to his relentless cold words, she can hear the voice of his heart, which is surprisingly mellow—his gap almost causes her to die of embarrassment!
