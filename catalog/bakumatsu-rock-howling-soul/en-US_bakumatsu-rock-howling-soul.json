    "sinopse": "The Tokugawa shogunate uses the brainwashing \"Heaven's Songs\" by the top idols in Shinsengumi to subjugate the country and its people. In this Japan, writing or singing any songs besides the \"Heaven's Songs\" is a capital offense. Ryouma Sakamoto and the other rockers rise up and change the world with rock 'n' roll for freedom and justice.",
