## Sinopse

What's a guy supposed to do when his crush is part of club that's involved with the supernatural but scared to death of the un-explainable?!

Meet Ipponsugi Kaede, a normal high school student who has had a crush on Akiyama Momiji since the first day of school. He joins the same club as her; All Purpose Chemistry Club to get closer to her. Sounds pretty normal so far right? Well that's where the normal ends. As soon as he joins the club, he's tested by the club's crazy president, only known as "Boss," to see if he has any supernatural capabilities in order to become a full member. To top it all off, Kaede is deathly afraid of ghosts. But a couple of tests shouldn't be much of an obstacle in the pursuit of love, right? Is Kaede's love for Momiji strong enough to endure all the crazy chaos that seems to happen in this club?
