## Sinopse

Tia is a fortune-teller who lost her power. Judged no longer useful and expendable, she was sent to a neighboring country to assassinate their own powerful, beloved fortune-teller. Tia recklessly attacks and is quickly caught by a castle guard, Riisu. Instead of executing her, Tia is assigned to assist Riisu. The girl who had resigned herself to death warms to her new surroundings and starts to enjoy working and feeling needed again.
