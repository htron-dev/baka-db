## Sinopse

From HMR:
Considered better than Hot Blooded Woman by some, the main character is extremely obsessed with the actor Ah-Min. Her uncle bumbles his way into signing a contract that requires her brother to live at Lee Sun-Ah's house for three years. She goes in place of her brother, only to discover that her dream has come true--or is it nightmare?
