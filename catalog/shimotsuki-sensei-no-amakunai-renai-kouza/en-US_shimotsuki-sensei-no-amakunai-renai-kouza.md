## Sinopse

Airi Kurihara is part of the student council. She's an excellent student and has very good grades, but she's very bad when it comes to love. Behind her facade, there's a controlling girl who doesn't know how to become "cute" until a new neighbor enters in her life as her private tutor. Will he teach her to increase marks in love?
