## Sinopse

Harriet, an antique dealer, buys a mountain villa in a village in Southern France to enjoy her summer vacation with her niece. But the mountain villa is an abysmal abandoned house...! And what surprises her more is the fact that the former owner of the mountain villa was her ex-lover, Andre. He was the man who captured her eighteen-year-old heart and sent her into fits of despair. The love and hatred she buried eight years ago comes back to life and tortures her emotions!
