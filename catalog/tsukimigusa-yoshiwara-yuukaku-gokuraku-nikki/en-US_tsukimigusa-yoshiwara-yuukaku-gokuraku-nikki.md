## Sinopse

Set during the time when Japan was Westernizing during the Meiji era. A girl from the countryside with literally nothing to her name is sold to Yoshiwara, which thrived in the Edo period. Will a plain girl be able to survive the world of Yoshiwara, a whirlpool of place of jealousy, lust, and sadness?
