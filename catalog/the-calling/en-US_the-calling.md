## Sinopse

An adaptation of Patricia A. McKillip's "The Forgotten Beasts of Eld."

Sixteen when a baby is brought to her to raise, Sybel has grown up on Eld Mountain. Her only playmates are the creatures of a fantastic menagerie called there by wizardry. Sybel has cared nothing for humans, until the baby awakens emotions previously unknown to her. And when Coren -the man who brought this child- returns, Sybel's world is again turned upside down.
