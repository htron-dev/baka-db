    "sinopse": "This is Hisaya Nakajo's first tankoubon, and it contains 4 one-shot complete stories. The first one takes up most of the volume, while the other 3 are much shorter and finish off the book. The main story, 'Yume Miru Happa,' is about a country girl named Futaba who moves into a building in the city where she gets free rent in exchange for some light cooking and cleaning. She is in the city to go to school, somethings her parents wanted her to do. Futaba quickly becomes entangled in the relationship between Zakuru, the guy who she lives with and is doing the cooking for, and his friend Masato. Masato is very nice to Futaba, but what is his relationship with Zakuru? The next story is about a 17 year old tomboy named Natsume who realizes she has feelings for a childhood friend of hers. But the fact that she has always been a tomboy seems to make up a lot of her worries. The last 2 stories are also great high school romances.\n\n(Source: niko-niko.net)",
