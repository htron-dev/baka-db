## Sinopse

Reputation is everything in a world of icons and popularity contests. So why not score some points here and there by being the nice guy? This is the way Shinghi Kang legitimizes the fake personality he has everyone believing. Armed with his above average looks and a (completely false) angel-like personality, he has every girl in school head over heals, and all the guys looking to him for guidance. With the exception of having a screwed up cross-dressing devil for a dad, Shinghi's life is absolute perfection (_cough_ of lies) until one day, Sung-Hae transfers to his school.

While being a complete martial artist freak, she also likes to fib just a little in front of those who know her… you know, like acting like she's just a scared little girl who'd play with kittens rather than break brick walls with her head~! After all, how can anything go wrong when you're as cute as Sung-Hae?

Fate has brought these two masters of lies together and the two must battle it out to see who will be crowned the undefeated heavy-weight champion of fakeness!
