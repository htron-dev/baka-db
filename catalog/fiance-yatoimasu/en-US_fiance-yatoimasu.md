## Sinopse

In order to stop her family from worrying about her life choices, Julie decided to lie to them about having a fiancé, and she's kept up the lie for the past two years! She was able to get away with it until now by saying her fiancé, an international financier millionaire, was always away on business, but now that her sister was about to get married, she couldn't get out of bringing her fiancé to the wedding. Her only option was to ask a regular at her bakery, a poor, amateur actor, to play the part—he even had the same name as her imaginary fiancé! Julie assumes her plan will run smoothly. How could she know Robert's passionate acting would draw her to him so strongly?
