They decide to date, but it seems like any time they get a chance to be near one another, something ridiculous and unexpected happens! For instance, Koedo tries to give him a first confessional love letter on a day that he is injured and can't see! On the first day they walk home together, Daizu is chased and terrorized by Koedo's own dog! Can they overcome their curse?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
