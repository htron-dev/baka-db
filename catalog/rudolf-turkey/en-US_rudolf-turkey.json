    "sinopse": "Rudolf Turkey is a wealthy, smooth, cigar-smoking man, who also happens to be the acting mayor of the desert city of Gond Land. Gond Land is a place where money is power, and there are many casinos and showgirl clubs. Rudolf gets into his share of questionable situations, such as making a bet out of foiling a bank robbery, or fighting with the mafia over the control of a club with lovely girls. With the help of his surprisingly skillful secretaries (Egumarinu and Momoko), Rudolf usually comes out on top. However, he doesn't seem to be able to get the woman he desires, a lovely woman in the town called Lapan, to fall for him!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
