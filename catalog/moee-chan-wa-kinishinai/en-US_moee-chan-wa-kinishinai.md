## Sinopse

Douden Moee doesn't care much about things. Whether she gets a winning popsicle stick, or a million yen falls right in front of her, or it's just ten seconds before the world ends, for sure her expression would not change, and would always go about with her own pace with composure. And surrounding Moee-chan, unbelievable things have been mysteriously happening!?
