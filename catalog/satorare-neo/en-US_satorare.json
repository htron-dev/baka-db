However, due to their great intelligence, they also lack the ability to keep their thoughts to themselves. Everywhere they go, they unknowingly project everything they are thinking into the minds of everyone in the immediate area. Because the genius of Satorare is vital for the advancement society,and because knowing that everyone can hear what they are thinking may have a disastrous impact on their mental well-being, the rest of the world's citizens must work to pretend that they are unable to hear these thoughts. Government organizations have been created to assist regular citizens in dealing with the presence of a Satorare.",
