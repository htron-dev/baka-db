## Sinopse

Enter the strange world of Imiri Sakabashira in which the denizens are zoomorphic creatures that emerge from one another as well as their equally bizarre environs. Aka Tights Otoko follows its protagonists along a scooter trip through a complex landscape that oscillates between a dense city, a countryside simplified to near abstraction, and hybrids of the two; the theme of hybridity permeates throughout. One is unsurprised to encounter a creature that is half elderly man, half crab or a flying frog in this world where our guide apparent is an anthropomorphic, mollusk-like cat.
