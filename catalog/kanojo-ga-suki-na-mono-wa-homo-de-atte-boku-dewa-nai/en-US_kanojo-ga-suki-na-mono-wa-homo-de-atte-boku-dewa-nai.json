    "sinopse": "Homosexuality is filthy, unnatural, and deplorable—Jun Andou believes this, and yet he spends every day hiding that he is also gay. This hatred for who he is so deeply ingrained into his being that not even his close childhood friend knows the truth. To get by and sate his needs, Jun has resorted to sexual gratification from an older, married man. The only one he can speak openly to is an anonymous man online who goes by the alias \"Mr. Fahrenheit.\" Every day is spent honing his lies, wearing a mask, and hiding his true self.\n\nThat is until he meets Sae Miura, his classmate who also happens to be a closet fujoshi. Although she doesn't know Jun is gay himself, she challenges his belief that homosexuality is dirty, and the two start spending time together. But then, the unthinkable happens: Sae confesses to Jun.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
