## Sinopse

Ark is a boy that has lived his whole life in the secluded underworld village of Crysta. Even though everyone else is content with their lifestyle, Ark's desire is to know what lies beyond.

One day, a voice coming from a secret basement of the elder's house calls for help. Ark, being the only one who heed the call finds Pandora's box, releasing both a curse that freezes the entire village and a strange creature. It is here that Ark's journey to restore his village and the world beyond starts...
