## Sinopse

1. Natsume often goes to see his childhood friend Hisataka, but Hisataka's always mean to him. Being eight years younger, Natsume has always looked up to Hisataka, but those feelings have changed into something more serious. Will Hisataka ever see him as anything but a kid?

2. Kazama is a clumsy but energetic office worker who's secretly in love with his boss Sudou. Knowing he'll never catch the super elite beauty, Kazama is content to watch from the sidelines. But then he accidentally witnesses an unprofessional side to Sudou. Does it mean Kazama has a chance, or is his case more hopeless than ever?

3. Sweet Funny Fighter
   Kouna's not sure when he fell in love with Seto, but he can't stop visiting the convienence store clerk and trying to get a reaction out of the expressionless kid. When he mistakenly sees Seto in a fight, Kouna becomes his confidant. But it would be so easy to take advantage of the lonely boy...

4. I Can't Be Gentle
   Maki's younger lover Junya has time for everyone except Maki. Tired of being left alone, Maki tries to satisfy his desires with toys, but craves a lover's touch. Will Junya come to his senses before Maki finds someone else?

5-6) Takei and Nishina are business partners, and though they're both gay, they never considered each other because they both "top". When Takei's teasing goes too far, he finds himself being pushed down by Nishina! Trying to get back on top is rapidly becoming Takei's ultimate goal.
