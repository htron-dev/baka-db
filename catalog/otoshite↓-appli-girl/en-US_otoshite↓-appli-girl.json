    "sinopse": "Kurose Urumi, an antisocial woman, just became a new teacher. On the first day of her job, she arrives in an empty classroom with a single laptop. Suddenly, a girl materializes out of the laptop, claiming to be her student, and explaining her job as a teacher is to \"download the other students and help them graduate!\" Kurose reluctantly agrees to the task, and slowly finds out that her job may be fun after all.\n\n(Source: Trinity BAKumA)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Obocchama, Goshidou shimasu!
