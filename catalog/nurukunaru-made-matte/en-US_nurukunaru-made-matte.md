## Sinopse

Junpei is in love with his coworker Icchan. So when Icchan’s bath breaks he jumps at the chance to have Icchan stay with him. And luckily this does give them a chance to get closer—Junpei confesses and in no time they’re in a relationship. However, it seems the quiet Icchan is hiding a past slightly more colorful than it initially seemed.
