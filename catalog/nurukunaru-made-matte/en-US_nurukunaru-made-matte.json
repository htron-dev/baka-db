    "sinopse": "Junpei is in love with his coworker Icchan. So when Icchan’s bath breaks he jumps at the chance to have Icchan stay with him. And luckily this does give them a chance to get closer—Junpei confesses and in no time they’re in a relationship. However, it seems the quiet Icchan is hiding a past slightly more colorful than it initially seemed.\n\n(Source: MU)",
