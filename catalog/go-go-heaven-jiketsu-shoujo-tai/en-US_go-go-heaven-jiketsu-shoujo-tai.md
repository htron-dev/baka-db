## Sinopse

Aya, Julia, Michelle, and Himiko don't know each other, but they all have the desire to end their lives. They meet through a site on the internet and decide to organize a rock concert. It will be unique in the sense that they want to die on stage, or at least that's what they plan to do. But will fate decide otherwise?
