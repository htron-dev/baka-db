## Sinopse

The year is 185 AD. The Ancient Roman Empire has been devastated by the tyranny of the 17th Emperor, Commodus, who was dying for combat. Marcia, the emperor's concubine, is worried about the end of Rome and decides to summon a man who harbors the great departed Roman soul, "Virtus" from the future using the secret art of manipulating time.
