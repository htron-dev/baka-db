## Sinopse

"I can't finish you..."

There's a man named Hyeon-dae who has sex and a woman named Min-joo who loves!

32-year-old man Hyeon-dae is a part-time illustration instructor. He looks like he has a normal life but he suffers from his endless sexual desires and emptiness.

27-year-old Min-joo is a traffic reporter. She always greets people with a bright smile everyday but she's smudged with pain and betrayal.

They have been seeing each other for 2 years but Hyeon-dae's marriage ended things. However, they crave each other without realizing it.

They are confusing sex with love and the world is a confusing place.

What do they desire?
