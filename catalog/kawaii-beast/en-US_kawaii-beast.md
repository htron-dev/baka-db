## Sinopse

There’s a tall and mysterious (and scary!) guy named Onizuka in Kisaki’s class. He looks horrifying at first glance, but if you take a good look, he’s actually pretty handsome! And yet he acts like a big lumbering animal all the time. He’s practically a little baby! Now, Kisaki’s starting to feel like he wants to keep Onizuka’s hidden charms to himself… but why?! Don’t miss this love story between Kisaki and his cute beast!
