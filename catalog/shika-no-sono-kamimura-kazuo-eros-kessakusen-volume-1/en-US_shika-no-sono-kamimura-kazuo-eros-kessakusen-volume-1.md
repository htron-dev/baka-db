## Sinopse

Azusa Wakaba, the daughter of Azusa Fumiko, famous film actress, jumps into the film industry with her beauty to find the truth behind her mother's mysterious suicide. Wakaba catches the eye of Murase Takayuki, a man on the verge of a promotion to director, and wins the lead role, but Murase loses his job to his mentor, Makiguchi, a master of the film industry. In a world where lust becomes murderous intent and hatred abounds, Wakaba's starring film is in a world full of hatred.
