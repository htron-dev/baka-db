Wakaba catches the eye of Murase Takayuki, a man on the verge of a promotion to director, and wins the lead role, but Murase loses his job to his mentor, Makiguchi, a master of the film industry. In a world where lust becomes murderous intent and hatred abounds, Wakaba's starring film is in a world full of hatred.\n\n(Source: Soft Magic, translated)",
