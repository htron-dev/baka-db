## Sinopse

Young Kyounosuke has wolf blood running in his veins and a life-changing mission to complete! The "Alpha" in his family is about to die, and his long-lost brother Kokuyou is the rightful heir to the pack's top-dog position. Kyounosuke must hunt high and low throughout the dirty alleyways of Tokyo in order to sniff out his sibling, but there are plenty of people (and other beasts!) who can't wait to stir up trouble for the courageous boy.
