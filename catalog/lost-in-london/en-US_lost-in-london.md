## Sinopse

Mysterious murders have been taking place in town lately and everyone is uneasy. Anne may look like an ordinary teenage girl in plain human’s eyes but she has something unique and exotic that attracts Vampires. May it be her blood type or even something in her skin that makes vampires so attracted to her? No one knows... One thing is for sure, Vampires keep coming in the city she lives in and they are even in her school now! Luckily for her, she has her brother to protect her and also one mysterious new guy...
