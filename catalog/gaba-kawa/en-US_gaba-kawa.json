It's not as easy as it sounds when Rara starts to fall in love with a human. They're not supposed to help mortals and they're definitely not supposed to fall in love with them! But that's just what happens when Rara enters high school, where a hot guy named Retsu Aku calls her \"Gaba Kawa\"! “Rara, don’t forget not let the humans aware that you’re a demon.”",
