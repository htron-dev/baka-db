## Sinopse

Rara, a girl from the demon world, arrives on earth with only one goal in mind: To do as many bad things as possible.To draw humans to the darkness. Sounds easy, doesn’t it? It's not as easy as it sounds when Rara starts to fall in love with a human. They're not supposed to help mortals and they're definitely not supposed to fall in love with them! But that's just what happens when Rara enters high school, where a hot guy named Retsu Aku calls her "Gaba Kawa"! “Rara, don’t forget not let the humans aware that you’re a demon.”
