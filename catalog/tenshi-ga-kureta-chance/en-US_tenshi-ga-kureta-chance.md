## Sinopse

Princess Lucy of the Xavier Kingdom sighs, "Why won't he come and take me away? I've tried calling him and sending letters, but I haven't had any news of him. Was he lying when he told me that he loved me?" Meanwhile, Seth is angry. "Why did she abandon me and go back to her home country? I know the King ordered her to come home, but not contacting me at all since leaving is taking it too far." The love the two of them share is torn apart by the difference in their social statuses and the expectations of their surroundings. But an unexpected chance at reconciliation appears...!
