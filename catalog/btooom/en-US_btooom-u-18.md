## Sinopse

In the future, Btooom has become extremely popular, and the death game is now broadcast across the world. While many people think that it is staged, Kan knows better because his best friend was killed while playing it. Now a popular NewTuber, he vows to reveal the truth by entering the game and livestreaming it to his viewers.
