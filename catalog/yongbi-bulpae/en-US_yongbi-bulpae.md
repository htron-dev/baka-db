## Sinopse

Yongbi is a bounty hunter without fear or reproach. Especially without fear, actually. Despite his greed and his penchant for drinking (fortunately shared by his faithful horse) and women, Yongbi is still a charming young man. And when a boy carrying a medallion, source of much envy, finds himself under the protection of the adventurer, those who cross their path must prepare for the worst!
