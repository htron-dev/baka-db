    "sinopse": "Six months after the world ended, a young man continues to live with his manager at a shopping mall. The rest have left, believing a rumor of salvation if they manage to reach the center.\n\nDuring one of his rounds, he finds the first living person he's seen in a while. The girl, who introduces herself as \"Romero,\" has been roaming not for food, water, or salvation—but rather, for a movie...?! \"Who cares about humanity! The world is already up in flames, so why not just kick back and watch a movie?\" An up-and-coming author's exhilarating debut work! Nothing beats watching a flick during the end of the world!\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)",
