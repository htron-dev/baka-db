## Sinopse

Six months after the world ended, a young man continues to live with his manager at a shopping mall. The rest have left, believing a rumor of salvation if they manage to reach the center.

During one of his rounds, he finds the first living person he's seen in a while. The girl, who introduces herself as "Romero," has been roaming not for food, water, or salvation—but rather, for a movie...?! "Who cares about humanity! The world is already up in flames, so why not just kick back and watch a movie?" An up-and-coming author's exhilarating debut work! Nothing beats watching a flick during the end of the world!
