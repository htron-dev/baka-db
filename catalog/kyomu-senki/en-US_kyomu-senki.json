    "sinopse": "In Confucian Era 14276, a violent showdown unfolds in the space surrounding Planet Lagra. And with that, the story begins. Unfolding on Earth and in far-off galaxies, in the past, the future, and across dimensions, the curtain has risen on the final war between light and darkness. A great, galactic epic spanning the author's career begins here!\n\nKyomu Senki is made up mainly of four series: \"The Tiger of 5000 Light Years\" serialized in 1980-82. \"Kyomu Senshi Miroku\" and \"Jaki-oh Bakuretsu,\" both of which started serialization in 1987, just a few months apart. Lastly, \"Skull Killer Jaki-oh,\" a mech series set in the 20th century that originally started in 1990.\n\nAlong with the four main series, it also includes four short stories: \"New Rashoumon,\" \"Ninja Arts at Honnou Temple: The Black Magic of Koji Kashin,\" \"The Strange Living Dimension, Dogura,\" and \"The Dogura War Chronicles.\"",
