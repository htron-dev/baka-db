## Sinopse

A drugstore that deals in medicine ... and danger! Kazahaya Kudo has a gift. When he touches a person or an object, he sees visions. With no money and no place to stay, Kazahaya was out of luck until fate brought him to the Green Drug pharmacy. Now, in exchange for working in the store, he gets room and board. But in order to make ends meet there's a catch ... he must take on 'special' assignments from his boss that can only be handled by someone with Kazahaya's gift. With the help of his co-worker and roommate Rikuo, who has unusual powers of his own, Kazahaya finds himself on missions most surreal.
