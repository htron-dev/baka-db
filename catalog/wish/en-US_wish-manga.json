    "sinopse": "One night, a man named Shuuichirou Kudou comes across a tiny angel trapped on a tree branch. He frees her, and in return, she offers to grant him a wish. However, Shuuichirou is a successful doctor, with a home and everything he needed; he declined the angel's offer. The persistent angel, named Kohaku, refused to give up, stating that \"some wishes cannot be fulfilled by oneself.\" After settling in at Shuuichirou's home, Kohaku reveals her mission to track down the Angel Master of Wind, Hisui, who has abandoned heaven. That is if her devil rival and his two catty servants would let her leave long enough to do so...\n\n(Source: ANN)",
