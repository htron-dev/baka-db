Two high-school girls share an apartment. Fun-loving Yamada Momo loves to spend any money she gets. Serious (yet cute) Madoka Suzuki scrimps and saves all the time. Madoka is saving her money to visit her grandfather in Germany. And Yamada? She wants to buy a scooter! But in the meantime they have to learn to live together. Can they be frugal, yet happy? Will Yamada ever find space for all her mangas? Will Madoka ever get used to having the toilet and bathtub in the same room?
