## Sinopse

He seduces girls, gets them and then dumps them. He specializes in the one-night-stand. He has no interest in love or romance. Dating someone would be a pain. This terrible guy, Hanada Shintarou, is nevertheless, extremely popular. But then he meets a girl who might just be the one who can change him and his low opinion of women. The only problem is that she despises him!
