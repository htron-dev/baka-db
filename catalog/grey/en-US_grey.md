## Sinopse

Grey is a laconic trooper in a rough, futuristic military system which rewards success in battle with high pay and promotions, but only three percent of troopers live long enough for the final goalâ€”citizenship, and the chance for a life above the misery of most of the populace. Grey has managed to keep coming back alive, even earning the nickname "Grey Death," but is the society he's fought for worth it?
