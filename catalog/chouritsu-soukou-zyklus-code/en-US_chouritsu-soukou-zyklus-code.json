    "sinopse": "Musical instruments have minds and bodies, feelings and thoughts. When tossed aside and abandoned, they can become corrupted, even murderous. Petrauchka is an instrument unlike the others; she can't make music at all. After she's found by the mysterious Rentarou in a trash heap, they must team up to calm a despairing lute and perhaps reveal the secret to Petrauchka's lack of musical ability. Can Rentarou somehow unlock her latent talents?\n\n(Source: Fallen Syndicate)",
