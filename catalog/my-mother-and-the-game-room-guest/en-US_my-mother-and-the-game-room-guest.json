    "sinopse": "This manhwa is a parody of a Korean novel called Sarangbang (Korean room) Guest and My Mother, a story that most Koreans have read. It's a classic piece about a widow and her child. The widow rents a room in her house to a man, but soon after, the man and the widow have feelings for each other. The key thing here is that the story is told through the eyes of the six year-old child.\nIn this parody, the widow is a \"game-junkie\" who runs a game room. One day a very handsome man collapses in the game room.\n\n(Source: MegKF)",
