    "sinopse": "In a gray and empty landscape, a spherical, yellow entity suddenly materializes. Though its plain appearance may not suggest much, its ability to transform is boundless, and it is not hesitant to kill. Nearby, an armed woman awaits this creature, ready to eliminate it. Will she be able to defeat it, or does this being's abilities far outclass her own?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
