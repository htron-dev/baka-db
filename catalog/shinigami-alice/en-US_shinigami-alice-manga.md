## Sinopse

Returning home late in the evening, Kanogawa Masaki is attacked by a murderer! Just in time to save her, a cute doll-like girl with deadly scissors kills the attacker, with the explanation that she is just doing her job. Unfortunately, part of this strange girl's job is also killing any witnesses. For reasons unknown, she allows Masaki to run away. Now Masaki can't stop thinking about her, and about finding a way to see her again...
