    "sinopse": "Ibuki Shirakawa is often described as \"perfect\" due to his looks, charm, and effortless success at all of his endeavors. However, he considers his childhood friend Shion Sawaguchi to be a much better person than himself. Despite Ibuki's high regard for Shion, he is still shocked when an unearthly voice suddenly announces that Shion has been selected as \"God's child\" and will be taken away in seven days. Beginning to float above the ground, Shion grows a pair of wings and is bestowed a halo prior to the voice's disappearance.\n\nWhile Ibuki ponders what to do next, he gains inspiration from a televangelist decrying lust as a deadly sin that even caused an angel to fall from Heaven. Thus, he resolves to defile Shion in order to save him from his fate. Although Shion starts to lose one of his five senses every day, he never loses the sensation of Ibuki taking pleasure from his body. Ibuki has always wanted to become intimate with the man he treasured so much, but when Shion continues to retain his heavenly gifts, he begins to fear that his ulterior motives are precisely the reason this method is failing—or worse, his sinful desires were what led to Shion's plight in the first place.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
