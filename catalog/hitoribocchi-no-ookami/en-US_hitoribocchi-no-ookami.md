## Sinopse

Beth's childhood love had to come to an end, but young Jamie vowed he'd grow up and then he'd come get her. Over ten years later, only half of his promises had been fulfilled. Jamie was a man, a success in Australia, where he grew up to be very powerful. But when a likewise grown-up Beth tries to meet with Jamie, he beds her thinking all the time that she is a just another anonymous gold digger. Traumatized, Beth tries to say goodbye for good, but then Jamie tracks her down and buys her financially troubled family's farm... Just what is Jamie's end game?
