## Sinopse

Meet Youko Yamamoto—a cat-eyed, 15-year-old girl in the late 20th century with a love for videogames and Pocky. Because of her exceptional talent with arcade shooters, she's been recruited by Lawson to travel a thousand years into the future to pilot the prototype ship TA-29. Together with Ayano Elizabeth Hakuhouin, Madoka Midou and Momiji Kagariya, Youko leads the Terran team against Rouge and Ness' infamous Red Snappers in this epic space adventure.
