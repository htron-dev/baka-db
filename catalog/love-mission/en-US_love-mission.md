## Sinopse

Tomoe Karuma is an up-and-coming mangaka whose supervisor is Ero Magazine’s Tanaka Atsuki. Though he imagined a cute girl named Tomoe, Tanaka is surprised to learn that in actual fact, Tomoe is a very geeky boy. Tomoe is a professional when it comes to creating sex scenes, but turns into a fish out of water when it comes to love. Tanaka offers to teach Tomoe all about love, but can the awkward mangaka learn about love in time to write about it?
