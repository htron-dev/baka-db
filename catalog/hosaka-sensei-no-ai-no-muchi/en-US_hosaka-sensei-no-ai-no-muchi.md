## Sinopse

Kawai Karen is a girl with an evil-looking face, who finally achieved her dream of becoming a nursery teacher. Problem is, her face makes the children around her cry on a daily basis. At the same time, there is a handsome man in charge of the same class as her who can seemingly do anything. This Hosaka is also incredibly popular among the children...but he is a little too serious?
