    "sinopse": "Seven days is sufficient for first-year high school student Touji Seryou to determine whether he loves a person or not. He is well-known at school for dating the first person to ask him out on Monday and then breaking up with them by Sunday, telling them he cannot love them back. Even so, girls continue to ask him out because for the one week that they date, Seryou cherishes them with utmost sincerity.\n\nYuzuru Shino is Seryou's handsome senior in the archery club, who is always dumped once his partners discover his unlikable personality. After hearing the rumor about Seryou, Yuzuru meets him by chance at the school gates and asks him out as a joke. To his surprise, Seryou takes his offer seriously. How will things go during their week-long relationship?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
