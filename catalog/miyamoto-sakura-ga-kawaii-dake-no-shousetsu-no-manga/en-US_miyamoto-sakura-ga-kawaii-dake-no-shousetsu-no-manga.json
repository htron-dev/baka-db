    "sinopse": "Sakura Miyamoto is cute. Why, you ask?\n\n1. She looks cute.\n2. The way her expression is constantly changing is cute.\n3. The way she gets so easily excited is cute.\n4. Still remembering the proposal from when we were small is cute.\n5. Her breasts are surprisingly big.\n\n...See, with all this together, how could she be anything but? And so this manga exists to admire her, the purest manga in the world. Incidentally, my name is Hikaru Ogami. I'm Sakura's childhood friend, and I'm apparently the reincarnation of the Norse Deity Odin.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
