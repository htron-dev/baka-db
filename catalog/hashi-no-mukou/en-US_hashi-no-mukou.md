## Sinopse

There are old stories of children disappearing by the river's edge. This has haunted Otoha ever since her friend Jiro disappeared when she was seven years old and now she is back in her hometown covering the war between the government and the dissidents. When she gets separated from the squad, Otoha thinks someone seems to be leading her deeper into the back alleys of the town.
