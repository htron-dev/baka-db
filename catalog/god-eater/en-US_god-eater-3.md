## Sinopse

The opening promotional animation to Bandai Namco's God Eater 3. The game is slated to be released next month for PS4 and the following year for PC. The story is a sequel to God Eater 2 Rage Burst, just like Resonant Ops. There was a disaster of tremendous proportions, referred to as "Ash Area" that devoured Fenrir, and is apparently still ongoing.
