## Sinopse

At first, she might seem just a cute girl, pretty like a doll, but as soon as she opens her mouth, it becomes clear that she's a really shrewd and independent girl! Her name is Koume and she has a "date with destiny!" She meets one very cool "tiger-master" and one very hot "tiger-tamer" and they are both handsome young men… But what is the truth about them?
