## Sinopse

Kanazawa College of Art is scheduled to move to a new campus in 2023.

This work was created by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, an animation director who studied at the College and also a visiting professor, collaborating with 20 students. It is an original story directed by Yonebayashi based on the images and ideas that the students had in mind.
