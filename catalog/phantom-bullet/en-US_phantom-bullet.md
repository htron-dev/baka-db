## Sinopse

At the beginning of the manga Phantom Bullet, a woman in black with a hat (the woman present on the front cover) kills a man to recover a book. Fifteen years later, at the village of Wadowice (Poland, 1944), a young girl sees her mother killed just in front of her by the Nazi. After the villagers buried her mom, the priest of Wadowice (who was present when the woman in black recovered the book 15 years ago) tells her a strange story: the dangerous book seen at the beginning of the manga had been brought to him by two unknown individuals and is now hidden in the chapel. The priest is in fear and doesn't want to use it but the girl runs to the cache, find it, read it and recite some incantations.

A mysterious man appears and after she asks him to help her take revenge of the responsibles of the death of her mother, he makes a dragon appear just behind her. Then, the girl goes find the Nazi unit who killed her mother but as they are all cutted to pieces by the monster, the strange woman in black appears...
