    "sinopse": "Gook Eun-Song is your average high school girl... that is until her attractive younger sister steals the man she had a crush on. Depressed, Eun-Song purchased a bottle of alcohol and crawled into a supposedly cursed closet in her father's furniture store. Yu Ha is your average typical bad boy. He even broke traffic regulations just to end up being chased by a couple of police officers.\n\nOddly enough, he also ended up in the same closet where Eun-Song is asleep from drinking too much. Yu Ha ends up sleeping in the cursed closet with Eun-Song by his side... just to find out the next day, their bodies have been _gasp_ switched!\n\nCan anything else possibly go wrong for our poor heroine?\n\n(Source: RC-SCANS)",
