## Sinopse

In order to repay the huge debts her parents have left her, the high school student Yuri Tsuzura has decided to take up arms and become a mercenary. She becomes part of the Matsukura Team, who will undertake any contract regardless of the risks or legality.

However her first target is... a burger shop in a metropolitan area?

"T-that, isn't that dangerous? That's super dangerous, right?"

For some reason, Yuri's first job is to attack the mascot character of a burger shop! With this mysterious commission, an aberrant night where bullets, blood and laughter are flying around is about to start!
