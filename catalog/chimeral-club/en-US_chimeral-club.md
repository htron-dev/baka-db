## Sinopse

Set in the Daiouyama Prefecture High School, a school with over 3000 students. The Student Council Empress decides that small clubs are a blight on the schools resources, and that they should be forcibly merged into one club. Which of course throws four very different clubs and girls with different interests into the same room...
