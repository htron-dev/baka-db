## Sinopse

Neuro Hard is a story set in the year 2300 when humans are drifting in the mechanized planet Hurema Hiyuto and space exploration is the order of the day. Intelligent lifeforms were detected in the fifth planet and a team of explorers decided to investigate. By mistake, the expedition administrators stupidly brought in a rowdy bunch of space pirates who proceeded to blow up the main ship and crashing them into the strange Planet Anthea. The Planet of the Bees - where a colony of aggressive wasps dominate the land.
