## Sinopse

Shinsaku and his brother are two orphans raised by the Lord Yoshimoto. Their kingdom is at war for a rare and mysterious "Kamui-the stone resource." In each kingdom, some men wear an emblem since birth that gives them a higher power from the gods. Although the brothers do not have it, they hope to lend a hand to the army of their lord.

Only the conflicts between states are constantly repeat, and Shinsaku refuses to accept the horror of this perpetual war.
