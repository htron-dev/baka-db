## Sinopse

Life in hell is like peaceful, ordinary life in some ways. The kids live in a place like a dorm, and they go to school. However, every person that has fallen into hell has some kind of punishment. Etou Juri falls constantly into hopeless love, sometimes even with inanimate objects. Hida Mari is compelled to always eat carrots, which she hates. Andou Natsumi is ridiculously popular, so that even the textbook problems are about him. Soon a newcomer joins them, Nakamura Mikoto, who frequently mangles her words and becomes impossible to understand. The four of them live through their peaceful school life—in hell!
