Kokoro and Haru's first encounter was the worst. Even so, they found out that they are both huge fans of the same band and started walking home together after school.

One day, they meet up with the singer of that band, Kai. Haru is unhappy that Kokoro started crying because of how moved she was. He took her with him and left Kai. However, Kokoro is still excited...!?
