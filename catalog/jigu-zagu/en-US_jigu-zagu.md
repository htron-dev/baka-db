## Sinopse

Fujisawa Kazui followed his recently departed grandfather’s will to stay in Seisou Gakuen’s Tsukigase Dormitory. The cowardly Kazui has two roommates- one is Kawasaki Ryouhei, who has a very big secret (!!) and the other is Mario Bertini, who talks in a strange Japanese accent. With these two as roommates, what kind of a school life would Kazui have?!
