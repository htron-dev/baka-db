## Sinopse

Persistent mediocrity hasn't dissuaded Fukutsu Toshi, captain of a lame high school baseball team, from his love of the game. But when the principal, dissatisfied with their losing performances, threatens to take away their playing field, Toshis is forced into action to turn things around with all out efforts. But facing him at every turn is endless adversity. Nothing is ever easy for him, but luckily, Toshi has the determination to beat it all.
