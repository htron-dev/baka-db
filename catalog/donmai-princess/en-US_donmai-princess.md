## Sinopse

Summary by totochan:
What does a high school boy have to do in order to make the love of his life remember you in _this_ lifetime? Cosplay? Host a "this is your previous life" audition? Show her all your good points? Just because she is a manga otaku in love with Blue-Sama. It's not like falling in love with manga characters is based on real life?
