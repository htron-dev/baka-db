## Sinopse

Haruka Toyama—38 years old, scriptwriter, and recently single. After breaking up with the man who should have been her "last love," her romantic future seems bleak. One day, she sees a special TV report about sharehouses, and decides to start one of her own, for "40-ish" women. She wants somebody to share not only happiness and sadness, but also the "future" with.

Together with 4 other single, "40-ish" women, all full of personality, she begins her new communal lifestyle. Sometimes they clash, and sometimes they help each other.

This is the story of a new bond between 5 single women.
