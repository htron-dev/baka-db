He finds himself wounded and entrusts them with a \"hand\", which is called \"the Hand of Zeus\". It harbors a mysterious power and energy. This hand can create a \"mouth\" that acts like a portal, which they use to escape the correctional room, however having in their possession that \"hand\" is a great danger, since strange beings are after it so they will have to face them.\n\n(Source: MangaDex, edited)",
