    "sinopse": "Considered by Freud one of the greatest novels ever written, and having influenced writers like Kafka and Nietzsche, The Brothers Karamazov (1880) is the magisterial outcome of Dostoevsky's (1821-1881) works.\n\nHere we have the story of wanton Fyodor Karamazov and his sons: Alyosha, the youngest, who lives in a monastery; Ivan, the intellectual and atheist; and Dimitri, military and impulsive. Through this dysfunctional and troubled family, Dostoevsky expresses some of the biggest anxieties of the human soul and the relationship between parents and children.",
