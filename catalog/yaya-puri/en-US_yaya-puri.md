## Sinopse

Yaya-chan lives with her older brother Nanami, her Papa, and her Mama who is an idol pretending to be 15 years younger than she actually is! Mama and Papa are so disorganized that it's up to Nanami to get Yaya ready for her first day of school...

Written in 4-koma style, this is a warm-hearted comedy guaranteed to make you smile.
