## Sinopse

"Acknowledge moving to Eden magical sealing process, please connect the Sophia code" a girl was asked to put the barrier up, and though she had tears sliding down her cheeks. "Shelltis..will we be able to meet again?" A world where humans are ruled by an existence called Yuugenshu. And only by The Priestess' prayers, were humans able to live on the floating continent "Obia Craire". Yumi, the barrier priestess, was waiting for a boy that would protect her, her childhood friend Shelltis. As a heretic, he was expelled from the continent but before he was expelled he promised Yumi that he would definitely come back to her side.

A girl who is personified by understanding the world and a boy who is rejected by it. A story of two conflicting feelings, and a multilayered world of fantasy.
