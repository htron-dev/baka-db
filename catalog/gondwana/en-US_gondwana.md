## Sinopse

To help Poe, the lion cub that Ragi has been raising from going through some drug experiment, Adresia came up with the plan. She and Ragi sneaked into a lab where the time machine are being kept and tried to use a time machine to trasport Poe to Savanna.

By some accident, Adresia got transported to somewhere else 65 million years ago instead. Since then she has been considered a missing person.

Haunted and feel responsible by this incident, Ragi intended to go back in time to find and bring Adresia back. However, with his history after this incident, will he able to do it or not is still a question.

Included one-shot: Academia no Boukensha
