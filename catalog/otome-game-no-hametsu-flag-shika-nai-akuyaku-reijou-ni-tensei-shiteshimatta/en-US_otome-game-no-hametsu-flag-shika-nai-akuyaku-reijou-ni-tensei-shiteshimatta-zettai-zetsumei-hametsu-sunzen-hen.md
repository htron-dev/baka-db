## Sinopse

As the haughty and selfish daughter of a duke, Katarina Claes is partaking in her pastime of bullying commoner classmate Maria Campbell. While at it, she comes to a sudden realization: she is a character of an otome game that she used to play. Even worse, she plays the villainess and is fated to die due to her misdeeds! Nearly an adult, it is a bit too late to change everyone's impressions of her. On the verge of ruin, Katarina resolves to do whatever it takes to fix her image and live to see another day!
