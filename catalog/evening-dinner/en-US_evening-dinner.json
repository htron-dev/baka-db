    "sinopse": "Kyosuke, a college student bound for Tokyo dreaming of a \"Destined Love,\" was called out at a gay bar by Subaru, a guy who was just his type. Under the influence of alcohol, they went straight into a hotel and Kyosuke had sex for the first time. Their physical compatibility was the best however... After that, Kyosuke got irritated with Subaru's attitude and decided never to see him again. But, it turns out they live in the same sharehouse?!\n\n(Source: Frontier Works, translated)",
