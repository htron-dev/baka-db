    "sinopse": "From as long as she could remember, Menjou Kikuko has never found anything to be deeply involved in. Living without a dream or purpose in life, she takes a job as an OL (office lady) only to be fired and dumped by her boyfriend before she turned 30 years old. As an apology, her ex-boyfriend sets her up with a position at a judicial clerking office. But even though she doesn't have a clue what the job entails, Kikuko begins to grow as a person as she tackles various issues in her job.\n\n(Source: Stiletto Heels)",
