## Sinopse

Fifteen-year-old Chacha is a typical teen with an atypical talent: she can communicate with cats. Though her friend Mito thinks this is the coolest ability in the world, Chacha finds her unique skill to be annoying at best and disruptive at worst. Whether she's dealing with countless strays proposing marriage, neighborhood cats offering to help her with tests or waking up to 'presents' on her bed in the night, Chacha's normal school life will be anything but!
