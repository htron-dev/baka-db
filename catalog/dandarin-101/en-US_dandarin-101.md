## Sinopse

Labor Standard Inspectors. They are the men and women who work day and night to protect the rights of workers and employees from malicious employers who ignore the country's labor laws. Rin Danda just recently got transferred to the Geinan Labor Standards Inspection Office. She is extremely serious about her work, and will not stop for anything to bring down the hammer of the law on employers who treat their employees as if they are disposable.
