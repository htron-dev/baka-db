He's lost a bet, lost his job as a bartender, and been saddled with taking care of a nerdy looking customer, Senri, who is passed out drunk. Things only get worse when he and Senri are chased by a giant monster. Luckily, Senri happens to be the reincarnation of Midas, Lord of the Underworld! Will Shiguma be able to survive the new turns his life is taking?\n\n(Source: B.U.)",
