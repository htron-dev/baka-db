    "sinopse": "When Chiharu is asked out by the infamous Akechi-kun, she doesn't know what to do. He is a known player, and couldn't possibly be serious about her! Besides, she only attended this school in the first place because her sempai from middle school goes here and had told her he would wait for her. But when sempai ignored her during the opening ceremony, Chiharu started to consider transferring out of the school. Will Akechi's confession change her mind?",
