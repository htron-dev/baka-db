Located in the medieval capital Aiteria, head chef Nobuyuki Yazawa and friendly waitress Shinobu Senke serve unique menus every day. Aiterian people from all social backgrounds are drawn in, settling down after a hard day of work to enjoy foreign Japanese-style food and drink. Bringing their everyday experiences with them, customers flock to Nobu, where delicious and unique food brings people together.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
