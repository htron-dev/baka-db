## Sinopse

Taabou is on his space patrol. He arrives on an alien planet and has a run-in with the Scorpio Brothers. Luckily he's saved by Poyo, another alien. Poyo is trying to protect a previous plant from them and Taabou decides to help out. They leave the planet and head towards a black hole to worm hole to an aquatic planet with a palace like that in the folktale Urashima Tarou. The dragon god asks Taabou and Poyo to save a princess and so they fly off the the next planet.
