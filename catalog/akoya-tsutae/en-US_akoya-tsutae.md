## Sinopse

When humans first discovered fire, it filled them with fear. As time passed, they mastered fire, and used it to melt iron and forge weapons. This taught them to build their power, make war and rule one another. Follow the journey of Akoya, a young woman protected by a mountain spirit, as she fights for survival in Japan long before the samurai came to rule.
