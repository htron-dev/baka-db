## Sinopse

I lost the memory of your betrayal because I loved you...

Emiliano, her boss, was the most important person in Sienna's life. She'd never felt more loved and dreamed of the day he would propose. Then she learned that he was engaged to a woman from a wealthy family, and her dreams crumbled. Even though he was the one who dumped her, he tried to kiss her one last time, but she pushed him away and ran. She has no memory of what came after. When she comes to later, all she remembers is Emiliano's love for her. Then she learns she's pregnant with his baby...
