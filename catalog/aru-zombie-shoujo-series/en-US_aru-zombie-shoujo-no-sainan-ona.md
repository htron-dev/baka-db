## Sinopse

On a hot summer day, five university students sneak into the library storage to look for some treasure. They find two sets of female antique mummies from Italy around the age of 14–20 years old.

One of the students, Sayaka, rips open the mummy and takes out a stone called "stone of life," which gave the mummies super strength and eternal life. Having stolen their "stone of life," the two mummy girls wake up and become zombies after 100 years in order to get it back in a bloody gruesome way, smashing their heads and eating their flesh for power.

The only way for the students to get out is to somehow find a way to kill the zombie girls. Will they be able to survive?
