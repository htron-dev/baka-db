## Sinopse

It's an epidemic of accidental death! Multiple college students receive odd voicemails from themselves, messages from the future, and all they contain are the screams of their own deaths. A few days later, at the date and time of the message's posting, they die in mysterious accidents, and oddly enough, each have a candy in their mouths.

Note: Dark Horse published One Missed Call and One Missed Call 2 as a single volume.
