## Sinopse

Abandoning money, fame, and honor, the knight Bard embarks on a journey to find his final resting place. Tasting delicious food, admiring the unfamiliar scenery all by himself, his journey to find a place to die quietly begins. What he doesn't know, however, is that this is the beginning of a new adventure for him.
