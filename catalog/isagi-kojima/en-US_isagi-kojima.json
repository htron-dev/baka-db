    "sinopse": "Toda Yuji and Kojima Isagi used to be close friends when they were little, but they drifted apart with the years. Yuji's your typical model student, while Isagi is a problem child. Even though they're almost like strangers now, Yuji keeps dreaming about a traumatic experience he had long ago, where he was saved by Isagi. After a chance encounter at school, they start hanging out with each other again. But one night they both get into serious trouble.\n\n(Source: Storm in Heaven)",
