## Sinopse

When Lizzia Rietberg realized that she reincarnated into an otome game, she resolved to dedicate her all to this next life. Even as a mob character, she was content with being in the background, avoiding the main plot. However, she is dragged into the limelight when she unwittingly catches the eye of Bernhardt "Bern" Eus Brunsmeier, the final villain of the prince's route!

Lizzia and Bern become engaged soon after, spending time together and steadily growing closer. Save for a hint of darkness in Bern's past, all seems well—until Lizzia enters high school and witnesses the main story begin to unfold before her very eyes.

All Lizzia wishes for is to protect those precious to her and save Bern from his own downfall. However, this is no easy task—as the heroine grows closer to the prince, hints begin to arise that Lizzia may not be the only one who knows this is the world of a game...
