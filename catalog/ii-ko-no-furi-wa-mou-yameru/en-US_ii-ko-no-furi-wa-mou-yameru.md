## Sinopse

Souta's peeved that he came second in a college pageant, but it has more to do with just who he lost to: everybody's prince, the handsome, diligent, nice-guy Natsuki. In his frustration, Souta's teasing goes just a little too far, and Natsuki snaps. Any regrets are soon forgotten in the face of pleasure though. Souta ends up underneath Natsuki—inside Natsuki—and neither of them can do anything but chase that sweet release... Except the next morning, Souta discovers that Natsuki took a photo of him in the act. He doesn't want the picture getting around, so he agrees to be Natsuki's (temporary) boyfriend... It seems the prince is actually more of a devil!
