## Sinopse

Chieri has just entered middle school, and her class is full of people who only talk about romance. With a class like that, Chieri couldn't fit in. Fortunately, she met with Sakura and Ichika, who were also having a hard time socializing. Together, they can stay being themselves. But time stops for no one. Slowly, they're starting to change too...
