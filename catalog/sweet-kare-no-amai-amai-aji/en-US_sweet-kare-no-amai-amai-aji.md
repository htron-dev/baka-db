## Sinopse

Odaka Yuushi works as a salesman for a marketing distributor, but secretly, he's obsessed with the delicious pastries offered exclusively as a "special service" by the restaurant at the Royal Fort luxury hotel. When the opportunity arises to approach the hotel about a contract to distribute their sweets, Yuushi jumps at the chance... but just what kind of price will the younger son of the owner demand in return for granting the contract?
