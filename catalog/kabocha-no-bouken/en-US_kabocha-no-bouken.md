## Sinopse

In a verdant countryside resides a diligent young man and Kabocha, his vigorous yet gentle calico cat. Often sleeping in the shade of their house, Kabocha seems to be an ordinary, lazy feline. But when she goes outdoors, she explores everything nature has to offer. Along the way, the curious cat encounters fellow animals, some of whom may act hostile toward her. With each passing season, Kabocha and her adventures become evermore absurd!
