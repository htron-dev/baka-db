## Sinopse

Twenty-five-year-old Daisuke Nomura goes on his first date—and is subsequently rejected because of his crappy apartment. He speaks to a real estate agent about finding a place that is popular with girls, and he lucks out when he is shown the Tawa Mansion, also affectionately known as "Tawaman," which is the home of numerous beautiful women.

The manager of the building Ayaka Tawada makes quite a vivid first impression on Daisuke. When the wind lifts up her skirt, he notices that she isn't wearing any panties! Soon after, Daisuke decides to make Tawaman his new home, and as he spends more time with Ayaka, he begins to develop feelings for her. But with no shortage of women lusting after him, building a relationship with Ayaka could get complicated.
