## Sinopse

Darren Shan's an ordinary schoolboy, until he and his best friend Steve get tickets to the Cirque Du Freak, a bizarre freak show featuring such arcane performers. In the midst of the ghoulish excitement, true terror raises its head when Steve recognizes that one of the performers—Mr Crepsley—is in fact a vampire! That's when the hands of fate changes the lives of them forever!
