## Sinopse

In the olden times, gods existed together with the people. There were six beautiful and noble sibling gods. But one of them went mad and was sealed away. His name was Yamizuki...

The oracle Sirius of the Kajyu Temple, forbidden to taste the fruit of bodily desires, engages in an affair with King Kouen of the Madian Kingdom. Feeling the scorn by the man he loves, Nadeen, the King's guard, he feels ashamed and desperate. When the troops of Yamizuki attack the Kingdom's capital Madeel, the King dies protecting Sirius. Sirius feels helpless and guilty of King Kouen's death. Thus, he seeks power, but by doing so he exposes himself to danger...
