## Sinopse

Misato's parents are the landlords of an apartment where there are some handsome young men, but they are all shut-in and have other problems: Yamada is a narcissist who lives in delusion, Yoshida is a typical otaku who calls a 2D character his wife, Sasaki is a novel writer with lazy attitude and his room is always full of garbage. Misato has to deal with them everyday. Taking care of shut-in handsome men, is it a blessing? Or maybe not...
