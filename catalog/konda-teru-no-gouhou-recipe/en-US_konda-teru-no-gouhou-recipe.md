## Sinopse

The manga centers on gourmet-loving high school student Teru Konda, who is also a newly-minted gangster of the Shimofuriniku yakuza group. He takes inspiration from yakuza life and puts it into his cooking, such as crafting a pasta dish that he associated with a man being tied up with rope.
