## Sinopse

Sung-Yeol has never let anyone into his library. That is, until he meets Yang-Sun, a young, witty book-seller. He sneaks up on Yang-Sun, who accidentally falls asleep, and discovers that Yang-Sun is actually a girl, not a boy.

As a vampire, Sung-Yeol knows how dangerous he is. He tries to stay away from Yang-Sun, but fate somehow manages to bring the two together.

But there's something that's even more dangerous than a vampire that's lurking in the village...
