    "sinopse": "\"You fought twice against my father, Rodias, and once with my brother, Shalk. You lost every battle, but you're still alive\". Tina's voice was a bit ecstatic.\n\nTina, the daughter of the leader from the world's strongest cavalry corps, the Vassamund cavalry, got to meet Du Darkus, an unorthodox hero with the nickname \"The Always Losing General\" in her first time going on the battlefield. This is a fantasy war story following a hero named Du Darkas, his follower Tina, the princess general Sharna, and other attractive characters' way of life in a war torn world that's full of conspiracies.\n\n(Source: Hobby Japan, translated)",
