She refuses to depend on a man to live and sees her own body as a weapon to create herself a place in society. A contract to guarantee her freedom, to fight against this machismo that hinders women. But can one protect oneself from human nature and one's own feelings?\n\n(Source: Editions Kana, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 4: Kita e Kaerou",
