## Sinopse

Japan in the sixties, Sumire, a twenty-year-old woman, works as a saleswoman in a department store. She refuses to depend on a man to live and sees her own body as a weapon to create herself a place in society. A contract to guarantee her freedom, to fight against this machismo that hinders women. But can one protect oneself from human nature and one's own feelings?
