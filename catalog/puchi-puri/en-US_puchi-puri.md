## Sinopse

Rejected and humiliated by the male classmate he liked, Yuuji is having the worst day of his life. The high school student slumps down on a park bench and is approached by a bright-eyed elementary school boy. Atsushi tries to cheer Yuuji up and gives him a little kiss. Yuuji is outraged that his first kiss was taken by some kid and storms off. The next day, Atsushi shows up at Yuuji’s school. He was worried about Yuuji and declares that he'll take responsibility for the stolen kiss. Atsushi tells Yuuji that he wants to protect him after seeing Yuuji look so helpless when he was crying. After hearing such an innocent, earnest declaration, perhaps Yuuji's worst day will turn into the day with his best memory.
