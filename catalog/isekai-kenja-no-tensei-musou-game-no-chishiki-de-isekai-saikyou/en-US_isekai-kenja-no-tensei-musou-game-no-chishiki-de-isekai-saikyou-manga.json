    "sinopse": "A young man unfortunately died in the modern era, he reincarnated in another world under the name \"Eldo,\" which also happened to be a world similar to a VRMMO game that he used to play in his previous life. However, it's a world where he knows the \"basic skills.\" Eldo became a level 1 adventurer, playing as a \"novice,\" but he knows the world better than anyone, and this is because of the \"data he knows.\" Will the reincarnation in this world make him strong?\n\n(Source: Square Enix, translated)",
