## Sinopse

A young man unfortunately died in the modern era, he reincarnated in another world under the name "Eldo," which also happened to be a world similar to a VRMMO game that he used to play in his previous life. However, it's a world where he knows the "basic skills." Eldo became a level 1 adventurer, playing as a "novice," but he knows the world better than anyone, and this is because of the "data he knows." Will the reincarnation in this world make him strong?
