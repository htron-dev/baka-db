    "sinopse": "On her 15th birthday, Kaede Hinase, a young girl who was working as a part-timer, perished in a traffic accident. Upon her death, a self-proclaimed “God” appeared, declaring that Kaede would be brought back to life. However, Kaede’s happiness was short-lived and her soul was thrown into Erika, the villainess of an otome game! In the original game, Erika became a saint candidate alongside the heroine, committed evil deeds over the course of the candidacy, and ultimately faced condemnation. Thus, Kaede decides that she will not get close to the main characters of the game so as to avoid the bad end, but yet?\n\nThis is the long-awaited fantasy story of a villainous daughter who makes every effort to avoid falling into ruin.\n\n(Source: AlphaPolis, translated)",
