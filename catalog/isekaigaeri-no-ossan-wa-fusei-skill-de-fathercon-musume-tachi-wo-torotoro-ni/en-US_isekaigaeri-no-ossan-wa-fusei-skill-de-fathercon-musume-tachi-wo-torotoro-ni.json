    "sinopse": "He was summoned to another world in the spring at the age of fifteen years old, and when he successfully defeated The Demon King, he was already thirty-two years old. He had finished his role in another world and returned to Japan, but the reality that had been waiting for him was the label of \"middle school graduate with a seventeen year blank period.\" He couldn't find a decent job, and had no choice but to spend his days working part-time. It was then that a beautiful girl who claimed to be a \"completion bonus\" appeared before Nakamoto. \"I'm the reward for the Hero who defeated the Demon King,\" said Angelica, a girl who came from another world who persistently continued to tempt Nakamoto to make her his wife. Together with a high school girl who looks like Elsa, his beloved girl that he lost in another world, Nakamoto with his cheat skills got caught in a harem life.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
