    "sinopse": "In the world of Noramimi, families frequently have \"mascots.\" Funny characters that live with the family and acts as companions to the children until they grow older. Noramimi is one such mascot. Unfortunately for him, he's of an ogre (well everyone else thinks he's a monk) type and not popular, so he's doing his \"home stay\" with Hello Kids, an agency that sets up mascots with families. He really wishes a family would adopt him though...\n\n(Source: MangaScreener)",
