    "sinopse": "Kirari Tsukishima is a beautiful yet gluttonous 14-year-old girl. While those around her are worshiping the popular idol duo, SHIPS, she only devotes herself to food. One day, however, Kirari, who is dense when it comes to the matters of the heart, encounters Seiji Hiwatari of SHIPS and falls in love with him at first sight. In order to be with him, she aspires to become an idol herself. With the help of SHIPS—the gentle Seiji and the bad-mouth Hiroto Kazama—and her cat mascot Naa-san, Kirari pursues the entertainment world, where she discovers that being an idol is not all fun and games, and that in order to persevere in both her love and her career, she must overcome any challenges that fortune has in store.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
