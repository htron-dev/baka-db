## Sinopse

At Hananomiya Private High School, the Student Council holds ultimate authority. Mizuki is their President and successfully rehabilitates the infamous former problem child Hakaze and the two start dating. Meanwhile, the Vice President's pet project, Takanashi A.K.A. rehabilitation member number two, blossoms into a new romance. What's with all this love?! That is the question on Yuuichi Noda's, Student Council Secretary, mind as of late. Unable to understand the new love in the air, Yuuchi complains to the Student Council's Treasurer, the stoic genius sophomore, Hiroki Matsunaga. As Yuuichi's best and only friend, he offers that they jump on the love train together and see what the hype is all about.
