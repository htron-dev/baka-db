## Sinopse

Hananomiya's student council president Taisei Mizuki has his hands full with rehabilitating Sousuke Hakaze, the school's number one problem child. As Hakaze's acts grow worse, Mizuki can't take it and blurts out, "how can we get you back to how you were before!?" In response, Hakaze says he'll show Mizuki how...by kissing him (!) and even jerking him off (!!) Can Mizuki, pure in both mind and body, even stand a chance of enduring the naughty chain of "rehabilitation activities" they've just started?
