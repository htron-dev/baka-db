## Sinopse

Sekiya never really had a problem with his kyuudo club team mates. Until one day he overhears fellow club mate Nagashima saying that he doesn't approve of Sekiya. Aggravated by it, neither of them can concentrate on archery practice, and so the cheerful club president Tatsumi-senpai tells them to become friends by holding hands on their way from school every day.
