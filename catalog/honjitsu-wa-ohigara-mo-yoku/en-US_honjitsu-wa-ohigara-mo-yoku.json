    "sinopse": "Asakura Kai has come to the marriage ceremony of the man he once loved. By his side is his former highschool classmate and now sex friend, Iguchi Keisuke. Kai, who was nursing feelings which had no place to go at the time, was offered a relationship which was convenient for both of them by Keisuke. Ten years have passed, with Kai unable to ask Keisuke about his true feelings. \"What are Keisuke's feelings, standing by my side right now...?\" Touched by his kindness, Kai has fallen for Keisuke over the years, but he also can't bring himself to break off the comfortable relationship they have now. \"In the never-stopping flow of time, I experience the end and beginning of love, with you.\" A sensitive story of overflowing desires.\n\n(Source: Cosmic Shuppan, translated)",
