    "sinopse": "Hitomi is a pokémon ranger: someone who uses wild pokémon to achieve their goals rather than capturing them. While pokémon rangers don't need balls to capture pokémon, they do use a tool called a slider in order to get closer to the wild pokémon. Two years after her graduation from the ranger academy, she joins a team with a top ranger. This ranger uses a rare type of slider called a Vatonage slider, which is only available to top rangers. Just what kind of skills does this top ranger have, and more importantly, how exactly does the Vatonage slide work?\n\n(Source: MU)",
