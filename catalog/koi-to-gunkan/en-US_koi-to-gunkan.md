## Sinopse

Endou Kana is a middle school girl secretly in love with a man 28 years her senior, the town's handsome mayor. However, he has a suspicious relationship with an older, scruffy, smoking ero-mangaka. The two men wear the same cologne, have matching bathrobes, and they even regularly stay overnight together…?! So what form will love take? The love of a middle school girl for an older man or adult love? And is it really okay to let Nishi Keiko run rampant in Nakayoshi like this?
