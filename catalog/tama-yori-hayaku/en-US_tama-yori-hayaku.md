## Sinopse

Nakajima Hayato, a 23-year old new hire of a highly selective elite group of officers from the Tokyo police department, has just arrived at a smaller Kanagawa police branch to fulfill a 9 month training requirement. He is partnered with Kashitani Akihiko, an older officer who rose to the same rank as Hayato, but through hard work and experience in the field. With nearly opposite backgrounds and opposite personalities, how will these two be able to solve the numerous cases that will confront them?
