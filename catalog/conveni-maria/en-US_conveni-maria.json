    "sinopse": "Maria is a sweet country girl who goes to Tokyo to honor a favor for her late grandmother. Waiting for her at her destination—the Rosy Convenience Store in Masakigaoka—are the Tomekichi brothers, struggling with an increasingly senile grandfather, a clueless father, and a family business on the verge of bankruptcy. All seems hopeless, until Maria turns up on their doorstep, to the dismay of one brother in particular. To complicate matters, there are moody customers, ever-present food issues, and a shady inspector ready to strike at any moment.\n\nWill Maria be able to save this little convenience store? Or is it doomed to fold?\n\nA fun story that deals with life, love and lunch, Conveni Maria will make you feel warm inside, and maybe even a bit hungry!\n\n(Source: Netcomics)",
