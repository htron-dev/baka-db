## Sinopse

Olivia looks for her sister at the hometown airport she left behind fifteen years ago only to find the last person she wanted to see—her ex-husband, Joel, whom she'd divorced when they were both too young, poor and proud for commitment. Now that they're both adults, Olivia can't help but notice what an attractive and mature man he's become...and she's filled with regret. On top of that, the two are unable to rekindle their love because of a secret from their past...
