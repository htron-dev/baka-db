## Sinopse

Delice Fahrenheit, who'd been transported from another world and has been widely-known for being a prominent wizard, has an apprentice who'd also been transported from another world named Haruna Katsuragi. Her status was unprecedentedly low despite being from another world. However, through her training with Delice, her hidden talents were revealed.
