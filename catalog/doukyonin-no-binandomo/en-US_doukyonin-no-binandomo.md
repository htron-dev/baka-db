## Sinopse

Tomoki has transferred to the local university so he can finally live with his older brother again but Kazuki-nii is always so busy with work that they hardly get to see each other. Actually, Tomoki sees more of his brother's roommates than Kazuki, handsome kind Nonomura and bad boy Ugajin, both of whom want to get to know Tomoki better. So when Kazuki gets sent abroad for work it seems the foxes will be guarding this cute little chicken coop...
