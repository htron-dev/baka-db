## Sinopse

In the midst of the desert there's an oasis city called Afdal, ruled by the Raun family. A young foreigner named Johan finds himself friendless and pennyless in this city, only to be picked up by the head of the Raun family, Asad, as a servant. And after being tormented for his foreign looks, he finds himself in the position of personal servant for the seemingly unfriendly Asad.
