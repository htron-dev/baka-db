## Sinopse

"That cool face of yours... I want to mess it all up," Ritsuki told Sumire at the gym. A game between the school's most popular boy, Ritsuki, and a friend has begun. The game was to win the heart of Sumire, who was rumored to be the biggest slut in school. As Ritsuki becomes closer to Sumire, he starts to see Sumire's true colors. A bittersweet love story of 2 people with broken hearts.
