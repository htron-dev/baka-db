## Sinopse

Nothing could be more important to a woman than having the perfect wedding day. From the ceremony, to the decorations, to the dress everything has to be perfect. As such it's the dream of every girl in Japan to wear Frost Sugar gowns during their wedding day. Frost Sugar gowns have the reputation of being the most beautiful gowns in the fashion world.

But what's this? Controversy? It seems like Frost Sugar gowns are not giving its customers their happily ever after...and its affecting Frost Sugar's reputation. How do we resolve this? Maybe if Frost Sugar's founder were to get married herself...
