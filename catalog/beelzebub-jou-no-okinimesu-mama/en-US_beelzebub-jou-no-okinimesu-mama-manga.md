## Sinopse

Cute, adorable, and fluff-loving aren't words used to describe a demon, much less Beelzebub, the revered right hand of Satan. Nonetheless, Beelzebub is a beauty who loves anything and everything fluffy—her dream is to become fluff itself.

The terrible Beelzebub rules over Pandemonium in Satan's absence. Oversleeping, lazing around, and getting distracted by fur balls, she provokes reactions from her guards and entourage who think of her as an elegant, merciless, and meticulous leader.

Her new assistant, Myurin is caught amidst it all. Looking forward to working alongside his idol, he is the subject of her innocent and carefree teasing, his heart relentlessly being played with. But what exactly is Myurin to Beelzebub, and what place does he hold in her heart?
