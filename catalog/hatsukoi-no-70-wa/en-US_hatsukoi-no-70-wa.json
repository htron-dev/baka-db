    "sinopse": "Kasukabe is a popular ladies’ man who can do almost anything adequately. He takes an interest in Sugiyama of the track team, who spends his every hour running on the school grounds. Eventually, Kasukabe starts to fantasize about Sugiyama. Although he would like to get to know him, Kasukabe can’t find a way to talk to him. But one day, by chance, they find themselves both on the festival committee. This is Hiko Yamanaka’s debut manga with a collection of frustrating love stories featuring boys in high school!
