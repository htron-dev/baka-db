## Sinopse

Every night Sarah sings at a nightclub under the stage name Sabine. But Sarah dreams of being an opera singer. Though she isn't enamored with the scandalous outfits she has to wear or dealing with the club's wealthy clientele, Sarah sings as Sabine in exchange for operatic rehearsal time at the venue. Despite her general disinterest in the club's clients, she is taken with Bastiaan, a Greek businessman who shows up backstage at her performance one day. She knows he can only be interested in the persona of Sabine and not the real Sarah, but her heart beats faster all the same.
