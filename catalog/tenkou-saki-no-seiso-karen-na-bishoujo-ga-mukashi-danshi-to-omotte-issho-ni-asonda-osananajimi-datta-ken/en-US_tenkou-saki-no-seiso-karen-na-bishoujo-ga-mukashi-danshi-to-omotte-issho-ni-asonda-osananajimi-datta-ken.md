## Sinopse

I met my childhood friend again, and she had become a beautiful and innocent girl.

"It's been a while, Hayato."
"Haruki, is it?"

In the past, I used to play in the mud with my childhood friend in the countryside, and when I saw him again, there was no trace of the bratty young man I thought he was back then. Only in front of Hayato, she threw away the coat she was wearing and reacted in the same crass way she did back then. The distance between you and me has not changed.
