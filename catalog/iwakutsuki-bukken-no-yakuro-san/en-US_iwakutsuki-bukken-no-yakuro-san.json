    "sinopse": "Nineteen-year-old university student Yuuki Reikan moves into an allegedly haunted apartment, and sure enough, a female ghost reveals herself with the intent of scaring him away. However, Reikan is not the ordinary tenant the ghost expects him to be, and dating a ghost is something Reikan has always dreamed of, so he has no intention of leaving! The shy ghost is given the name \"Yakuro-san\" and is lovingly pursued by the eccentric Reikan, who unnerves her more than she frightens him.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
