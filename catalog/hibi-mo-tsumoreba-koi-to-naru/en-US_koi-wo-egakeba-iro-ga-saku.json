    "sinopse": "Ryuuji, who had just been dumped by his girlfriend, meets his classmate, Reo, at a drinking party. He becomes curious about Reo who's been constantly staring at him and even sends him home when he eventually gets too drunk.\n\n\"Why did you quit soccer?\" Reo asks before passing out when they arrive at his place. It was a tone that made Ryuuji feel like Reo knew him back in middle school.\n\n(Source: Shueisha, translated)",
