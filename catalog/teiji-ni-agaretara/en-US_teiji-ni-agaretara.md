## Sinopse

The woman she's interested in carries around the scent of vanilla. They would always communicate through exchanging pieces of notes that would be placed inside their coats' pockets. "When the weather turns warmer, will everything end?" The quiet and cute Yukawa-san and the beautiful lady Mizuki-san, where will their love go?
