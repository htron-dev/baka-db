## Sinopse

Kugaya is a teenager who lives with his aunt, Sakuri. The kendo coach at his high school, Narugami, has been after him to join the kendo team; but when he meets the new girl, Takemi, his life takes a supernatural turn and he is thrust into an epic battle with the demonic "intruders." Reincarnation, long buried memories, a Holy Sword, and an entire clan of the swordsmen... It's all too much for a high school student to bear! (Source: Media Blasters)
