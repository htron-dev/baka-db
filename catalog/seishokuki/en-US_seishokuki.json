    "sinopse": "Nogawa Izumi is a good student, and a class representative, but she has an increasingly high libido. It's gotten to the point that she'll claim to feel bad during class, so she can run to the nurse's office and masturbate. When she learns that the Earth is being invaded by aliens that look like people dressed up as animals, it turns out her high sex drive may be able to help protect the Earth. The first time Izumi is attacked by the aliens, she is rescued by Usayama, a bunny alien whose race was their previous victim. Usayama gives her an outfit (a sexy swimsuit) that will allow her to fight the aliens, but which also sends her constant arousal through the roof. The scientific organization that Usayama is affiliated with think that Izumi, with her high erotic level, may be the person they've been looking for to fight the aliens. Will Izumi be able to save the Earth?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
