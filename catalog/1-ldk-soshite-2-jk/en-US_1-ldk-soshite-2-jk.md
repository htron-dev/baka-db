## Sinopse

"Umm... long time no see, sir."
(...Are you kidding me?)

Komamura, a bachelor salaryman, has been entrusted to take care of his cousin, Kanon, a high school gyaru. Just as he was wrapping his head around the sudden change in his life as he went on with his work...

"Can I stay with you overnight?"
"Hey, I really think it’s better for you to head back home..."
"That's the last thing I would ever want to do."
(......)

Himari, a runaway high school girl who was at a loss in the city, also forcibly came to stay with him.

"Kazu-nii, Himari. I made sukiyaki tonight."
"Komamura-san, I-I'll be washing your back...!"
"Just go to bed already!"

Their abrupt cohabitation that came out of nowhere. A heartwarming home love comedy that's spun from living with two high school girls.
