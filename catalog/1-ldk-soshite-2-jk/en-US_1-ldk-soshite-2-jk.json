    "sinopse": "\"Umm... long time no see, sir.\"\n(...Are you kidding me?)\n\nKomamura, a bachelor salaryman, has been entrusted to take care of his cousin, Kanon, a high school gyaru. Just as he was wrapping his head around the sudden change in his life as he went on with his work...\n\n\"Can I stay with you overnight?\"\n\"Hey, I really think it’s better for you to head back home...\"\n\"That's the last thing I would ever want to do.\"\n(......)\n\nHimari, a runaway high school girl who was at a loss in the city, also forcibly came to stay with him.\n\n\"Kazu-nii, Himari. I made sukiyaki tonight.\"\n\"Komamura-san, I-I'll be washing your back...!\"\n\"Just go to bed already!\"\n\nTheir abrupt cohabitation that came out of nowhere. A heartwarming home love comedy that's spun from living with two high school girls.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
