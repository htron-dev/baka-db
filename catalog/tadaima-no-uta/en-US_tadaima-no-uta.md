## Sinopse

Six years ago, Hanadera Himawari tragically lost her parents to a car accident, leaving her and her four brothers to fend for themselves. Now a high school student, Himawari leads a busy life attending classes, rushing off to grocery bargain sales, and doing housework, while her two older brothers work several jobs just to make ends meet. Life is not easy, but as long as she has her crazy but kind-hearted brothers, Himawari will survive!
