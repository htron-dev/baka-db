## Sinopse

Yuuki Momozono, a transfer student coming to Aitan Private School, has an incredible power—he is actually the reincarnation of a Japanese hero, Momotarou. He must break the curse that was set upon him by 7 devils in his previous life, a curse that will bring misfortune to him and his friends, and kill him on his 18th birthday unless he kills the 7 devils before then. Three guardians with super powers and masks showed up to protect Yuuki, but how far can Yuuki live before his time is up?
