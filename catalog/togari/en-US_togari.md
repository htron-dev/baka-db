## Sinopse

Tobei, a ruthless punk from feudal Japan, has been damned to hell for the past 300 years. Given a chance for redemption, he's sent to the modern world to vanquish 108 malevolent spirits in 108 days. Will the baffling ways of the present prove to be an even greater foe than the sinister fiends he must defeat? Tobei is about to go medieval on the 21st century!
