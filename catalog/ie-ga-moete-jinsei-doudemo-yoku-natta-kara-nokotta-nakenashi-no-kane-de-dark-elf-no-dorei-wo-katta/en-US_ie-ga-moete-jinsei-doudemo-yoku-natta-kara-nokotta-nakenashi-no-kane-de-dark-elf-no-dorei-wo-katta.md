He lost his new home and all his property, but found a cute girl!

Harold, a poor laborer who saved for years, finally obtained the house of his dreams, only to lose it to a fire the very same day. Feeling like nothing mattered anymore, Harold finds himself at an auction, where he ends up spending all of his savings on a slave, Atie...
