    "sinopse": "Shiro and Ken are childhood friends. Ever since Shiro was little he would attract spirits and other supernatural stuff. Ken, also known as Tonoko, would protect him from these odd creatures. One day a strange, ghost-like girl named Hime appears, but it turns out she might not be a ghost after all? Strange things keep on coming, like body parts getting switched around! Shiro finds out that Tonoko cross-dresses and works as a host in order to help pay the bills! Hime’s really weird and scary older brother shows up! And they still have to figure out Hime’s past!\n\n(Source: LuffyNoTomo)",
