## Sinopse

Kouta Shirashi is both handsome and smart. As the prince of the school, there should be no girl who can resist his charms, even if it's the cool beauty Kaori Kurokawa. But what happens when it turns out Kurokawa is even better at playing a prince than he is? Just who exactly is supposed to be falling for whom??
