## Sinopse

On a certain morning, a metabolic 35-year-old salary man was suddenly transported to another world.

Without any knowledge about this world and the ability to communicate, and not very confident about his physical capabilities, he just has no idea what to do. However, using the skills granted to him from the existence known as the interface, he sets his goal for the time being as to figure out how to keep living, and just not die.

Hero? Demon King? He knows nothing about that. He's just a salaryman.
