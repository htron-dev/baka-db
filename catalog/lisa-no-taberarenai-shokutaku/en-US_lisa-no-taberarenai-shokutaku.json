    "sinopse": "\"I can't eat anything but delicious food. It must taste delicious.\" Young Lady Lisa is working hard, doing her best making delicious meals. And so, the Young Lady serves her dishes with great confidence. Those who taste her cooking, however, say it's... \"terrible?!\" It tastes bad, much to her dismay! Lisa doesn't actually try her own cooking. Rather, she doesn't even eat the food she makes...?! But one day, after she meets a boy who's fallen on the side of the road, she finally gets serious! Many characters, each with their own distinct circumstances, provide their unique flavor to this unusual cooking tale.\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)",
