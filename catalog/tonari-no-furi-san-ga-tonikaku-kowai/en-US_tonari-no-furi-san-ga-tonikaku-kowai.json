    "sinopse": "Youko Furi definitely looks like a delinquent: she's got a tough-girl image that wouldn't be out of place in a gang. When Taira Namito finds himself sitting next to her in his high school class, he's immediately afraid of her. But as it turns out, Furi's rough-and-tumble exterior hides a wholesome, totally cute person underneath–and she's got the hots for Taira. (Not that he has any idea, of course.) One misunderstanding leads to another in this romantic comedy about a clueless dude and the adorable, slightly terrifying affections of the tough girl by his side!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
