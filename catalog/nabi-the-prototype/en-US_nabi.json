    "sinopse": "The series begins as a guest visits a temple where Myo-Un and Ryu-Sang are living along with many other orphan children. This guest turns out to be an assassin who came to kill a certain someone who is the last child of a powerful family in Su country. The assassin's employer, who remains anonymous, wants to clean up every root of possible problems.\n\nThe assassin calls for reinforcements and attacks the lady of the temple, revealing that the lady of the temple is also another last descendent of another powerful family that was drawn out of Su country. Myo-Un, Ryu-Sang, and others are forced to flee the temple.\n\nThus, Myo-Un & Ryu-Sang's journey begins, and the assassin is still after them.\n\nReaders, at this point, are challenged to figure out who might be \"the last child\". It's either Myo-Un or Ryu-Sang, and even at volume 5 (which is the latest volume at the time of this article), readers will still not likely know who is \"the last child\" that the assassin is after.\n\nThere are three major protagonists in this manhwa. As you may have guessed, the two are Myo-Un and Ryu-Sang. The third is the assassin whose name is Harim.\n\n(Source: JanimeS)",
