## Sinopse

In ancient times, minds and spirits dwelled in all the materials on earth. At the end of a battle these minds dwelling in matter conquered the hostile matter of the enemy and mutiplied. Sacred wars gave birth to the elementalors. Fierce battles between the elementalors raged continuously in the struggle to create a new utopia.

Kagura is an elementalor reincarnated in the present. After a billion nights, the battles of the elementalors have returned... but only one can rule. Kagura's long, fiery trial is about to begin. Now!
