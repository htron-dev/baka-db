## Sinopse

The Kingdom of Landa, once a proud nation, is weakened by internal espionage and strife with its neighbors. In order to restore balance, Linth Highwind Belc Landa IV, Crown Prince of Landa, returns to his country determined to bring about change. But missing from his plans is a man -- the one man who had left behind the intrigue of the palace for the freedom of the sea. So, Prince Linth boards General Sei's ship under the guise of a new ensign, but, when he gets a moment alone with Landa's legendary hero, he finds himself at the man's mercy.

How far will Linth go to bring Sei home? Can a battle weary soldier become a guardian angel? (Source: DramaQueen)
