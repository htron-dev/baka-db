    "sinopse": "Mashiro Shimazaki is a 23-year-old college student and he's got the worst luck in the world. He gets mistaken for a groper on the train, a girl asks him out thinking he's someone else... He just can't catch a break. He even ends up stepping on a frighteningly-beautiful \"incubus\" on his way home...! The incubus—calling himself Nijou—uses unworldly powers to draw Mashiro into seductive pleasures to quench his \"hunger.\" Nijou's tongue drains Mashiro of his strength and he touches Mashiro in places he's never been touched before... With this arrogant incubus and Mr. Unlucky shacking up together, let the pleasures begin!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
