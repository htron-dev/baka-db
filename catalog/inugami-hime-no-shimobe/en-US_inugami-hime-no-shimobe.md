## Sinopse

Inuzuka Taroumaru is a first year high school student who looks like a delinquent. One evening, while he's at his part-time job, he ends up with a white-feathered arrow through his head! He's told that this arrow means he has been chosen as the sacrifice for "Inugami-hime," who lives on top of the nearby mountain. However, this mysterious "Inugami-hime" turns out to be a cute girl who has chosen him to be her servant, not her sacrifice. Their life together is just beginning!
