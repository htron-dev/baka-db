## Sinopse

An all-color 4-koma gag comic featuring the daily life of a newly-wedded couple, referred only as husband ("otto") and wife ("yome") a year into their marriage. The eponymous "hopeless wife" in the title is described as such not because she is bad at housecleaning or other so-called "wifely duties" but because most of the gags in the comic derive their humor from how hopelessly and madly in love she is with her husband.
