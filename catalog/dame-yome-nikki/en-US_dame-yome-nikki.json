    "sinopse": "An all-color 4-koma gag comic featuring the daily life of a newly-wedded couple, referred only as husband (\"otto\") and wife (\"yome\") a year into their marriage. The eponymous \"hopeless wife\" in the title is described as such not because she is bad at housecleaning or other so-called \"wifely duties\" but because most of the gags in the comic derive their humor from how hopelessly and madly in love she is with her husband.",
