    "sinopse": "This is the story of Kunika, a high school girl who is one of three inseparable friends (the other two being shy and cute Yuki, and aloof and tough Ryoko) Kunika is very outgoing around her friends, though she can get overdramatic at times. In the beginning of the series, she is lamenting over the fact that she does not have a boyfriend. She really wants one, and even has a particular guy in mind.\n\nHis name is Gouto-kun, a classmate of theirs. He is really cute, and Kunika has a major crush on him. She likes to fantasize about what it would be like if they were together. But how does Gouto-kun feel? Kunika is surprised when he confesses his love, but it doesnâ€™t go how she planned!\n(Source: http://shoujo-manga.com)",
