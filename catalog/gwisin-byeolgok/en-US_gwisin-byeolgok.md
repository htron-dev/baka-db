## Sinopse

When Ah-ryoung was only a baby, her mother made a pact with a demon named Nachal, who would claim Ah-ryoung's body once she turns 15. Ah-ryoung has inherited her mother's considerable spiritual powers, but that "gift" that allows her to see ghosts even from an early age, has made her an outcast from the other kids. She has finally turned 15, and it's now time for the demon to claim her body... but then an accident happens...
