## Sinopse

In nineteenth-century England, Connie lived in penury while raising her four siblings. But she ultimately pushes herself too far, to the point she that falls ill. Luke, a young farm owner, saves her and hires her to work for him, but his demeanor toward her becomes colder as time passes. One day, Luke's mother collapses due to heart disease and Connie becomes responsible for nursing her. Luke and Connie often converse, sharing news about his mother's health, and Connie finds herself in love with him. But their fragile bond is about to be put to the test...
