After witnessing brothers Ichirou and Gou in an incestuous embrace, Ryuusei questions his own desire to monopolize Ichirou's affections. Much hilarity and angst ensues as numerous revelations assault their relationship. Will Ryuusei's rebelliousness and jealous acts win out against Ichirou's attempts to over-protect him with lies and obfuscation?\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Gentle Green",
