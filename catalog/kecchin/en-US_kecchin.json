    "sinopse": "Shu, Yu, and Mako have been friends since they were little, but after middle school graduation they begin to drift apart. Shu has become the rough kid of the three, with his motorbike, cigarettes and porn. He's going to follow his brother into carpentry. Yu is the smart kid, and he's developed a crush on Mako. He and she attempt to enter the same high school--one below his mental abilities, but unfortunately above hers. After Mako fails the entrance exam, she goes to another school and works part-time as a waitress.\n\nNow Yu is going to high school alone, but he soon makes friends with a pretty girl who encourages his newly-discovered tentative interest in motorcycles. Will Shu, Yu, and Mako be able to keep their friendship alive, despite the different paths their lives have taken? What will happen with Yu's crush on Mako, now that he's growing closer to another girl?\n\n(Source: MU)",
