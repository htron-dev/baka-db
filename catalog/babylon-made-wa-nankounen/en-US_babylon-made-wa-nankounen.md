## Sinopse

It can be pretty lonely being the only member of your species—just ask "Bub", an amnesic Earthling who woke up in outer space and discovered that Earth had been destroyed. As he travels through multiple universes, Bub must figure out his past, what happened to his home planet, and how to best pick up alien chicks—the human race won't repopulate itself, after all!
