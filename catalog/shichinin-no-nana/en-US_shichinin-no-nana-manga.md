## Sinopse

The fiasco started one ordinary night when Nana Suzuki, a typically shy teenage girl, allowed the light of the full moon to fall upon a mysterious crystal and split her into seven different versions of herself. How could anyone keep them straight? You won't believe the story of how Dynamic Nana, Sexy Nana, Crybaby Nana, Smart Nana, Easygoing Nana, and Mean Nana fit into the everyday life of the original Nana. Different though they may be, each Nana shares one common trait: they all have a huge crush on the same guy, Yuuichi!
