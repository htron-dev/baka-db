## Sinopse

Shigeta, a young woman of 24, spends her days working at Tanaka Books and fretting over her love-life or, more accurately, the lack thereof. The thing is, though, the biggest obstacle between Shigeta and a satisfying relationship seems to be Shigeta herself. When it comes to men, the poor girl has exceedingly poor judgement, exacerbated by her even poorer self-esteem.
