## Sinopse

23-year-old Ryohei Yamazaki has just one thing on his mind: sex. And with his sweet-talking, honey-voiced ways, Ryohei has no trouble finding interested ladies. But none of them is just what he wants... none of them is PERFECT. Then he charms the beautiful editor of a hot magazine into hiring him. Journalism will never be the same again...
