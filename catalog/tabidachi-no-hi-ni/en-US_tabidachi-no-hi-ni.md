## Sinopse

An educational film about family issues surrounding a wedding. Typical wedding tropes seen in various media are displayed realistically here. Such as the lack of respect a mother-in-law gives her soon to be daughter-in-law, monetary stress between the two families, stereotyping the other family and thinking poorly of them, and other self-centered ideas.
