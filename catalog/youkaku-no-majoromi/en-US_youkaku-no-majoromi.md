## Sinopse

Only sheep, her, and I are still awake in this world... It's a decadent romantic created by a genius!

One day, all of humanity fell asleep. The only ones who are still awake are me and my cheeky junior Sawada, who became a witch. In a deteriorating world where everyone has fallen asleep, the curtain opens on the romantic comedy of two people.
