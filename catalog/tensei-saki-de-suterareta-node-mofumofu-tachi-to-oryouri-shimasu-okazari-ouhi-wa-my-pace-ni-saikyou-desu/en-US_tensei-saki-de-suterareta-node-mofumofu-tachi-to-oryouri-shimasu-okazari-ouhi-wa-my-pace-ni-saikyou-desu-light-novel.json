Finding herself expelled from the kingdom, Laetitia agrees to marry Glenreed, the Silver Wolf King—a man famous for his hatred of women while ironically seeking a queen for political purposes. Laetitia's new life lets her spend her days cooking and pursuing her hobbies in the royal villa, all while surrounded by furry creatures like wolves, Gardener Cats, and other mythical beasts. One day, after Laetitia offers food to a beautiful silver wolf that appears in the villa, she finds Glenreed's attitude toward her slowly begins to change...\n\nSay hello to this evil aristocrat and her life of leisure, cooking, and fuzzy companions!\n\n(Source: Cross Infinite World)",
