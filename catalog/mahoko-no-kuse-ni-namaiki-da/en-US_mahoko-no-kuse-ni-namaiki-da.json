    "sinopse": "Mahoko and Chise have known each other since they were born. They were next door neighbors, the best of friends, and spent a lot of time together, and gradually, Mahoko developed feelings for Chise. But when Mahoko confesses to him, Chise makes a shocking confession of his own: he tells her that he likes men.\n\nAs the years pass by, Mahoko's friendship with Chise remains strong, despite his self-centered ways. But one day, during an argument with Chise, he grabs her and steals her first kiss, leaving Mahoko bewildered and questioning everything she knows about her childhood friend.\n\nJikuu Enren\nAzusa Katsuragi oftens dreams of when a boy in her high school confessed his love to her. She loved him too, but she never told him, and graduated without ever seeing him again.\n\nFive years later, Azusa's workplace is getting a new employee: Souta Nakatsuka, the very same person who confessed to her. But even stranger still, when she leaves work during lunch, she finds another man who looks exactly like the Souta from high school, and who is also using the same name! Who are these two men, and more importantly, which one holds the key to Azusa's heart?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
