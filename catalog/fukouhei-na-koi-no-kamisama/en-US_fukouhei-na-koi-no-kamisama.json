    "sinopse": "Decima Ross, unmarried at twenty-seven, has resigned herself to the life of a spinster. Her height and spindly figure have made finding a match difficult. Then, in the middle of a snowstorm, she meets Adam Grantham, Viscount Weston. The two are snowed in for days in a hunting lodge, alone but for two servants who are laid up in bed. Although they bond while caring for their servants and the house, Decima parts with no plans to see Adam again. Adam searches for her, but is stopped by his own engagement. The path to love is filled with twists and turns and mismatched partners, but fate will always try to set things right.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
