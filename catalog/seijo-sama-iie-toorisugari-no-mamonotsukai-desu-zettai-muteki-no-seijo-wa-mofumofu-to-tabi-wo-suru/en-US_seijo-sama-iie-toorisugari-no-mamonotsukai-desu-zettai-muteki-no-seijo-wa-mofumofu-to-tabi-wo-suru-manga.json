    "sinopse": "Kanata has always loved animals, however they've always feared her. In her young mind, she made a resolution. If getting close to animals was impossible, then all she had to do was become a monster tamer. Then, she'd finally be able to pet them to her heart's content. She worked with all her might to become one in the future... to the point it would be considered overkill.\n\nThe story of Kanata, 15 years old, as she becomes the strongest monster tamer while traveling together with her fluffy companions.\n\nDemon Lord Zaphgiel (Zakkun) ←Bonded!\nDivine Wolf Fenrir (Fenfen) ←Bonded!\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
