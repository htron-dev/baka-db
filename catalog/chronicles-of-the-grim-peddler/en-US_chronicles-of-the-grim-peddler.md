## Sinopse

The Grim Peddler waltzes through fairly tales, giving the stories' inhabitants their hearts' desires. But benefactors beware, for his gifts don't always turn out quite as expected! Classic fables like Sleeping Beauty, Hansel and Gretel, The Frog Prince and more are turned on their side.
