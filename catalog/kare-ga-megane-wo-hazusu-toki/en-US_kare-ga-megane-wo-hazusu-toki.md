## Sinopse

"Could I take the place of my brother?" When Tomoe's best friend Ichita develops an interest in the new transfer student, it affects Tomoe. Not knowing the reason for this, his feelings stagnate in a corner of his heart. In the wake of all that, he becomes close with Ichita's younger brother, Kenji. The two of them start meeting up together, but one day, on top of pointing out Tomoe's feelings for Ichita, Kenji also confesses his own feelings. It's a story full of waves and waves of emotions and angsty youth.
