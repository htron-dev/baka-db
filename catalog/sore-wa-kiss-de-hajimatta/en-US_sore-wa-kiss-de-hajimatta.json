    "sinopse": "It was certainly the case for Luke Cunningham. The American tycoon had seen Angelica Lonsdale in a crowded street and followed her, mesmerized by her long blonde hair. He would stop at nothing until he had her!\n\nBut Angelica had more pressing problems than dealing with infatuated millionaires--however gorgeous. To save her family home she needed nothing short of a miracle.\n\nLuke Cunningham didn't consider himself hero material, but if the only way he could get Angelica into his bed was by assuming the role of a knight in shining armor ...he was quite prepared to dust off his shield! He had an ideal solution to her problem and his--marriage! She'd get to keep her home, he'd get the woman he wanted right where he wanted her! But lust wasn't any basis for matrimony... was it?\n\n(Source: MU)",
