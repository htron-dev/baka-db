## Sinopse

Saotome Amane is in her second year of high school, and again she's happily skipping school! She loves her internet, games, and anime—your run-of-the-mill shut-in. But she's different to the average NEET, being a 16-year-old schoolgirl makes her superior! ...At least that's what she thinks.
