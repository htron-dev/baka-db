## Sinopse

Saito Hikaru wants to travel overseas more than anything, too bad he can't pass the exam that would qualify him for it. Then he trips over the handsome foreigner Leo in a park and takes him home. Leo acts like a young master, but Hikaru can't resist his sweetness. Did Hikaru let a wolf in his house? And who is Leo, really?
