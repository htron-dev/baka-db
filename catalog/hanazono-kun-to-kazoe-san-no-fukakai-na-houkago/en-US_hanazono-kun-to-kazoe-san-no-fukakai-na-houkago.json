    "sinopse": "Coming from a very conservative family, Akane Kazoe has very limited sexual knowledge. Although she may have gotten the highest marks in the entrance exam, Akane is completely clueless when it comes to anything remotely perverse. This is the complete opposite for Suguru Hanazono, whose house is a sex shop owned by his parents. From a young age, Suguru has been taught sexual knowledge by his parents to ensure that he has proper relationships in the future. To satisfy her curiosity, Akane turns to Suguru one day to learn everything sexual, starting with the male reproductive organ. From this day onward, Suguru starts teaching Akane, developing her sexual knowledge bit by bit.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
