## Sinopse

Wakaba was confessed by her classmate, Yuu and they started going out. "Is that love?" she thought while she wanted to answer to Yuu's feelings. "Can I be attracted by someone I wasn't interested to?"

And then, Yuu's brother, Izumi, tried to kiss Wakaba...?! The brother of her boyfriend! Even if she tries to avoid him she wants to be touch by him...
