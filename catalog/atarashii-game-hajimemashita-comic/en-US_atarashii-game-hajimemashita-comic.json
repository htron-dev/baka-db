    "sinopse": "The main protagonist, who progresses through the game while enjoying it at his own pace, will be recognized as the strongest. Instead of progressing through the main story at a typical pace, he would rather take the shortest path to conquer everything. The protagonist, without actually trying to become liked, gains popularity from NPC men, women and inhumane beings alike. Even among the serious moments that may appear, while everything is just one step from being destroyed by the protagonist, the game will continue to progress as a carefree paradise.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
