## Sinopse

14-year-old Rin Amami is a gifted dancer who has been forced to give up his dream of becoming a singer like his mom because of his deep, frog-like voice. A chance encounter with the idol singing group Beatmen, however, gives him the opportunity to bring his old dream to life.

Despite its oddness, his voice possesses a certain charisma: a captivating power, recognized by some as the legendary "Dragon Voice." Rin's destiny becomes intertwined with the Beatmen, Shino, Goh, Toshi, and Yuhgo, as the smalltime idol agency RedShoes attempts to take them to the top!
