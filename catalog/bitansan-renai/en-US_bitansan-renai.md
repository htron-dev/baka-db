## Sinopse

There's a guy that's been on my mind - Michinaga. One day he told me, "Take, I have a crush on the teacher." But it hurts me to see his pained expression. Forget about that teacher. Forget about that love that'll never bloom. Choose me instead... Taka and Michi, Michi and the teacher, the teacher and Taka's older brother... Where will all their one-sided feelings take them?
