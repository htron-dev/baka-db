## Sinopse

The story takes place in the Dark Ages of Europe in the 16th century. Except rather than just dealing with the plague, we've got monsters, witches and other things that people have to worry about.

The ministry in Europe can't have this continue, so they decide to get help from special boys living in Japan. These kids are the avatars of deities born upon the present era to destroy the devil.
