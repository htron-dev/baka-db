## Sinopse

Collection of the mangaka's BL works from 1994 to 1996.

1. Kept Youth: A boy, infatuated with his school's doctor, follows him home one day... and finds out that the doctor has been keeping a "pet" in his bed. Who is the boy being kept? But more importantly, why does he look so much like the protagonist?

2. Dedicated Body: Dr. Shibusawa decides that his young son Keiri should get an early start in the medical field if he's going to inherit his clinic, so he introduces Keiri to the fascinating world of dissection, despite his wife's disapproval. Keiri gains a taste for dissection, Shibusawa suffers his strained marriage, and his wife discovers what's really up with her husband and his constantly snickering assistant in this odd little story.

3. Dark Honey, Youth
