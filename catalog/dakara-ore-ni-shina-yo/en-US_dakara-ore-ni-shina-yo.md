## Sinopse

Hina has just moved back to her old hometown, and transfers to the local school, North High. Little does she know about the rivalry between the gangs of North High and its opponent South High (the high school which her childhood friend, Kanata, attends). During her first week there, she is captured by gang leader Shuugo and finds out about the "Princess Game," in which she will play a key role.
