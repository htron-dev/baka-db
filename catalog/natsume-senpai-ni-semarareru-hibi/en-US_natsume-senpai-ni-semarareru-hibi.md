## Sinopse

Kaho Hibi is a first year high school student with a love for the muscular. Spending her days admiring the muscles of club members has become her routine—until she meets the muscular prince, Natsume senpai of the basketball club. Those biceps! Those abs! Kaho has fallen head over heels again. And when Natsume asks her to be the basketball club manager, her muscular-filled days start!
