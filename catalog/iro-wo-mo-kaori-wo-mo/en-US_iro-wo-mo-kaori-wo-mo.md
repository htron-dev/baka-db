## Sinopse

Amano Kaguya, a blind incense maker, is approached by Igarashi Jin, a hotel manager, to create some complex combinational incenses for his hotel. Unfortunately, as fate would have it, he finds out that Jin is also the son of the man responsible for the deaths of his parents and his blindness. To make matters even more complicated, Kaguya recognizes Jin's scent as the boy he fell in love with during childhood. Under the strong assault of Jin's male scent, the confused Kaguya can't seem to resist Jin's forceful advances. Will Kaguya lose both his heart and body this time?
