## Sinopse

Dalia maintains the image of a cool and aloof university student, hiding that he is actually quite sensitive about his appearance, particularly his gangly limbs. Contrary to expectations, he has a major crush on his neighbor, Ruby, whose rippling muscles would put any bodybuilder to shame. Dalia can't help but admire her heroic and earnest attitude, not to mention her attractive body!

Tonari no Kinniku Joshi follows the comedic, everyday life of a tsundere boy trying to catch the eye of his cool and muscular neighbor.
