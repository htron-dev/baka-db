## Sinopse

On that day, suddenly, every single male virgin over the age of 18 started dying rapidly, causing a huge panic across Japan! Sex industry prices skyrocket overnight, forming angry mobs of terrified virgins, and the government knows not how to handle such an unprecedented crisis.

Enter our protagonist, 17-year old virgin Eiri Kurumi. He has to get laid before his 18th birthday, or he'll die! He hurriedly confesses to girls, only to be shot down without any hope. Is there any way for him to graduate from virginity?! What will the virgins do when death is staring them in the face?!
