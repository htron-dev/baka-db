## Sinopse

The series is about an orphan girl named Midori, whom is taken in (enslaved) by a traveling freak show. The freak show includes such unsavory characters as a mummyman, a snake woman, and a drooling man with no limbs. The owner of the freak show, the eponymous Mr. Arashi, is a strict man who allows his freaks very little freedom or joy in life. He is especially cruel to Midori. Midori works, not as a freak since she is normal, but as a sort of caretaker of the freaks.
