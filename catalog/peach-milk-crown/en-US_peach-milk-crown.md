## Sinopse

Team Captain Yoichi Kouda is a high school track athlete "specializing" in 200m distance running. He has neither the speed for short distance, nor the stamina for long distance. And other events are out of the question because he has no agility whatsoever. What he does have is determination to train longer and harder than anyone else.

On a team with a celebrated history but has declined in recent years, he is surrounded by teammates more talented but less motivated than he is, and he finds it harder and harder to motivate himself to improve, until the "cool beauty," Momo Tange walks into the picture, capturing the attention of the entire school, as well as Yoichi's heart.
