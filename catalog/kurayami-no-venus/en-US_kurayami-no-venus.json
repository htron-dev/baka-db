She'd lost her parents when she was young, and when she was still a child, her aunt and uncle decided to murder her for the insurance money. Fortunately, a beautiful man saved her life, promising her that she was not alone, that she had him. The man shared his name with a legendary vampire from the area, and when she grew up, Rachel decided she would seek out the enigmatic man who'd saved her life.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
