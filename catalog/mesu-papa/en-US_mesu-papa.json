    "sinopse": "Minato's father is androgynously beautiful. But unfortunately, his beauty outranks his IQ. Not only that, his flashy sense of fashion also makes him look like a flamboyant member of a local host club. Nevertheless, his fatherly love for his only son knows no bound! And today, he is going to annoy his son energetically to no end, yet again.\n\n(Source: Libre, translated)",
