    "sinopse": "In order to fit in at school, Yano Shiki adopts various personas to please the people he interacts with. One day, while he is at his desk, classmate Minase Akiha—a beautiful new transfer student—comments on the book he is reading. This particular book does not suit his character, so he begins making up excuses to conceal his true tastes, when Akiha suddenly dashes out of the room.\n\nThe following day, Yano observes Akiha acting noticeably different. After he confronts her, she reveals that she suffers from a split personality disorder, a case similar—but not identical—to himself. Declaring themselves comrades, the two decide to support each other until the day comes when they can reveal their true selves.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
