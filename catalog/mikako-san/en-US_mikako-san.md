## Sinopse

The future, romance, everything is "undecided," yet the remaining days of high school seem as if they'll be over in the blink of an eye. Mikako Ichimura, 17 years old. Midorikawa, the strange guy who now sits next to her after a seating change and oddly prefers red pencils. At first, Mikako didn't think much of it, but after learning that they both love the same band, their relationship begins to change bit by bit...

The day to day life of a 17 year girl woven together in a soft literary style.
