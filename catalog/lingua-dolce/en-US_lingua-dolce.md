## Sinopse

He's unfriendly and uncouth, yet his kisses are as sweet as his desserts... Neither body nor soul can resist this Italian beauty... Keito is a chef at the privately managed Italian restaurant "Molte Stelle." He's been asked to supervise a new hire, the Italian dessert specialist Gino. Gino's an inscrutable man of few words, and Keito is constantly at his wit's end trying to settle him in. One day, Gino leaps on him and steals a rich, syrupy kiss...!
