## Sinopse

Renowned actor Park Star has portrayed numerous roles on television, but he is best known as Kang Chan in the "Sweet" series. With an enormous interest in Twitter, Star creates a character bot—an account that role-plays a person or character.

Meanwhile, Kim Fanboy, a theater actor at Cheomji University, loves to linger on Twitter. After finally finding a character bot that portrays his favorite character, Kang Chan, Fanboy is ecstatic. However, with the account's affectionate yet in-character lines and greetings, Fanboy thinks the account is too surreal. On top of that, the user sends an unreleased photo of Star, causing Fanboy's heart to race even more. But little does he know, the person behind all these acts is actually Star himself!
