    "sinopse": "Even if the rest of the world is slow to get on board, the girls in these stories aren’t wrong: they’re special and they know it. Whether they’re making point cards for their love hotel clients or studying curses at trade school, they’ll do whatever it takes to make their own way forward.\n\nFrom a magician who runs a small business seeking blessings from the universe to a cooler-than-thou high schooler who learns the pleasures of sex after a random encounter in the adult side of the video store, these women are in control of their desires, and those desires just happen to include each other. An unflinching look at modern women's sexuality.\n\n(Source: The Beguiling)",
