## Sinopse

University employee Ryouichirou is ordered by the Chairman to take in an exchange student.

That exchange student, Qaltaqa, is a native from a developing country who can't understand Japanese!! Though he is a warrior of his tribe and a man of great beauty, seeing him afraid of the phone and the TV, and even the toilet, Ryouichirou gets fed up...

But while being called "Ryouichirou" in such a clumsy manner, he has a change of heart!?
