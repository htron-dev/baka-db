    "sinopse": "This piece of art was written by Yoshimi Uchida who quit writing in many years ago and rumor tells she’s been turning down the offers for reprint.\n\nHugh is haunted by a dream of a strange Victorian house that he doesn't remember ever seeing in life. This dream, while not at all unpleasant, is becoming more vivid every time he enters it. His close friends, affluent Vladimir and clothes designer Vi, are concerned for his well-being, and they reach out to their wider circle of acquaintances in an effort to make sense of Hugh's predicament before it is too late.",
