    "sinopse": "Little did Nao Kogure realize back in middle school that when she left an umbrella and a box of bandages in the rain for injured delinquent Taiga Onise that she would meet him again in high school. Nao wants nothing to do with the gruff and frightening Taiga, but he suddenly presents her with a huge bouquet of flowers and asks her to date himâ€”with marriage in mind! Is Taiga really so scary, or is he a sweetheart in disguise?\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 8: Sugar",
