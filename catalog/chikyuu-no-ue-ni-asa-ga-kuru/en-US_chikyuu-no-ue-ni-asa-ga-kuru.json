    "sinopse": "In order to finish his first drama script, Kiyama Sei has been assigned an overseer—Hinatsu Shunya. But beneath their quibbling lies a little bit of romantic history.\n\nMisunderstandings, broken trust, and unresolved feelings abound as Kiyama and Hinatsu attempt to deliver high drama both on television and between each other. What happened five years ago that is the cause of Hinatsu’s distrust? Are Kiyama’s kind words really true? Can Kiyama’s budding career—or his reignited relationship— survive some new challenges?\n\n(Source: DMG)",
