## Sinopse

Super genius inventor Shizuka, also known as the walking National Treasure, fell in love at first sight with Hajime-kun when she was 10 years old. She hasn't stopped pursuing him for 6 years! Every day, she worked hard to invent something that will get Hajime-kun to fall in love with her. Then, she created a love potion. However, Shizuka mistakenly drinks the potion, and falls in love at first sight with another man!! Is this what they call divine retribution? (Source: Manga Abyss)
