Radioactive contamination and massive explosions become the least of the squad's concerns when the facility suddenly goes into complete lockdown—and they aren't the only ones inside. Now they're hearing voices, rescuing schoolgirls who shouldn't be there, and finding corpses that had nothing to do with the meltdown!\n\nWill Watase be able to save the other survivors before it's too late? Or will the voices make them turn on each other first?! Find out in this fast-paced survival thriller!\n\n(Source: Cross Infinite World)",
