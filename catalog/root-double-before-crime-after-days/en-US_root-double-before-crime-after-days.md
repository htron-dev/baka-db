## Sinopse

When disaster strikes an isolated research city, Captain Watase Kasasagi is deployed with his elite rescue squad to handle an underground nuclear reactor meltdown.

Yet the disaster is not entirely what it seems. Radioactive contamination and massive explosions become the least of the squad's concerns when the facility suddenly goes into complete lockdown—and they aren't the only ones inside. Now they're hearing voices, rescuing schoolgirls who shouldn't be there, and finding corpses that had nothing to do with the meltdown!

Will Watase be able to save the other survivors before it's too late? Or will the voices make them turn on each other first?! Find out in this fast-paced survival thriller!
