## Sinopse

Older brother, Ikusa, is great at fighting, but is better at housework. Younger brother, Mikado, harbors feelings for his older brother. But Mikado can't get his feelings through with a direct attack, so he uses Ikusa's weakness, alcohol, to get his way...!!! Even cousins Riki and Miyako and little sister, Konomi-chan, get sucked into the craziness of this erotic comic series.
