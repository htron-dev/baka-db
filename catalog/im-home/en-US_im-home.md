## Sinopse

The hero, nearly killed by carbon monoxide poisoning while on a solo assignment in another city, loses his memory and can no longer recognize his own family. Unconsciously, his feet carry him to the homes of his former lover, his parents, old friends. As he journeys, he follows the threads of their memories to find out what kind of person he used to be. The clear story line and design draw readers into this powerful work.
