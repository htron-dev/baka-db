    "sinopse": "\"Morgan's coming home!\" her stepfather cried\n\nThose three words should have released a flood of warm memories for Leigh. Instead, thoughts of their last disastrous encounter blotted out the rest.\n\nJust when she'd been coming to terms with her awakening feelings, Morgan had seemed intent on resisting the passion that flowed between them.\n\n\"Why must it be you of all women who tempts me almost beyond endurance?\" he'd said. Why couldn't he see that she was nothing like her mother? And why was the thought of seeing him again casting her world into turmoil...?\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
