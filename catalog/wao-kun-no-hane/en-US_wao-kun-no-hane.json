    "sinopse": "An educational film about childhood bullying. The goal is to teach children that it's okay to speak up and say \"stop it\" and \"I don't like it\" and to tell adults if they are getting bullied. Sometimes the person doesn't realize they are a bully because they might see it as rough housing. By conveying your feelings, everyone can get along.",
