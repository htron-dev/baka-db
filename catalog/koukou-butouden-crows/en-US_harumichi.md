## Sinopse

After graduating from Suzuran, Uematsu Fujisuke is pretty satisfied with hanging out in his little village and being the resident "tough guy." But the second toughest guy, called Suguru, is not satisfied at all. After being beat up by some blond outsider, he decides he wants to head to Tokyo to chase his dreams of becoming a musician. Fujisuke wants to hunt down and beat this new contender, but Suguru just wants to be left alone and finally be allowed to leave this lifestyle.
