    "sinopse": "\"Yes, that\"s the point. You will be beautiful girls yet also boys!\"\n\"Chairman, your Japanese is too weird!\"\nBecause of a big misunderstanding, I—Yamada Shinri (a 15 year-old male)— end up attending a girls-only school. And that mistake wasn't limited to myself, as the kendo idiot Yuki and the androphobe Sakura are two other boys who for some reason will be female high school students with me!? And there that unparalleled secret is proclaimed.\n\"For the sake of the mixed education, don't toy with the girls.\" is what the chairman said, but what does that mean?\nFurthermore, Sakura... You claim to be a boy like us, yet in truth you are―!?\n\n(Source: LNDB)",
