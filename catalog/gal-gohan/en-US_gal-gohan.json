    "sinopse": "Home Economics Teacher, Shinji Yabe, is asked by the biggest gal in school, Miku Okazaki, to help her \"bake cookies to give to the teachers.\" The principal told her to do this, after she flunked every subject and makeup-class they put her in. He gets her to successfully finish a batch of cookies after several mishaps and is touched by his students glee over her success.\n\nHe decides to start a cooking club after this experience to get more time and connection with his students. Upon hearing this, Miku decides to join, since he was the first teacher that didn't shove her into makeup-lessons after her failings and pushed her to try harder instead.\n\n(Source: MU)",
