    "sinopse": "The cool, attractive chemistry teacher Kuroki reaches out to the timid, lonely Tomoya. He forces his man-heat into Tomoya's sensitive body at school and on the train they commute by together; forcing Tomoya to drown in lustful pleasure. Pleasure and shame turns into attraction, and Tomoya begins to bloom. As his lonely heart trembles at this unpredictable love, the always kind Sakisaka sweetly approaches him... The men's ecstatic love hungers for Tomoya's affection.\n\n(Source: MU)",
