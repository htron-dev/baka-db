## Sinopse

Remember that plague you learned about in history class? Well, it's back, ready to infect hordes of people! Follow Nagasawa, a melodramic student caught in the middle of this horrid epidemic, with absolutely no idea what's going on, trying to get through life with infected people all about. Can you say creepy?
