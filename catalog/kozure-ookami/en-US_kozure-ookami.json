    "sinopse": "A number of short stories, with a special focus on a pair of divorced fathers who move into the same apartment building on the same day. Developing a sense of camaraderie out of their similar situations, they become fast friends, until one night when they both have a little more to drink than they should...\n\nLike Lone Wolf and Cub times two, minus the swordfights, the samurai, and gore, with more gay love and drinking.\n\n(Source: Vices and Devices)",
