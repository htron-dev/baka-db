## Sinopse

2500 years ago, in India, Siddhartha was born as a prince of the Shakya clan, but he gives up his position as a prince to see the world. While he travels he meets a strange boy named Assaji, who can predict the future and a monk with only one eye. Overwhelmed by the sufferings he witnesses around him, Siddhartha strives to restore peace. Meanwhile, Prince Ruri of Kosara begins his attack on the Shakya clan.
