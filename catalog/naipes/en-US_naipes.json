    "sinopse": "Tarot Cards! For centuries they have been used to tell the fortunes of nobles and royalty. Used by many people, they are composed of 22 major cards and 56 minor cards based on Sephirot, the Tree of Life.\n\nAmong those users, there have been some who materialize the cards' images and meanings and apply them to reality. People who use these powers are known as 'tarot users'.\n\nThe first and the oldest tarot user, 'Ascanio Maria Sforza'. The first 22 tarot cards she ever made. And there was a legend amongst the tarot users. The one who collected all those cards could be granted any wish. That was the legend! Those oldest cards have been called 'Visconti Sforza'!!\n\n(Source: MU)",
