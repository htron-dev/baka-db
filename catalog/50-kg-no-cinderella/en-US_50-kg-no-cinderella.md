## Sinopse

Hime, a chubby girl, is a university student who is currently looking for a job. At a company briefing, she gets injured and is helped by an employee from the information desk, Osamu. With Osamu looking like a prince, Hime falls in love at first sight. Wanting to see him again, Hime went on a diet and successfully lost 50 kilograms. She eventually gets employed at the same company as Osamu, but after an entire year, she has yet to meet him again. One day, the most handsome guy at the company, rumoured to be the son of the CEO, transfers to Hime's department. As it turns out, that man was Osamu! However, Hime's happiness at their reunion is short-lived after Osamu confesses that there is a woman he is interested in. However, for some reason, he keeps hugging her, whispers sweet words to her, and treats her differently. Will Hime remain at the mercy of this unexpected doting...!?
