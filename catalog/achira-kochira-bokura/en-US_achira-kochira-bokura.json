    "sinopse": "One day, Majima, one of everyone's favorite person in class, gets to see a surprising side to Sonoki, the class introvert. Since then, Majima can't help but notice Sonoki and call out to him for no reason, hoping for any kind of reaction... When Sonoki turns red and gets all shy like that, how can Majima not fall in love with him? But when it's time to go up a grade, they're not in the same class anymore...\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
