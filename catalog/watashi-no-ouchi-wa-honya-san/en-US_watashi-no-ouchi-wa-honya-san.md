## Sinopse

Welcome to the life of a fifth grader name Nakazawa Miyu. What makes her life interesting? Six years ago, when her dad asked her who she liked more: mom or dad, she responded with "Ero-hon" (which is pornography books). At the time, she was only a small child and had no idea what that meant. She just heard it from some of the customers at her family bookstore. Now, she lives her daily life surrounded by porn!
