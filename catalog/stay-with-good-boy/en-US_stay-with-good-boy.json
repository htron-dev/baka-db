    "sinopse": "In a world where humans and human-like beasts coexist, Yukari comes across an unconscious Shima in the streets. When Shima wakes, he finds himself in a warm bath, being washed by his savior, Yukari. Shima, prejudiced against humans, starts thinking maybe not all humans are bad until he sees Yukari's scar, the same scar of one of the humans that took Yuki away. Shima, desperate to find Yuki, barges into the underground shop Yukari owns that offers special services from beast to humans. Lo and behold, Yuki is there but is not wanting to go home as Shima imagined. Will Shima be able to return to his village empty-handed? Or will he have to stay in the shop and... work there?\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
