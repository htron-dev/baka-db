    "sinopse": "In a certain part of town, there is a very exclusive restaurant. So exclusive that only ghosts get to dine there! Yes, it's a ghost-only restaurant where ghouls and goblins freely roam, drink and eat! Strange? Not until you meet the only waitress there, who happens to be a full-blooded human!\n\n(Source: Aerandria)",
