## Sinopse

On the summer of 1930, after an arduous sea voyage, Kazuya and Victorique finally arrive at the New Continent. As they are guided across town by two persons they met on the streets, they find themselves attending a party held in the Apocalypse, the high-rise tower that serves as a symbol of the success of the New World. However, in the middle of the festive party, the elevator suddenly explodes, trapping the people on the topmost floor! An ominous message says, "Isn't there a time where Death danced in the dark night?"; what is the truth behind this incident!? Victorique, for the first time, challenges a mystery from the New Continent!
