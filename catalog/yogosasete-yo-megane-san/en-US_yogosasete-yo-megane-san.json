    "sinopse": "Chiaki is a tax accountant who likes collecting glasses and playing with men. One day, he goes to a potential new client's restaurant and meets Suda, the manager. The two hit it off once they realize they are both into spectacles, and go out for drinks.\nChiaki's bad habit of hitting on guys rears its ugly head, and Suda catches him in the act. Surprised to learn that Chiaki likes men, Suda forces him to suck on his member until it explodes all over Chiaki's face...!\n\nThis is a love battle between a fan of giving facials and a glasses enthusiast!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
