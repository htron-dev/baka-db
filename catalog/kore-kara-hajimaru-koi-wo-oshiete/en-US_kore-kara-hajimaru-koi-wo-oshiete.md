## Sinopse

The story is a bit the usual: childhood friends, forced marriage, teacher-student but they are in college, and living together but kept it a secret.

"There are a lot of things that I don’t know, whether it is about myself or about yours. Even love is no exception, so please can you teach me everything?"
