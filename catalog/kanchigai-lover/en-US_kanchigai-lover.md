## Sinopse

Shiratori is secretly in love with his popular subordinate Saeki, whose gentlemanly personality and kindness have earned him the nickname "Misunderstandings Machine." In order to keep his love a secret, he tries to act coldly to Saeki, even though it hurts him. But as he tries to suppress his feelings, Shiratori's imagination begins to run more wild! Are these really just misunderstandings?
