## Sinopse

In the year 1587, the Tokugawa clan is vigilantly looking for a way to destroy Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi depends on the resourceful, intelligent, but slender-looking samurai Sanada Yukimura, to help him protect his people and foil the plots of his enemies. He has also assigned the loud-mouthed, impetuous shinobi Sarutobi Sasuke to work with Sanada, to their mutual annoyance. Though they may hate each other, they're going to have to work together for Hideyoshi's sake!
