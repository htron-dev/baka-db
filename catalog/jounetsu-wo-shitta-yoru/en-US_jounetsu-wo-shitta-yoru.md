## Sinopse

Beth Farley can't stand working at her job while she's in love with her soon-to-be-married boss, Andreas Kyriakis. But before she can even submit her resignation letter, Andreas's arrogant brother, Theo, comes up with a plan to help both of them. The two will pose as lovers so Beth can get Andreas's attention and Theo can break his brother's engagement. But can Beth go through with Theo's plan? And does she still want Andreas now that she's seen another side of Theo?
