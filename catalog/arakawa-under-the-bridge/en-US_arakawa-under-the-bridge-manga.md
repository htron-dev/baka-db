## Sinopse

A young "elite" man, Kou Ichinomiya, has a policy of not being in debt to anyone. However, a series of events lead to him owing his life to a strange girl who goes by the name Nino. She lives under the bridge of the Arakawa River, and says, to Kou's disbelief, that she's a native of the planet Venus, a Venusian. After the ordeal between the two, they become lovers. Kou adopts the name Recruit (Rec) and ends up living under the bridge with Nino and her group of even stranger friends.
