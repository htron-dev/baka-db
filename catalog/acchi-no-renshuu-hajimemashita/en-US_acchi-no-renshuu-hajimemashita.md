## Sinopse

28-year-old Japanese national representative for volleyball, Nohara Suzuki, and Judo, Takaya Yano, are facing the same problem: they both just got dumped because they were too inexperienced in the world of physical relationships. So what do two over-achieving athletes decide to do? Practice, of course! And as Nohara and Takaya practice more and more, they may just find the ones they're practicing for... are each other.
