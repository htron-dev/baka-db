    "sinopse": "Sumire was a high school girl before she leapt into another world the moment she fell down. Before she could collapse and die, she came across a silver-haired boy who had already collapsed and was dying. One thing led to another and she ended up working at an Adventurer's Guild. She doesn't have any special powers, but she's well liked by strange plants and animals. What does Sumire's future hold?!\n\n(Source: MU)",
