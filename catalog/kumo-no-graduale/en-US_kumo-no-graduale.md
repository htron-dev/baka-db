## Sinopse

In a world similar to our early 20th century, airships are the major mean of transportation. A group of aerial bandits, know as "Zarathustra," raids airships with fascinating skills and has angered and been feared by government forces. Yet, their target is not money or treasure: in the name of peace, they locate and destroy arms sales shipped by airships.
