## Sinopse

Sakurai Natsumi's older brother is quite famous at Tokiwa Middle School, he was the previous track and field team captain who everyone respected. On the other hand the new captain, Yoku-senpai, is the best athlete in anything that he tries to do- but his training is a bit different from the previous leader, instead of practicing track and field, he likes to practice basketball and soccer. Natsumi is quite angry at this and tells Yoku-senpai that she will boycott the training if nobody is willing to train. But one day, when some previous track and field members that hated Natsumi's older brother, try to hit her, Yoku-senpai comes in and saves her. Slowly, bit by bit, Natsumi may just be falling in love with Yoku-senpai. But things aren't as simple as they seem, could Koushi, Yoku-senpai's friend, also be falling for Natsumi?!?
