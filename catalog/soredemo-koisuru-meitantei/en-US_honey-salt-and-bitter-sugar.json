Sougo's only joy in life is to pet the flowers growing behind the gymnasium. But one day, even though no one else usually comes by there, Tani, a senior, shows up. Sougo gradually finds himself falling for Tani, who's kind and mysteriously attractive. However, Sougo then finds out about Tani's friend, Shun, whom Tani considers \"important\" to him...\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
