## Sinopse

Problems in love? Don't go to these guys!! A fledgling private eye and his high-strung pretty-boy partner to the rescue! Ginpei Matsuda joined the Natsume Private Investigators to be the "exemplary P.I." he always dreamed of becoming. But his repeated slip-ups earn him nothing but ire from his cruel, cold, and frightening partner, Shun Enomoto. One day, the odd couple take a case to find a young boy's long-lost first-love, and then...!? A labyrinth of love lies just ahead. This frustratingly-tantalizing mismatched-buddy-P.I. love-affair will tickle your expectations!!
