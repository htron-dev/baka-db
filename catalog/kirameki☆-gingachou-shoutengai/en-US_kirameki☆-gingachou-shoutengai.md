## Sinopse

The grocery store's Mike, the fish shop's Kuro, the rice shop's Iba-chan, the soba shop's Kyuu, the yakitori shop's Sato, and the sake shop's Mamoru are childhood friends raised in the Galaxy Street's shopping center. When these six gather they are invincible, but after they entered middle school they stopped gathering!? It's an overflow of love and friendship in the lower part of town.
