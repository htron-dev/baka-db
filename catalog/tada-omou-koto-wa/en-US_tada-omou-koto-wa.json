    "sinopse": "Yuuki has had an unrequited love for his friend Hiroya ever since high school. Hiroya always has a girlfriend, and as a man, Yuuki knows he's outside of Hiroya's romantic interests, and so he just can't confess. He planned to stay as a good friend forever. One day, he drank with Youichi, the only one who knows about his love, but the next morning he woke up to Hiroya kneeling before him! Apparently they did it under the influence, but Yuuki didn't have any memory at all...?\n\n(Source: Kaiohsha, translated)",
