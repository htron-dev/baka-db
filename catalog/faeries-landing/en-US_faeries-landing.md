## Sinopse

A chance encounter with a mysterious character named Goodfellow leads Ryang to spring where faeries are bathing. Here, Ryang meets Fanta, a faerie who wants nothing more than to stay with him in the human world. Living with a faerie can be especially trying, but Fanta makes it worse when her rival curses him to a string of 108 doomed relationships!
