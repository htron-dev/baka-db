## Sinopse

Mikoto has been dating Shinobu for a month, and he's ready to move their relationship to the next level. So ready in fact, that a hug sends him into an elaborate fantasy. Poor, poor deprived Mikoto. But he's not the only one. The erotic imaginations of sexually frustrated high school boys know no bounds!
