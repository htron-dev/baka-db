## Sinopse

Tamura Kouji, Naoya's former co-worker from Yasashii Kankei, finally returns to Okayama to take over his father's car business. Though he still has Naoya on his mind, his family and friends give him a warm welcome and invite him to a class reunion. There, he meets a man that looks strangely like the one who robbed him of his first love, and is just as disagreeable. But while bringing him home in a drunken stupor, Tamura realizes there may just be more to the man than he thinks.
