## Sinopse

This spin-off follows the story between Fukami's rival, President Akutsu, and Risa's close friend, Natsuki!

Thus begins the relationship between the sadistic and selfish President Akutsu, and the stubborn and competitive Nacchan where they are more than sex friends, yet less than lovers. Even though they're certain that they both have feelings for each other, they aren't able to express themselves honestly. Try out a slightly different bittersweet taste from Coffee & Vanilla.
