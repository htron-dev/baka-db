## Sinopse

Tokyo, the imperial capital of the 14th year of the Taishou era. Amen Oryo, a pickpocket girl who lost her parents in the earthquake, met Haruya Karasuma, a high school student who calls himself an "Onmyouji." At that time, heinous crimes were occurring frequently in the Imperial City, but there are rumors that a "tengu" will definitely appear near the scene...!? An exciting Taishou buddy action!!
