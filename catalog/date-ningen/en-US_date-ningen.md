## Sinopse

The 13th year of the Tenshou Era (1573.7.28 - 1592.12.8), young "One-Eyed Dragon" Date Masamune is the head of the powerful Date family. Masamune is very vain, self-centered, and reckless, and has started attacking and conquering all of the regions around his lands. The purpose of his campaign appears to be the acquisition of the treasures these nations possess. Katakura Kojuro, his trusted retainer and friend, does his best to keep Masamune from getting himself killed by his rash and dangerous plans.
