His older brother, Ryou, is dropping him off and also wants to see if the teacher might not be so strict with his brother. In the heat of an argument between Ryou and Kousaka, Shou brags to Kousaka about how much better Ryou is then Kousaka. Shocking Kousaka to the core, he has finally met the person he thought he would never see again.\n\n(Source: MU)",
