## Sinopse

Sonoba Shinogu is the owner and chef of a restaurant called "Heaven's Door," an ordinary and not very popular restaurant. He has two part-time workers who dress as maids, Maeda Atari and Ariga Chie. Through some weird quirk, they begin receiving as customers famous people from throughout history. These people are transported through time and space to Heaven's Door, just before their deaths, and Shinogu has to figure out how to satisfy their order for their last meals. Famous visitors include Japanese historical figures, like Oda Nobunaga and Ryoma Sakamoto, as well as foreigners like Marie Antoinette.
