Freshly divorced from her cheating millionaire ex-husband, she is through with all that and is ready to start a quiet life in a beautiful Italian Villa, an alimony from her ex. But there is one thing that annoys her. Vittorio, the former owner of the estate does not try to hide his disdain for her whom he believes to be a \"dumb glamor girl.\" Disagreeable he may be, she must seek his cooperation to preserve the renowned, \"best lemon grove\" in Amalfi...\n\n(Source: MU)",
