## Sinopse

A samurai manga about a boy named Zan. Zan's father was a legendary swordsman who used a sword which had no blade (think Sakabatou from Ruroken). Zan's father died one day, and ever since, Zan has wanted to follow in his fathers footsteps.

The manga starts off with Zan being transfered to a new high school in his second year. When pushed, Zan somehow becomes super strong and has incredible sword technique that allows him to beat his enemies.
