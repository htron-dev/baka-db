Zan's father died one day, and ever since, Zan has wanted to follow in his fathers footsteps.\n\nThe manga starts off with Zan being transfered to a new high school in his second year. When pushed, Zan somehow becomes super strong and has incredible sword technique that allows him to beat his enemies.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
