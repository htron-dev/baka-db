    "sinopse": "The beauty adviser Natsume is forced to do pair sales with his junior Sahashi. Sahashi, who doesn't take Natsume or his work seriously, overtook Natsume in sales and annoys the latter as he's trying to act as a good superior. One day it gets out that he's gay, and he's threatened into becoming Sahashi's sex friend?! Plus, he accidentally pushed the switch to awaken Sahashi... \"Is it all right if I get serious?\" This is a story set behind the cosmetic shop counter, with feelings of love appearing as Natsume finds his heart beating fast, although it irritates him.\n\n(Source: Libre, translated)",
