## Sinopse

It's warm when they're together. Falling asleep to his own humming, pretending to be a poorly made taxidermy, trying too hard to imitate a "cute raccoon" pose... These are the humorous lovable days of a calm bear and a tanuki who gets easily carried away.

(Source: Kadokawa, translated)
