## Sinopse

Yumi, a seemingly average high school girl, is destined to become the wife of and child bearer for Evil. As soon as her first menstrual episodes begin, all sorts of villainous cretins show up in the hopes of providing the seed for wickedness itself. In response, the forces of Good, a Buddhist priest, the Catholic church, and their attendant holy warriors rush to provide protection for the now-pregnable Yumi. But she reaches out to another warrior, a young punk freshman heartthrob who literally beats off the female population of the school with a stick. But when he sees Yumi in a vision, this cool-as-ice thug melts... and the adventure begins...
