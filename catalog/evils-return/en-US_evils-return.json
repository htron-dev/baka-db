As soon as her first menstrual episodes begin, all sorts of villainous cretins show up in the hopes of providing the seed for wickedness itself. In response, the forces of Good, a Buddhist priest, the Catholic church, and their attendant holy warriors rush to provide protection for the now-pregnable Yumi. But she reaches out to another warrior, a young punk freshman heartthrob who literally beats off the female population of the school with a stick.
