## Sinopse

Renai Nenrei:
Hokuto has a problem. Kuramoto, his employee, has an idea: maybe trying something new will help?

Koi Negawakuha:
The head of a cursed clan, Yukinobu, insists of sleeping with his servant, Kurohoshii, because he reminds him of the disappeared family cat, Kuro. They even share the same scar on the left side of the face, so is Kurohoshii's the cat reincarnation or is it just a coincidence...?!
