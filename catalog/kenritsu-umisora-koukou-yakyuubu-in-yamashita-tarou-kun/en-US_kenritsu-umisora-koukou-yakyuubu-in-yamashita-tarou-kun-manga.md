## Sinopse

Tarou Yamashita is a hopless klutz, but his enthusiasm for baseball know no bounds! Inspired by his passion, the members of the Umisora High School Baseball Club decide to try to compete at the prestigious Koshien Stadium. The sight of the players slowly but surely improving over time got readers fired up in a way many other baseball manga couldn't.
