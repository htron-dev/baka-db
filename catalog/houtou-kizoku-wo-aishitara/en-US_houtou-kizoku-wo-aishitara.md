## Sinopse

Because of her beauty, Sophie was sold by her father at the age of thirteen. Since then, she has been cultivating her life as an opera singer. In Vienna society, Sophie has the reputation of being "classy on the streets, but trashy in the sheets," yet the truth is that she's a virgin. Contrary to public opinion, she has been running away from the desires of men, but nobody believes that. Lord Leo, whom Sophie has fallen in love with for the first time, is no different from the others and tries to buy her. Will he ever see past her reputation to the real woman underneath?
