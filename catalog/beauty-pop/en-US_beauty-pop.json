    "sinopse": "First-year high school student Kiri Koshiba is a skilled hairstylist. Whenever others are bullied or ridiculed for their appearance, she steps in to do some \"magic,\" giving them makeovers that bring out their natural beauty.\n\nAt Kiri's school, three second-year students make up the popular Scissors Project (SP): Shougo Narumi, the hairstylist; Kei Minami, the nail artist; and Kazuhiko Ochiai, the overall beauty consultant. The SP selectively chooses one female student to makeover and produces amazing results every time.\n\nWhen Kanako Aoyama, Kiri's childhood friend, confesses her feelings to Ochiai by giving him a present, she is accused of bribing her way into becoming the next girl for an SP makeover. Kiri comes to Kanako's defense and performs some \"magic\" on her, leaving the SP stunned at Kanako's transformation. Not knowing who is responsible, the SP searches for Kanako's hairstylist in order to have a haircutting showdown, the start of a rivalry between Narumi and Kiri.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Dream Come True\nVolume 3: Teen Drop\nVolume 7: Twisted Typhoon, I Want to Be a Prince\nVolume 10: Shampoo's Concern, Hysteric Heart, Daily Life in the Narumi Family",
