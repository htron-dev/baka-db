## Sinopse

Kusuo Saiki is a high school student who possesses a wide range of psychic abilities. While many may believe these abilities to be a gift, to Kusuo, they are a curse as he must fight strange odds in order to try to live a normal life. Forced to use his psychic powers to protect his secret or to make up for his father's incompetence at work, will Saiki eventually come to realize how his powers can actually help his friends and family?
