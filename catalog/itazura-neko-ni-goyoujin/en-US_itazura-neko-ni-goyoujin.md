## Sinopse

By the adored Kobayashi-sensei’s request, Toshiya takes care of Tetsu, Kobayashi-sensei’s son. Tetsu does perverted things at his leisure in other people’s rooms, assaults people while they sleep, teases, sexually harasses, and is a free spirit who screws around as much as he likes. Toshiya’s virtue and patience are in danger! Toshiya’s manager from work tenderly (with plenty of ulterior motives) grows closer to him as well. The violent love battle between the manager and Tetsu begins! An extremely erotic story from South Korea about a troubled love triangle!

Note: This was written under the pen-name Bellu.
