## Sinopse

After a fairly futile attempt at capturing the heart of Jinnai, Kijima finds himself dealt with a lucky hand once again.

One day, dazzled by the pattern of a beautiful kimono, he suddenly finds himself enchanted by the talent behind its simple genius. Just how far will he go for such a lovely masterpiece?
