## Sinopse

Remake of Tezuka's 1948 one-shot Chiteikoku no Kaijin.

The parents of Isami Nishitani were killed aboard world's first stratospheric rocket ship Luna Park I when the ship exploded. Isami's father was a chemistry professor who left behind a ear of a rabbit which would make the brains of a human work considerably faster. Prof. Frankenstein succeeds in the experiment which transforms the the ear into a human being. Isami, intent on revenging his parents, volunteers as test pilot for earth-penetrating train Luna Park III invented by the designer Sullivan along several other people, including his pet rabbit who was transformed into a human being.
