## Sinopse

Keichi and Sora live a happy life now that they've moved in together. Keichi work as a director at a design office and Sora works as a hostess in a bar while attending university. The odd thing about all that is they're both men, and there's a third person coming in between them. Can Sora and Keichi struggle to live their happy lives in peace, or will the third person win...?
