## Sinopse

Unhappy with his life, 29-year-old Kunimi decides to jump in front of a moving train. But when he wakes up, he realizes he has gone back to being a high schooler! With a lapse in his memories, Kunimi meets a super handsome junior named Gaku. While disappointed that even in this after-life, Kunimi is gay, he gets excited at the prospect of his almost 30-year-old self doing it with a high schooler. When Kunimi finds out Gaku has real feelings for him, he feels bad about having a wet dream about Gaku.

As his memories slowly start to come back to him, 29-year-old Kunimi gets a chance to re-do his high school experience with a genuine and super hot high schooler!
