    "sinopse": "The Ishiyama-dera temple in Outsu announced that the temple's Ishiyama-dera engi emaki scrolls will get their first CG anime adaptation as part of a \"Ishiyama-dera Digital engi emaki Project.\" The anime will depict the first story in the first scroll, which illustrates the Hira Myoujin deity appearing before temple founder Rōben in the form of an old man, and giving him an oracle to construct the Ishiyama-dera.\n\nThe Ishiyama-dera engi emaki are a series of seven scrolls depicting 33 illustrated stories set in and around the temple, including a scene depicting the moment when Murasaki Shikibu allegedly was inspired to write The Tale of Genji while viewing Lake Biwa from the temple. The scrolls are considered an Important Cultural Property, and were first displayed together for the first time in 2012.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
