## Sinopse

A series of loosely-connected vignettes, each lead to the next by a stray thought. A young hit-man chased from his home; a dropped key to a bloody room; a meat-locker to hide a corpse; the watchful eyes of crows; a criminal's chance at salvation; the sight of music in the air. Where will this story take you, and in what place will it end?
