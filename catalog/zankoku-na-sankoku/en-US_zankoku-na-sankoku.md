## Sinopse

Laura and Gabriel were passionately in love - even though she was the daughter of a wealthy family, while he was a mere stable boy. But when Laura's parents reject the penniless Gabriel's proposal to marry their daughter, he disappears in despair. 7 years later, Laura is burdened by huge debts left by her late parents when Gabriel, now a successful and wealthy investor, appears before her. He is not the man she used to know, as he coldly declares: "I bet you never thought this day would come. When our positions are reversed!"
