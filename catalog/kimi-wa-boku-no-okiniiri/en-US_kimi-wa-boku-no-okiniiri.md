## Sinopse

Tatsuki is a hotheaded rich kid and son of a C.E.O., and he looks down on most of the other kids at his college. After getting bored with fooling around with girls, he takes a friend's joke seriously and considers messing around with a guy to get an "even greater power trip." He sets his sights on Miyako Hirota, a poor student who's been said to sell himself for tuition money. After getting what he wants, though... the once-meek Miyako changes his tune. "It'd be bad if your Dad found out about this." This rich boy may have just walked straight into the trap of a deranged sadist who'll show him what pleasure is all about...!
