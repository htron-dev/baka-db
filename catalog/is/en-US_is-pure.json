    "sinopse": "Seto Ichitaka has a crush on Yoshizuki Iori, a girl in his class who has become so popular she now has her own fan club at school. But only a miracle could make him be with her, since the day he first saw Iori-chan, Ichitaka has been too shy to even talk to her.

It seems that things start to look bright for Seto, but then a special childhood friend is coming for a visit...\n\n(Source: ANN)",
