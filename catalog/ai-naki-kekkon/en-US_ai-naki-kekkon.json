    "sinopse": "They had shared a beautiful affair.\n\nThen Briony had learned the shattering truth. Although she had been deeply in love with Kieron, a reporter then, he had wanted her only for a newspaper scoop. It was painfully ironic to Briony that his calculated lovemaking should have resulted in such a beautiful baby boy...\n\nIt was no less ironic that Kieron Blake should now be Briony's new boss at the Daily Globe.\n\nOne look at little Nicky told him the truth--and set them on a collision course. Either she married him or he took her son away!\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
