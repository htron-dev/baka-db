## Sinopse

They had shared a beautiful affair.

Then Briony had learned the shattering truth. Although she had been deeply in love with Kieron, a reporter then, he had wanted her only for a newspaper scoop. It was painfully ironic to Briony that his calculated lovemaking should have resulted in such a beautiful baby boy...

It was no less ironic that Kieron Blake should now be Briony's new boss at the Daily Globe.

One look at little Nicky told him the truth--and set them on a collision course. Either she married him or he took her son away!
