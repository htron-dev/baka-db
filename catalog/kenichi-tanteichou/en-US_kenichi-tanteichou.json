    "sinopse": "\"Chief Detective Kenichi\" is a detective Manga in which boy detective Kenichi clears up a lot of mysteries and tricks, and settles cases. Kenichi is the chief detective of Boy Detectives' Street Society, which has 26 branches nationwide. Always with him is Donguri, a myna bird. Donguri can reproduce the voice of a person it hears only once more precisely than a tape recorder. It can also go to high or narrow places, and wins wild birds over to its side. It is a reliable \"right-hand bird\" for Kenichi.\n\nKenichi and Donguri first face a radioactive fish case at Mount Oharai, and next search for the cursed secret treasure of Gandhara in the hinterlands of India. They also confront the Showa Shinsen-gumi, which is fighting for a bad cause. And they are facing another difficult case today.\n\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)",
