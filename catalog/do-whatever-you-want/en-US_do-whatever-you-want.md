## Sinopse

Jinwon Hyun is a carefree and outgoing high school student. He is a great dancer and has a pretty girlfriend. One day, however, he notices that someone is constantly staring at him. He finds out it's none other than a classmate named Hosoo—who has a girlfriend of his own—and Jinwon is faced with a very strange and worrisome dilemma. The two boys find themselves gradually becoming attracted to each other's songs and hopes. This subtle shonen-ai story of love, pain, and youthful angst will break readers' hearts and leave them totally infatuated with Yeri Na and her characters. (Source: Netcomics)
