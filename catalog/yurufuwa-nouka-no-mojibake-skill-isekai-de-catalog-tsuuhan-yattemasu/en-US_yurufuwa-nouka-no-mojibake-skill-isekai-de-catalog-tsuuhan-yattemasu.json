    "sinopse": "Tatsuya, a 29-year-old bachelor, gets accidentally summoned to another world and obtains \"Agricultural Skills.\" In order to survive, he starts a vegetable garden in a secluded forest. He thought that his life in another world would be extremely difficult, but the ingredients in this other world were delicious and the crops he grew on his own were also very delicious! Furthermore, he's also very happy with the dishes he made with Japanese seasonings! Typical. Rice and sake are going to be a staple apparently, but you guys know the drill. Besides, if there are beautiful brides, isn't it okay if he lives in this other world? Loose and fluffy, a relaxing other world harem life!!\n\n(Source: Square Enix, translated)",
