    "sinopse": "At age 20, Yuko is leading a life without aspirations, what with work as an assistant in a company and her boyfriend Yutaka. Determined to give a new twist to her lifestyle, she accepts Yutaka's offer to work at his side by night as a bar hostess. But Yuko quickly becomes disenchanted: this choice brings her much more trouble than pleasant surprises, leading her to face difficult situations, even dangerous ones. And above all, she doesn't succeed in getting closer to Yutaka who remains elusive and indifferent to her signs of affection. Despite his infidelity, Yuko persists in clinging to that futile and fruitless relationship. Will she react before being unable to break the deadlock? How far will she let herself go?",
