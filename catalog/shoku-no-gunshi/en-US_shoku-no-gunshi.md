## Sinopse

Ban Hongou is a middle-aged man who is very particular about delicious meals. He would follow his own "tactics"—the advice of his inner "strategist"—on what to order as well as what sequence to eat. He visits all sorts of eating establishments and refines his strategy in pursuit of the perfect meal.
