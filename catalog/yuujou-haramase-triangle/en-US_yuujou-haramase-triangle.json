That's because of his two alpha best friends: the masculine and strong-willed Kiyohisa and the handsome and intellectual Haruto. Their friendship was irreplaceable to Shun, but secretly he has always been in love with Kiyohisa... One day, he came home only to be informed, \"You're betrothed to Haruto now.\" This is going to mess up their friendship, and his feelings for Kiyohisa!!
