    "sinopse": "Maki, who works for a big company, has secret feelings for one of his subordinates, his boss' son Sudou. He's been assigned to watch over Sudou, so as to prevent him from making mistakes that would compromise his brilliant future. One night, however, Sudou catches sight of Maki in Tokyo's gay district, kissing a man. Driven by his curiosity, Sudou promises to keep quiet about itâ€”only if Maki sleeps with him. When the two men start a physical relationship, Maki still hopes that Sudou's curiosity towards him will continue. But he'll quickly realize that it's not the only obstacle he'll have to overcome...\n\n(Source: Ikemen Scans)",
