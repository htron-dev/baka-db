## Sinopse

Host Miyama Tooru has climbed to be the No.1 host in Kabukichou with his ability to "read minds" and his handsome face. Of course, that power is a secret to others. Furthermore, he has another secret: he's actually a hardcore fan of a male model, Hikawa Mizuki...!

One day, he meets Mizuki by chance. Tooru who feels like he's reached Seventh Heaven, peeks into Mizuki's mind on a whim and finds himself being tied up, caned, and toyed with there?!
