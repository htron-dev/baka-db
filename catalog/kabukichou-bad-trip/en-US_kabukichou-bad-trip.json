    "sinopse": "Host Miyama Tooru has climbed to be the No.1 host in Kabukichou with his ability to \"read minds\" and his handsome face. Of course, that power is a secret to others. Furthermore, he has another secret: he's actually a hardcore fan of a male model, Hikawa Mizuki...!\n\nOne day, he meets Mizuki by chance. Tooru who feels like he's reached Seventh Heaven, peeks into Mizuki's mind on a whim and finds himself being tied up, caned, and toyed with there?!\n\n(Source: Libre, translated)",
