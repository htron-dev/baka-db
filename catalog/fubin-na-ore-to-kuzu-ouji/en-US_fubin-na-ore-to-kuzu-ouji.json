    "sinopse": "High schooler Keisuke Sotoki has never been lucky in his life. He has always been a \"misfortune magnet.\" He always wishes his misfortune will end, until one day when he woke up butt-naked with a handsome guy on top of him saying \"Hand over your butt to me.\" Later, he found out that the guy is Mahara, the first prince of Latula, and that he is not a human but a \"magus.\" Mahara said that they are a fated pair and that Sotoki's curse could be lifted if they got together. But that's easier said than done because they're both straight. And only Sotoki can see Mahara. What will happen next?!\n\n(Source: MU, edited)",
