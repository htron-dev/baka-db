## Sinopse

This is Tenjin street in Hinomaru city, a normal shopping street with various stores and a shrine watching over from above the hill.

After six year, Yukimura Takashi returned to this hometown of his. That day, his father took him to the local shop community meeting, where he luckily wins a lottery. Unknown yet to him of why everyone is so happy, Takashi is actually chosen as the new head of the shopping street community.

The head of Tenjin shopping street is not just a title. The head of the community also acts as a medium to the gods that brings good luck to everyone, a god called Ofuku-san.

Although Ten-chan (Takashi) still doesn’t gladly accept the responsibility thrown at him by his family and the previous chief, he tries his best, together with his childhood friends from the neighbourhood.
