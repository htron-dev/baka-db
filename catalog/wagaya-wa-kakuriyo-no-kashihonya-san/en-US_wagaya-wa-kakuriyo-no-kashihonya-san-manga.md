## Sinopse

The realm of the dead: that is the world where Ayakashi live. One human lived in this world where the sun doesn't shine that is filled with man-eating Ayakashi. She runs a bookstore with her Ayakashi adoptive father, Shinonome, and meets a bleeding youth who faints... It's fun, scary, and sad story about the realm of the dead.
