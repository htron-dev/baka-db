    "sinopse": "\"You're so sensitive... Look at how wet you already are.\" With the skillful caress of his fingers and tongue, Chika melts to the core and her mind goes blank!! Even though it's her first time...! Deciding to commute to college, Chika takes the opportunity to move to Tokyo and live with her female cousin, Kaoru, whom she admired as a child. But the Kaoru she meets again after so many years was actually a guy all along! Plus he's cool, aggressive and sadistic...! Chika is bewildered by the difference in Kaoru as he asks, \"Do you want to see how I've changed?\" In the shower he makes her so wet down there with incredible tricks that she can't breathe. It feels so good she can't resist. No one told her about this lewd lifestyle together!!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
