## Sinopse

36-year-old Yasano Mamoru woke up one morning and realized that he has lost his memory. Not only that, he learns that he has a 16-year-old wife who still goes to high school. Mamoru can't believe that Hana is really his wife or that he is a famous erotic manga author. His representative at the manga publisher, the beautiful Shirabe Hoko, even comes to try to help him regain his memory but nothing helps. However, as Mamoru gets closer to Hana, he slowly starts getting bits and pieces of his past back. Little does he know, something may have happened between Hoko and him the night before he lost his memory that could affect his marriage with Hana...
