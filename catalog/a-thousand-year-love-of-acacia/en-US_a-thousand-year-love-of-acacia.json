But Lamec, the young king of Egypt, while conquering Libya (and killing Acacia's parents) falls in love with Acacia. He brought her back to Egypt with an intention of marrying her. But Lamec is already engaged to the powerful princess of Egypt. It is because of her who gave up the throne for Lamec that he was able to become king. The Egyptian princess throws Lamec, the king, (no, I'm not kidding) into prison because he wanted to break up their engagement. After giving up on changing Lamec's mind, she kills him.\nThe prince of Hittite came to try to save Acacia but failed. He died while protecting her. The evil Egyptian princess then throws Acacia into a dungeon and opens the water ways for her to drown.",
