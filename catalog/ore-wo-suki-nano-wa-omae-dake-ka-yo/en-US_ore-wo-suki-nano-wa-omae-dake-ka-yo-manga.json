    "sinopse": "Amatsuyu Kisaragi, better known as Jouro, has a reputation for being a kind and helpful person, but he has little that makes him stand out. On the other hand, his best friend Taiyou Ooga, nicknamed Sun-chan, is the captain of the baseball team and an extrovert, usually getting all the girls. However, Jouro isn't as plain as he seems; in reality, he is quite manipulative and is currently trying to make two girls fall for him—his childhood friend and the president of the student council.\n\nJouro wants the two to confess to him in his \"perfect harem plan,\" perfectly setting them up to like him. But when he is coerced into what appears to be a confession by both of them, he is not elated; instead, he is baffled as they reveal that the two of them like Sun-chan and want Jouro to help them in their romantic endeavors! Furthermore, he finds out the next day that while there actually is someone interested in him, a quiet girl named Sumireko Sanshokuin, she has an extremely unpleasant personality and is determined to interfere in his plans!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
