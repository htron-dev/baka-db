## Sinopse

Erotic drama set in the Edo period. The nue is a mythical beast, a kind of chimera, which is a living bad omen. The main character, a pretty boy who often dresses like a girl to trick lecherous men out of their pocket money, resembles the nue in that he appears to be bad news for everyone whom he meets. His chivalrous manners attract women, too. The other main character is a strikingly handsome samurai who is unsure if he can trust the nue boy’s love. Is it just an act?
