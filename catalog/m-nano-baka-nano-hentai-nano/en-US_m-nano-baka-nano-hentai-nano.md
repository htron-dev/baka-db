## Sinopse

When Aizawa was little he used to enjoy being a bully and picking on Hidaka. Due to the bullying, Hidaka moved away. And once Aizawa went to high school he made a vow to himself to never bully anyone. Oh, no! Who is this new transfer student?!

It's Hidaka! Hidaka hasn't or shall I say, can't forget Aizawa. Hidaka has been looking forward to this reunion for years. Hidaka asks to meet Aizawa after school and the first thing he asks is for Aizawa to bully him like he did in the past?!
