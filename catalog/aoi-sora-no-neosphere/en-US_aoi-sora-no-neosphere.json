    "sinopse": "After the world unification wars, the Kingdom of Neosphere has gradually led an era of decline. The once \"Holy Kingdom\" now lacks the resources or personnel to repair its own E-technology, and the E-Ships that connect its commerce to the land-bound countries have declined in numbers. The newly anointed Queen of Neosphere, realizing that her country needs help, issued a summoning letter to the father of E-technology Prospero Flanka. He could not make the summons, so he sent his granddaughter, Nanoka. Nanoka has grown up with her grandfather's inventions and golems, proving to be able to help rebuild Neosphere.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
