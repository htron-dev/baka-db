    "sinopse": "He has never been the type to stand out in the class. Kurihara Yuzuru has lived life by avoiding entering the lives of others, staying to himself. The story begins where he has to go to a whole new school, which means new classmates. He lacks any confidence to make new friends, so the fear of rejection drives him into a wish he never thought he would make. This single wish leads to a first day of class he would never forget. Yuzuru will have to make choices that will significantly alter others' lives, choices he could never make in the past.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
