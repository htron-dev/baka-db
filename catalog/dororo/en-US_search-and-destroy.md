## Sinopse

After the war, robots known as Creatures, once mass-produced as laborers and soldiers, flooded the city. Some went to the streets, and some to the underworld of society, creating friction with the citizens. One night, a girl who is neither human nor robot appears in front of a yakuza Creature that had seized the orphan Doro. The girl, wearing the fur of a beast, attacks the Creature in a rage with strong weapons attached on her limbs. Who is she? What is she fighting for?
