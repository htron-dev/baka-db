## Sinopse

This is the era of the Three Kingdoms.

Between the water and fish, it is said that one can't live without the other. It is the same as the relation between generals and strategists. Elite generals and strategists are the specialists when it comes to battle. What secrets are they hiding about their special abilities?!
