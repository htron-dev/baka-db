Kasuga Haru was newly appointed to this prestigious position and was next to the Kingdom's one and only princess. There's only one problem. Their \"royal princess\" is a hikikomori, a recluse who stuffs her room with video games and refuses to leave even a nanometer out of her room. Kasuga's special mission given by the Queen is to make Princess Terras into a proper human. Can Kasuga succeed in turning this otaku princess into a proper princess full of charm and beauty?\n\n(Source: MU)",
