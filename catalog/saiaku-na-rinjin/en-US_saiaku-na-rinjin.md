## Sinopse

High school teacher Hakura only wanted to live a peaceful, solitary life. However, as fate would have it, his new neighbor was none other than his nemesis, Hashigami. From the moment Hashigami moved in, he was already wreaking havoc on Hakura's peaceful existence.

Why would the outgoing, popular, intelligent, athletic, and good-looking Hashigami keep torturing Hakura? So it was no surprise Hashigami became Hakura's living nightmare. And just when Hakura thought things couldn't get any worse, guess where Hashigami started working...?!
