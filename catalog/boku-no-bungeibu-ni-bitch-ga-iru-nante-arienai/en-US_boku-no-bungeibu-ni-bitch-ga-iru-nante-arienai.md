## Sinopse

"Real beautiful girls are mostly bitches."

With that motto in mind, Ikuno Kousuke used his literature club room to enjoy his otaku life. One day, he was told by the student council president's assistant, Shinonome Ibuki, that the literature club will be disbanded, unless he will become a consultant for the student council together with Ibuki.

Their first job is to help the girl who splits the fame in school into two, the blonde, big-breasted Aizawa Mahana. Although there are rumors about her dating many boys, she actually doesn't have any experience about love so she wants Kousuke to be her fake lover...!?

The love comedy about bitch and otaku begins.
