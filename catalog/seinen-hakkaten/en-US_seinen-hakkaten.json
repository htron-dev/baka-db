    "sinopse": "Though he seems completely indifferent to romance, high schooler Manabu works part-time as a writer for an erotic magazine. One day, right when some classmates were about to pick a fight with him, he was saved by Yamaguma, an underclassman. Apparently Yamaguma, who is popular but unfamiliar with romance, is upset about his older sister working at a nightclub. While trying to desensitize Yamaguma of his excessive reaction to Manabu's erotic writing, they...? The heat of their connected hands is the folly of youth. A bittersweet diary of first love.",
