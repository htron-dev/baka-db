As a talent scout for the adult video firm, M+ Productions, he hunts for potential actresses but it's not enough to pay the rent. So boss Nanazuka offers him extra cash to use his body to seduce men and women alike. Michiru, a spoilt young woman with Yakuza connections, comes up with what appears to be a perfect solution: she'll be Rendou's patron in return for him working as her full-time host. Will Rendou finally be able to write his poetry? Or will he end up corrupted by the amoral dog-eat-dog world around him?",
