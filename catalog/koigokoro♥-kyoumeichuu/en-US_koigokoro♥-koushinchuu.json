Yet every time Ritsuka carries out a legend superstition, Kuze-kun gets in her way...\n\nAlthough they fight all the time, Kuze-kun is always there for her when she's feeling scared or anxious. While his words are ill-natured, he is kind to her, so Ritsuka feels happy even when she's mad at him...\n\nRitsuka falls in love with Kuze-kun. After four of the legendary superstitions were completed, Ritsuka and Kuze-kun fell in love with each other, but...?!\n\n(Source: Fate & Enchantment Scans)",
