## Sinopse

"I've come back for you." The handsome boy who moved away ten years ago has returned... with a super scary face?!

Sachi, the 26 year old manager of a little florist shop, was closing up when suddenly a high schooler with a terrifying face approached saying, "I came as promised."

The manly and earnest high schooler with a terrifying face and the super dull plain jane, in a heart bursting love story!
