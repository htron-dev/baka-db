She's wide open, rather naive, and with her around, it's just one crazy day after another. Romantic comedy author Hiroyuki Tamakoshi, author of \"Boys Be,\" brings us the unlikely love story of a hopeless office worker and the extraordinarily beautiful girl who lives with him. Take care of your doggy!\n\n(Source: MangaBox)",
