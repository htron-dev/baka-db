## Sinopse

Young Master Ruiko, as yet in high school, is being trained to succeed his ailing grandfather as president of the company. Appointed to be his tutor is Naguko Shouichi, a highly valued employee of his grandfather's. Initially pleased with the arrangement, Ruiko comes upon Naguko kissing a man, and throws a major hissy fit because oh noes, homos are so disgusting. And yet, whenever Naguko stands close to him, Young Master Ruiko gets those strange, warm feelings creeping all through his body.
