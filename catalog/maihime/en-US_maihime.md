The wanderings of youth on the stage of 19th century Berlin. The legendary novel of Meiji writer Mori Ogai, "Maihime (dancing girl)," adapted by Ga-nime "School Girl" producer Oku Shutaro who shows us his illustration talent and appoints Ms FURUYA Akisa for the booklets, slide shows, and animation of this Ga-nime. Over the background of a foreign country, we discover all the pathetic, poetic feelings of this elegant story as the wind of fresh artistic images brings it to life.
