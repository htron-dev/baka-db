## Sinopse

Tadahiro Nasu is a downtrodden convenience store worker with nothing to live for but watching VR performances of Misaki Kanzaki, an idol who was once his classmate. Unable to take his oppressive life any longer, he electrocutes himself, only to find that his body has become pure electricity. With his newfound power to manipulate electrical objects, he'll do anything to support Misaki, whether she likes it or not.
