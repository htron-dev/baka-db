## Sinopse

"If you could redo your high school life one more time, what would you do?"

A mysterious power, "Syndrome," which is contracted simply by enrolling into Wazuki High School.

Due to that power, Yokosuka Hiroto had his time forcefully rewound three years back. Without knowing the circumstances, nor who's ability was responsible, what he was left with were merely faint memories. In this situation the goal Hiroto set for himself was: To make these three blank years into the best high school experience!?
