## Sinopse

Oga-kun is able to see spirits, however, he has no exorcising power, and such a thing is enough of a reason to be jilted. When the new school term comes, Oga-kun's attitude changes, especially since a spirit that drives him crazy possesses Oga-kun's seat! Moreover, the honest Oga-kun is, as a matter of fact, very handsome, highly spontaneous, and quite forgetful?!
