## Sinopse

The manga is based on the "This Man" urban legend, which supposedly began when a woman living in New York told her psychiatrist in 2006 that she had been seeing the face of a man she had never met before in her dreams. Supposedly, more than 3,000 people all over the world have claimed to see "This Man" while dreaming. In present-day Japan, Hakaru Amano, an investigator who works with facial composites, is asked by a mother and daughter to draw the face of a man who illegally trespassed on their premises. He comes up with the face of "This Man."

The story of a serial killer begins to unfold.
