Supposedly, more than 3,000 people all over the world have claimed to see \"This Man\" while dreaming. In present-day Japan, Hakaru Amano, an investigator who works with facial composites, is asked by a mother and daughter to draw the face of a man who illegally trespassed on their premises. He comes up with the face of \"This Man.\"\n\nThe story of a serial killer begins to unfold.",
