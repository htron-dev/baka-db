    "sinopse": "Unknown to her classmates, Yukina Himuro is secretly the popular cell phone novelist Yupina. What they do know, however, is her cold demeanor and icy glare—earning her the nickname \"Absolute Zero Snow Woman\"—so they tend to avoid her.\n\nBut as of late, Yukina has run into a bit of a snag with her writing: her ratings have gone down, so she wants to incorporate romance to bring them back up. And since Yukina has no experience with love, she cannot properly convey it in her writing. While seeking to change this, she runs into popular and charming student council president Shigure Kitami. During said encounter, he drops his notebook, and, to Yukina's surprise, she finds the names of the girls who have confessed to Shigure inside. She discovers that he uses his charm to manipulate girls into confessing their love for him just so he can reject them, and that his real personality is nothing like the one he shows to the world. Confronting Shigure with this information, she develops a plan: to blackmail him into teaching her about love. But when Yukina's cousin and only friend, Akira Shimotsuki, becomes jealous and confesses his love to her, Yukina may find herself with more help for these \"missions of love\" than she asked for.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
