    "sinopse": "This manga looks like it would be the perfect thing for younger readers. But it's something more appropriate for teenagers. It's still darn cute, though.The series is about a kitten (who's drawn to look human!) named Fancia who adores her master more than anything. She also has interesting relationships with several other cats in the neighborhood which only confuses her understanding(?) of the human world.\n\n(www.mangaupdates.com)",
