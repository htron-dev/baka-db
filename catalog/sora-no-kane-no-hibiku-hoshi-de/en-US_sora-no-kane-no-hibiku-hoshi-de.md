## Sinopse

The ringing of the bell from the blue moon, the "auspicious pillar" floating in the sky...

In a particular season of the year, melodies similar to bell rings could be heard throughout the planet. A gigantic, floating pillar exists in this world, which is known as the "auspicious pillar." It has been rumored that around midnight, the figure of a young girl would appear near parts of the "auspicious pillar."

To investigate this rumor Ferio decides to pay the pillars a visit and in front of him appears a young girl who is oddly dressed.

History is written through the encounter of the boy and girl.
