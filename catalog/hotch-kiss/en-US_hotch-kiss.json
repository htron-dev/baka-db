    "sinopse": "Shigeru is a smooth-talking 2nd-year student at Tsunekusu Gakuen, which prides itself on offering an enjoyable school life for all students. To this end, there is a shop that almost every student knows about, selling everything from exam cheat sheets, scouting reports for upcoming matches, photos of girls, and even things that look like love potions. In the past, good luck charms for attaining love were also sold there and were quite popular.\n\nThis shop is known as ‘gakuen seikatsu sougojo kenkyuukai’ (research society for helping each others’ school lives), shortened as ‘gojoken’. Shigeru went to check it out of curiosity and instead found the school idol Yukino there as a replacement sales person for the leader. Irritated at her awkward service, he decided to help himself, but ended up being mistaken for a salesperson by the other students. One day, Yukino called him up to the rooftop and gave him a stapler. She told him that it was a stapler of eternal bonds.\n\n(Source: Hau~ Omochikaeri!)",
