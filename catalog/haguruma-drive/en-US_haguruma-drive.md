## Sinopse

Gear up for a magical new adventure! In a world where magic abounds, 15-year-old Anti Kythera is the odd one out. No matter how hard she studies, she can’t even use the most basic of skills. Her only hope is her upcoming Skill Bestowal: a ceremony that can help even the chronically magicless discover their talent. But what Anti receives is something completely new: Gearcraft, a skill that allows her to make and control golden gears! What can a restaurant owner’s daughter, much less an aspiring adventurer, do with gears? As it turns out, quite a bit. But it’s going to take a little imagination, and a lot of effort, if she’s going to discover the secrets of this never-before-seen power. Can Anti tame the tiara-shaped artifact that calls itself "Crown Gear"? Will she ever become as great as her idol, Purple Lightning? Join her as she gets into gear for a life of adventure!
