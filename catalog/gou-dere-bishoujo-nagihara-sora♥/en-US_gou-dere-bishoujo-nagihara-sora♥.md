## Sinopse

Shouta Yamakawa is an otaku who spends most of his time reading manga. He claims that the only way he would fall in love with a woman is if she were 2D. So one day, while absorbed in his favorite manga, he has a passing thought wishing for his beloved comic heroine, Sora Nagihara, to come to life. To his surprise, she pops right out of the book!

Unfortunately for Shouta, all does not appear as it seems. Presented as frail and endearing in the manga, Sora now introduces herself as an aggressive goudere—a girl who will let nothing and no one stand in the way of pleasing her beloved. Further, Sora believes the world is an erotic game that she must help Shouta conquer! How will Shouta cope with becoming the master of such a chaotic girl?
