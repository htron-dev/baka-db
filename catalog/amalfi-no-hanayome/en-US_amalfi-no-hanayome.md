## Sinopse

One night during a solitary trip to Italy, the straitlaced Regina spends the night with a dangerous gigolo! She can't believe a smart lawyer like herself would give herself to a man she just met... This was how daringly irresistible this man Nico was to women. Nico seems to be somewhat of a celebrity in his hometown. But Regina didn't know that he is actually a renowned prince!
