## Sinopse

Tsukishita is completely dependant on his little brother. It's the first day of school and his little brother has already had to find Tsukishita with the things he's forgotten. When a group of girls try to help him find his older brother, they mistakenly think he's Kagumi's. When Kagumi realizes who he is he also remembers the day he confessed to Tsukishita. Tsukishita offhandedly said some heartless things to Kagumi; did he really mean them the way it sounded?
