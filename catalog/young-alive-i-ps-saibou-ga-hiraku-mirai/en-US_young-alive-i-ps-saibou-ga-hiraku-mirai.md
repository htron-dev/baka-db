## Sinopse

Sixth grader Nozomi Nanase spends a summer with her grandfather, a family doctor in a rural clinic. In the mountain village in the midst of nature, animals and insects live powerful and fearless.

One day, Nozomi discovers that lizards have special cells that can regenerate parts of their body. While grandfather leads you through the living nature and the wonders of the human body, Nozomi learns about iPS cells (induced pluripotent stem cells) and their immeasurable possibilities for the future.
