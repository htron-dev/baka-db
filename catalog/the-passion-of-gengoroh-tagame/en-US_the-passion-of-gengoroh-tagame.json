    "sinopse": "A collection of works by the undisputed gay bondage comics master Gengoroh Tagame, designed by Chip Kidd and introduced by literary icon Edmund White.\n\nPictureBox’s oversized omnibus includes ten English editions of short stories dating from the late 1990s to 2012. The newest work, however, will be an original story commissioned by Chip Kidd himself: Tagame’s very first foray into writing directly for an American reader.\n\n(Source: PictureBox)",
