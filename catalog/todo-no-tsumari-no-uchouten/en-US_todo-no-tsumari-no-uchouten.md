## Sinopse

Nekozaki Ren abused her powers as school council secretary to secretly set up a Miko Club in her school's abandoned shrine. All of this so she could spend time with her crush, Yamada Mikoto, after school. But this wasn't meant to last. Before long some people caught wind of their little club site, and with the school’s club building fully occupied, they saw themselves fit to use the shrine for their own club activities instead! Will Ren be able to reclaim her paradise?
