## Sinopse

Kurumi should be an old lady, but she is still just a young girl. In all her years, she's never opened a present and believes that people must get older because age is included in those wrapped boxes. Now she travels around, bestowing gifts on "worthy" recipients. But these presents never turn out to be what they really wanted. There's always a dark side and a high price to pay—so if Kurumi offers you a present, run!
