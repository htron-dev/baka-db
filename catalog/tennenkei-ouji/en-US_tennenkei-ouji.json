Masafumi, dubbed the Prince of School, lives in a mansion with a household of mostly servants and his grandparents. His current status? Rich. When Masafumi decides to throw away 40 cents which Aoi could have used, she's enraged at his action of discarding the valuable amount, and vows to never forgive him! But, what happens when fate brings Aoi to the Prince's door, in place of her mother, who is injured? Revenge? Schooling in the antics of the poor? (Source: Serenus Dreamers)",
