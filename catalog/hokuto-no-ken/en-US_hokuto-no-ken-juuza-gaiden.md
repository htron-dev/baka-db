## Sinopse

Juuza is a total rebel who obeys and bows to absolutely no one, and with his terrible self taught fighting style, he has absolutely no one to fear.

Juuza once gave up on his true love since he realized blood relation made a relationship impossible... But now that she is dead, Juuza has a thing or two to say to the man who was unable to protect her.
