## Sinopse

Toki is a former Hokuto practitioner, and his incredible strength coped with his knowledge of the assassin art would be enough to call him devil.... But Toki's kindness and desire to help people prevent them from calling him devil, they instead can only whisper words akin to that of 'savior'.
