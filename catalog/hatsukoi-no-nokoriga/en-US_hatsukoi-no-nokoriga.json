    "sinopse": "Thea is to marry the eldest son of the notable Ashton family in just a few days. But that's when her first love—the one she hasn't forgotten about after eight years—shows up. Her heart becomes restless when she faces her first love and his suggestive stare. Zeke used to be an heir to the Ashton family, but he left after his relationship with his father deteriorated. He asked Thea to come with him, but she declined his offer. So why has he come back now... and why does she still want him?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
