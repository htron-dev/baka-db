## Sinopse

"Geass" is a supernatural ability bestowed upon people who are worthy of its use. Its exact effect depends on its user's desires, but those who command it wield devastating power.

In the far away land of Area 11, formerly known as Japan, the astute 17-year-old student Lelouch Lamperouge is granted his own Geass by the mysterious woman C.C., which gives him the absolute obedience of those it is used upon. With this, Lelouch vows to destroy the only world superpower—the Holy Britannian Empire—under the guise of the revolutionary freedom-fighter Zero, to exact vengeance on those who ruined him and his family.
