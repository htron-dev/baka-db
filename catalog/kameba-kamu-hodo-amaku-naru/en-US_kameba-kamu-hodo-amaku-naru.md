## Sinopse

Akari is a high school girl full of curiosity that lives surrounded by her favorite people and things. She leads an exciting life, and thanks to a strange turn of events, she becomes interested in the "Disinterested Prince," a boy that doesn't show any interest in people or things in general. Although he said "Isn't it just annoying to get involved with strangers?" He sometimes looks lonely, making Akari's desire to know more about his world grow.
