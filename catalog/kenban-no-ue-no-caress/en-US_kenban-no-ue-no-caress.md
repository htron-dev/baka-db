## Sinopse

The prodigy, Isshiki Kyouya, selected Sasa Kenjirou as his piano teacher. Sasa, who used to be a prodigy, thought that his own potential was limited when he heard the young Isshiki played at a concert. However, Isshiki was actually captivated by Sasa’s music instead years back. Their love for each other was connected through their music. With the reverberating affection, this relationship blossomed miraculously.
