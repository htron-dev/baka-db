## Sinopse

Vocalist Shori and guitarist Nozomu are engulfed in a passionate love affair when they should be studying for their college entrance exams. And arrogant bassist Ai is going to America alone? Even worse, drummer Yumeji seems to be involved in a mysterious incident. Looks like the day when the band members take off their school uniforms and go their separate ways is quickly approaching. The band might be breaking up as reality intrudes on their simply school lifestyle, but you can bet that these guys are going out on a blaze of glory.
