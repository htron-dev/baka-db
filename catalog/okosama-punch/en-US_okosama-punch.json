    "sinopse": "Ichigo is a 4th grader who is intent on falling in love, but everyone around her tells her that she's too young to understand what love really is. She lives next door to two brothers: Ryouji, the typical hot, friendly guy, and Souji, who is quite scary-looking. Since Ichigo's elementary school and Souji's high school are right next to each other, they end up walking to and from school every day. Ichigo comes to find out that Souji really isn't a bad guy, he just has a scary face.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Ouji-sama ni wa Osawari Kinshi",
