## Sinopse

Teru loves ice skating, but he had to give up on his dream of becoming a figure skater when he was young due to economic reasons. Now he works at a skating rink, where he has a fateful encounter with Izumi, a boy with a natural gift in ice skating and a candidate to win a medal at the next Olympics. Izumi's coach takes note of Teru's abilities, and tells Teru to practice with Izumi. Does Teru still have a chance to become a professional figure skater?
