## Sinopse

After a night of drinking, Neko woke up to find another man sleeping naked next to him. His clothes were strewn about and there was a pile of used condoms in the trash. "White liquid stained the sheets but it can't be mine because... I can't get an erection, so there's no way I could ejaculate!"

Neko, a young man with a Kansai dialect suffering from ED, and Inukai, who helps him deal with it.
