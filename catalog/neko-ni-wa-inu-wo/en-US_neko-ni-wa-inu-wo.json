His clothes were strewn about and there was a pile of used condoms in the trash. \"White liquid stained the sheets but it can't be mine because... I can't get an erection, so there's no way I could ejaculate!\"\n\nNeko, a young man with a Kansai dialect suffering from ED, and Inukai, who helps him deal with it.\n\n(Source: Takeshobo, translated)",
