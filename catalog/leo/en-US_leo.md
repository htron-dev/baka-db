## Sinopse

If people who turn into animals really existed in the modern world, how would they behave? This book gives some realistic, yet unexpected, answers. Nobody is a complete good guy or bad guy; every character is a complex figure, and even the bad guys have some very good reasons for what they do. Leo is an innocent caught in the midst of it all, but nothing like the "helpless killer" stereotype of American werewolf movies. He is a person in control of his own powers, trying to decide what to do with his life now that so much has changed.
