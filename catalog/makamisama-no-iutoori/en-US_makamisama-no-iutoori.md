## Sinopse

Being abandoned in the forest, Master saved her. Staying with him ever since, he left her one day. Bringing her to the place of his relative, he promised her that he will come for her someday. All she has left was the bell he left for her. Eight years have passed, Tamao is still waiting for him. Sengo, the child of the family she's living with, was in love with her. Being a model and the center of attraction of the girls, he was unable to catch her eyes. Just when he was trying hard to catch her attention, Master returned.

Looking just as he was eight years ago, who exactly is this master? How will Sengo chase after his love now that Master has returned?
