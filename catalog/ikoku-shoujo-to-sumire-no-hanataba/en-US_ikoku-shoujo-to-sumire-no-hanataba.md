## Sinopse

Masaki Ryou was sent with his older sister to clean up Hiijii-san's mansion. While he was there, Ryou found a water well and accidentally fell into it. As he regained consciousness, he meets this girl named Rose who has been supposedly expecting him, and realizes that he is in pre-modern England.
