    "sinopse": "Meet Kento Oonari, salaryman in hell. Overworked by his bosses, his head surely whirled. He dies, but meets up with a god called Raidel who tells him that he'll be sent to a new world.\n\nKento is fairly cautious - he's read this before. And so, to the god, he begs for one thing: \"I just want to live a slow life, nothing more. Just give me a house and a skill for farming.\"\n\nSo Kento is sent to a medieval age to live a nice, slow life. But what a surprise! The god gave him the powers of a Great Sage! And Kento used magic in front of commoner eyes!\n\n(Source: MU)",
