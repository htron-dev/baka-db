## Sinopse

Kanami used to live a happy life. A normal family with a kind, older brother. This changed when her parents died in a car accident. Her once kind brother became cold and cruel, she started being bullied for not having parents at school, and distant relatives tried to take advantage of her and her brother for their inheritance money.

By pure coincidence, she meets a young man who sees her crying alone at a park. After talking with him, he offers, "Hey, why don't you rent me?"

This is the story of Kanami, as her involvement with her rental big brother helps her become a better person as well as help her reach her goal of getting along with her biological brother again.
