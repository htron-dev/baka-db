    "sinopse": "Plain-faced mangaka Rui Kijima has no time for love. Despite her editor's claims that romance would be a helpful experience, she would much rather spend her time drawing. That is, until \"romance\" literally comes knocking on her door.\n\nKeigo Azuma is the CEO of a money-lending company, and it just so happens that Rui is the guarantor of her friend who fled, leaving behind a sixty thousand dollar debt. Unable to afford such a hefty price, she promises to pay the amount in full very soon. But Keigo is only willing to postpone if she pays right then and there—with her body.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
