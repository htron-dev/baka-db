## Sinopse

In a place between somewhere and nowhere, a man who calls himself "God" awaits people on the verge of death. He meets the good, the bad, and everyone in between, and allows them to reflect on their lives. Some require comfort, while others repent or regret their actions. God provides a fair judgment to all before they can pass on to the other side.

Life waits for no one. Still, people take living for granted while they are still in this world. But all men must die when their time comes. Philosophical and thought-provoking, About Death looks into concepts of life and death through the various experiences of dying people and their individual encounters with God.
