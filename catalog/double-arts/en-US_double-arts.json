    "sinopse": "A boy and a girl are forced to join hands for all eternity!? In a land ravaged by an epidemic known as \"Troy,\" the only people with healing arts capable of stopping the seizures caused by the disease are the Sisters. Although they have a high resistance to the disease, they are searching for a person who is truly immune, if they exist, so that they can find a cure. The main character is Sister Elraine, one of the Sisters who becomes infected with Troy. But, when she touches Kiri, a seemingly ordinary boy, her seizures stop. Could he be the one!?\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Island",
