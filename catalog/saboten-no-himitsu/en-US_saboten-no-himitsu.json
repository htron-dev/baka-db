The problem is that Kyohei is a clueless, dense guy who doesn't know what love is! She always tries to show him how she really feels, but fails. Kyohei even calls her a \"cactus alien\" for being prickly to him, but Miku has her reasons. Kyohei just doesn't get it! Will Kyohei ever find out about Miku's true feelings?!\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 3: Sono Saki no Sweet\nVolume 4: Okosama Brat",
