## Sinopse

Miku Yamada has been in love with Kyohei Fujioka since middle school. She tried so hard to become pretty and finally got close enough to Kyohei. The problem is that Kyohei is a clueless, dense guy who doesn't know what love is! She always tries to show him how she really feels, but fails. Kyohei even calls her a "cactus alien" for being prickly to him, but Miku has her reasons. Kyohei just doesn't get it! Will Kyohei ever find out about Miku's true feelings?!
