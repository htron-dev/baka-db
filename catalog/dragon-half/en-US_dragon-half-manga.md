## Sinopse

A young girl named Mink has fallen for the dreamy Dick Saucer, a famous idol. There's only one problem: Dick's not just an idol—he's a dragon slayer, too...and Mink is half dragon! To solve this conundrum, Mink and her friends must set out on a playful quest to destroy the Demon Lord Azetodeth and gain a potion that will make Mink completely human! Will Mink's love finally be requited or this doomed to be a fetch quest failure?
