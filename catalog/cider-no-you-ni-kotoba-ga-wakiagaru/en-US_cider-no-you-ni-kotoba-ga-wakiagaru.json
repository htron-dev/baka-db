    "sinopse": "The visual features the tagline, \"I met you in my 17th summer ...\" The \"boy-meets-girl\" story depicts how words and music bridge the gap between Cherry, a boy who is terrible at communicating with other people, and Smile, a girl who hides behind a mask. They meet in a mundane suburban shopping mall in a provincial city.\n\nCherry always wears headphones and puts the feelings he cannot utter into his hobby, Japanese haiku poems. Smile always wears a mask to conceal her large front teeth, for which she has dental braces. As a popular video star, she streams a video about seeking \"cuteness.\"\n\n(Source: ANN)",
