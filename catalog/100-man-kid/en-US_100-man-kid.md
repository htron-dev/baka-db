## Sinopse

Nikaidou Hiroshi and his two brothers each inherit 100 million yen. Who will become the successor to the Nikaidou Tycoon? None other than the son that uses the money the best. So how does young Hiroshi use his money well? Stocks? Of course not. He goes straight down to Vegas and starts playing poker.
