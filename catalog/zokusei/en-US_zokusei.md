## Sinopse

Zokusei follows the adventures of a male (who seems to change every few chapters) and a short, humorous, but mostly ecchi encounter with the various females he meets, whether it's in school, in the class room, or in the nurse's office. Each chapter is a mere 9-13 pages, and contains more fan service than needed!
