## Sinopse

When an innocent pixy named "Pacifica" appears and attaches herself to young rapscallions Tatsuki and Shin, the government and a host of nefarious characters all want to kidnap her for their personal gain! The last surviving member of the royal family thinks Pacifica will grant him eternal life. A genie claims, "Pixies are the treasures of the world, with the poor to integrate anything and everything in the universe." Our heroes, frankly, care more about where their next gourmet meal is coming from. But it's hard to travel incognito when you're accompanied by a pretty little pixy with huge, translucent, shimmering wings! (Source: Viz)
