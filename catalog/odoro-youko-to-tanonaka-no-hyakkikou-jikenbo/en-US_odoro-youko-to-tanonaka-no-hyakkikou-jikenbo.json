    "sinopse": "Kondou Youko has strangely pale eyes, just like her grandmother did before her. On her 17th birthday, she begins to see strange things that can't be seen by anyone around her. The first thing she sees is a child with a bandage over his eyes, who seems to be asking her for something. Is his situation merely tragic, or is his presence possibly dangerous for Youko?\n\nYouko meets a college student, Tanonaka Kyouichi, who studies urban legends, folklore, and things of that nature. He believes her account of the strange child and helps her try to figure out what to do about him. After this first encounter that brings them together, Youko and Tanonaka begin to encounter all kinds of supernatural events together. With Youko's spiritual sight and Tanonaka's knowledge, they make an excellent team!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
