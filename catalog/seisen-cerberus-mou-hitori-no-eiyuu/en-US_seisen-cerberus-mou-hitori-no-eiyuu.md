## Sinopse

Wars raged between various countries in this epic story, where dragons, demons, and mages roamed the world. When he was just a baby, Allen's village was attacked by a lone, but powerful mage, who destroyed the village in one sweep. Allen was the only survivor. He was found in the clutches of his dead mother by a pack of wolf-men, who raised Allen as if he was their actual son. The now 17-year-old Allen ventures into the world alone, pursuing, on an adventure, to find peace and love in a world filled with chaos and evil.
