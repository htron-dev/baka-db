## Sinopse

Endou Maya is a high school girl who has the looks of a model but always ends up getting nervous and making ugly faces in front of the camera. But whenever it's time to eat lunch at the modeling agency, she becomes lively again! That's because she gets to see Pierre, the lunchbox seller, who she's actually in love with! Will something happen between them? And what will Pierre think?
