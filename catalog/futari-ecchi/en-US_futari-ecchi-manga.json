    "sinopse": "An excellent and very educational series. About a newlywed couple who are virgins and their comedic ups and downs in learning how to have sex. Not really a hentai, though there are scenes which can be called hentai. Tastefully rendered taboo themes. A funny \"how to\" guide for sex illiterate and experts.\n\n(Source: MU)",
