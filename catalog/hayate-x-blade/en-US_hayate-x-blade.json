Students in the special \"Sword Bearer\" program compete in a school-wide battle known as the Star Stealing, striving to win both money and fame.\n\nEnter Kurogane Hayate. With her sister Nagi recovering from a lingering injury, the spunky and cheerful Hayate must take her place at the Academy until Nagi is well enough to return. When Hayate learns of the mountain of debt her old orphanage, the Dandelion Garden, owes to Yakuza loan sharks, she decides to become a sword-bearer and win the Star Stealing.\n\nThere's just one problem... she needs a partner to compete and the one girl Hayate has her eye on wants nothing to do with her!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
