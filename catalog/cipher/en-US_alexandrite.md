## Sinopse

This story is a spinoff from Narita Minako-sensei's own series "Cipher" where Siva's friend Alex Levine is now the main character. Ever since Alex was young, he has harbored a complex about his extremely pretty face. People are always comparing him to a girl, so to combat this image, he has thrown himself into practicing martial arts. One day, though, he is scouted by someone to become a fashion model and thus begins Alex's tale of growth and romance!

As a sidenote, for the "Cipher" fans out there, Siva, Cipher, and Anise also make cameos in the series, so you can find out a little bit about what happened to them as well!
