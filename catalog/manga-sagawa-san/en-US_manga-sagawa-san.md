## Sinopse

Taken from kotonoha:
In the song "Too Much Blood," Mick Jagger asked, "Do you remember Japanese student kill and ate his girlfriend in Paris?" That world-wide-known cannibal is Kazumasa Sagawa. He was eventually released by French authorities because he was diagnosed with a mental disorder. He was sent to Japan, but Japanese psychologists couldn't find anything wrong with his mental condition, so he went free! In his own comic, written and drawn by himself, Sagawa details the murder and the banquet just like a gourmet guide. "The flesh of her butt is incredibly soft and juicy like genuine filet." Does it make you feel rush into a rest room or Sizzler?

Warning: This manga contains very disturbing scenes such as cannibalism, mutilation, desmembering, etc. (In short: Guro) READ AT CAUTION!
