## Sinopse

Naomi Kosugi is an unremarkable girl in all aspects, but she sports blonde hair that invites the wrath of her HR teacher, Ryuuhei Hoshida, a large and rough guy who often threatens to beat up his students. But Naomi takes in all of Hoshida sensei's yelling and threats with a smile and seems to invite more with her actions.
