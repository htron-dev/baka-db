    "sinopse": "From a small lake nestled in a secluded forest far from the edge of town something strange emerged one day: Three young girls. The three girls, Shem, Hamu and Japheth, are sisters from another world. Equipped with magical powers, they are charged with saving all the creatures of Earth from becoming extinct. However, there is someone or something sinister trying to stop them. While saving our world from destruction, these sisters live like normal human girls: They go to school, work at a flower shop, hang around with friends and even fall in love...\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
