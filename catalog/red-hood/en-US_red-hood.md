## Sinopse

Gold, a witch hunter, is targeted by wolves who mistake him for a witch's servant because of the red hood he wears. Realizing that they share his objective, Gold teams up with the werewolf Fen to kill the witch. Fen is none too pleased at first, because most of the benefits from this partnership seem to come to Gold, who can also gain healing powers by "attaining bodily fluids" from Fen...

How will this unlikely duo fare on their quest together?
