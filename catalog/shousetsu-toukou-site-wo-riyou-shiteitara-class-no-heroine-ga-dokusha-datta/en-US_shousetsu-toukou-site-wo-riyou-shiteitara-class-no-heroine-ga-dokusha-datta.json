Routa Rindou is a writer on Narima who receives a merciless review one day from a reader named \"AKNY.\" Wallowing in his misery, he happens across a lost phone in his classroom and sees the letters \"AKNY\" flash across its screen. Still in shock, Routa's eyes widen even further when the queen of the school, Himeko Akaneya, comes in and declares, \"Ah, that's my cellphone!\" WHAAAT?!\n\n(Source: MU)",
