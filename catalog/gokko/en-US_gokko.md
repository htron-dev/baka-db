## Sinopse

Rambunctious daughter Yoyoko spends her days with her otaku single father. With his annoying childhood friend-turned-cop Machi, they almost look like a real family. If only these happy days could last forever… But as the literal skeletons in the closet are revealed, will their bond be strong enough to overcome the odds? Or have they just been playing pretend...

Taking inspiration from his own experience as a parent, Hiroyuki Shouji weaves a story that's simultaneously funny, thought-provoking, and tragic!
