If only these happy days could last forever… But as the literal skeletons in the closet are revealed, will their bond be strong enough to overcome the odds? Or have they just been playing pretend...\n\nTaking inspiration from his own experience as a parent, Hiroyuki Shouji weaves a story that's simultaneously funny, thought-provoking, and tragic!\n\n(Source: MU)",
