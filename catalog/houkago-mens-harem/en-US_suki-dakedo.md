## Sinopse

Katsuragi and Aoba are not exactly what you might call the best of friends; in fact, Aoba can't stand his colleague and it's all because Katsuragi seems to get everything he wants. Now, Aoba wants to apply for the Student Council, but he has a problem: he needs the recommendation from an active member of the commitee and Katsuragi is his last hope. Will Aoba be willing to pay the price for that?
