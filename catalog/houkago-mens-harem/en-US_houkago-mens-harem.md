## Sinopse

Nagato Aoba enters the student council after much effort and heartache (Suki Dakedo!) but at what cost? Not liked by the rest of the council, insesantly persued by Yura, and a hidden relationship with Maki, seems like enough trouble, but... is there more looming his way? You bet it is! Watch out Aoba!!
