## Sinopse

Conor, a Korean-American, lives in a city where same-sex marriage has been legalized, but where racist and homophobic hate crimes are still frequent. He joins a band with the blonde hair, blue-eyed Simon and the two go on to create their own "dark heaven" in an abandoned church. Feelings develop between the pair, but light cannot dwell with dark, and their time together will soon come to an end...
