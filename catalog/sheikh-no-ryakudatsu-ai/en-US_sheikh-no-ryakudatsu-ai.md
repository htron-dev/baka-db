## Sinopse

Kidnapped by rebels, Belle Winters discovers her rescuer is Rafiq al Akhtar, Sovereign Prince of the desert kingdom of Q'aroum. Whisked away to his exotic palace, Rafiq expects her to show her gratitude...by marrying him!

Rafiq demands Belle perform all her royal duties--both in public and in private. Soon she succumbs to the sultry heat of the desert and to Rafiq's seduction. Belle is no longer an unwilling wife, now she is the sheikh's very willing lover....

Surrender To The Sheikh: He's proud, passionate, primal--dare she surrender to the Sheikh?
