## Sinopse

Mitsui Tooru works for a large company, but all he really wants to do is spend his days relaxing at hot springs. So when his boss tells him to do some real work for once and pull in a certain customer, however he can, Tooru takes it as his chance to visit a hot spring on the company dime! And while he's at it, maybe he'll invite along the new girl who's apparently been constipated lately... Little does he know, the company he's supposed to be meeting with has already proven difficult and rejected previous offers, and this is just Tooru's boss's way of creating an excuse to fire him!
