## Sinopse

Sawada can't take his eyes off of Tsuji, a quiet classmate who seems to have been closing himself off to everyone. One day, Sawada bumps into Tsuji and touches the cut on his finger, but Tsuji...moans?? It turns out the reason why Tsuji's been isolating himself because he's hyper-sensitive to other people's touches, so Sawada comes up with a plan: get Tsuji used to touching others, by touching him! With careful after-school practice, Tsuji gets used to touching Sawada's fingers, hands, arms... but how about his heart?
