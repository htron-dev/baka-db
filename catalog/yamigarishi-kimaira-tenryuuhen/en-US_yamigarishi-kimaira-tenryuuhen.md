## Sinopse

Ranzou is a big, tough guy with a motorcycle. After a run-in with a not particularly nice man in distress and a giant cat, he becomes a tough guy with a pet spirit cat, a wrecked motorcycle, and no money to fix it. In an effort to make money, he takes a job that lands him in Taiwan, where he and his cat unfortunately find themselves drawn into some serious trouble with demons.
