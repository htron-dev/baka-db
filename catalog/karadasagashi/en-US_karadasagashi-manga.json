    "sinopse": "A girl named Haruka Mikami confronts her friend Asuka Morisaki, asking her to search for her body. Bewildered, Asuka tells her friends about it, only to discover that Haruka had also asked the same of them. Unable to understand why they would be asked to do such a thing, they assume it is just a prank. But after some strange incidents, they are mysteriously transported to their school at the stroke of midnight.\n\nRealizing that they must find the eight pieces of Haruka's body in order to leave, they begin their search in the school's darkened corridors. Asuka and the others have much more to worry about than simply finding their friend's dismembered corpse, however—a blood-covered girl stalks the hallways and will kill the students if she catches them. If the increasingly desperate group can't find Haruka's body, they will have to repeat the nightmarish event over and over again until their grim task is completed.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
