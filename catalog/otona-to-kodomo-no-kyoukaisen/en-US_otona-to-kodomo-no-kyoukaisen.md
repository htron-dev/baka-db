## Sinopse

Tohru is confused and in deep trouble. After the \'thing\' with Takafumi - a senior high student, Tohru can\'t get him out of his head. Tohru swore that he will wait until Takumi is legally an adult he will not do \'H things\' (perverted things) with him. However, both are finding it hard to keep their urges under control...this is when the line between boy and man becomes conveniently blurred...
