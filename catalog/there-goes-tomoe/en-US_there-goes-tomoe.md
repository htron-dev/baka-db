## Sinopse

After the death of a close friend Tomoe, a former roller skater, joins a famous stunt men troupe, the Green Ship. And also the head of this troupe, Kazusa, becomes her lover. But soon Tomoe has to find out that the Green Ship is a sinister crime organisation and that her dear Kazusa is cold-hearted to kill a human without a blink. This starts a hard fight for Tomoe, not only against the organisation but also to get away from Kazusa, who wants his lover back, dead or alive! A "Romeo and Juliet" type of story. (Source: M-U)
