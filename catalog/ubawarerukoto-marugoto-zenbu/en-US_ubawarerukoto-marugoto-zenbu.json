    "sinopse": "Takao's obsession with big breasts is no secret. In fact, he is so caught up admiring well-endowed women that he remains oblivious of the love for him by his childhood friend, Yoshinaga. When Takao playfully tells Yoshinaga that a girl confessed to him, the latter loses his cool and ends up taking his friend by force. Takao half-heartedly protests every time Yoshinaga touches him, but even as his eyes wander toward buxom women, he is puzzled by his own loyalty to his fiercely possessive and short-tempered friend.\n\nElsewhere, a teenaged Takeharu is haunted by a tragedy: his fisherman father fell off his boat several years ago, and his body was never found. Takeharu's enigmatic cousin Toshizou, once an outstanding young man who traveled across the globe, is currently a jobless vagrant freeloading at Takeharu's place. But to Takeharu's surprise, the very cousin he abhors could hold the solution to his debilitating fear of the sea.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
