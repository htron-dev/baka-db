    "sinopse": "Nawoki Karasawa is one of the longer-active and more prestigious names in the typically small time, lesser-known world of gag manga. In a genre where art skill is second to just about everything else, Karasawa's dialogue is hilariously sharp and witty.\n\nA gag parody of Shinji Mizushima's immortal \"Mangaka Zankoku Monogatari\" (Karasawa's title only differs by adding \"cho\" [super] to \"zankoku\"), a manga about the dreams, ambitions and suffering of a group of bright young mangaka, Karasawa brilliantly takes the piss out of just about everything involved with being a mangaka. It's lewd, raunchy, endlessly cynical and laugh-out-loud funny.\n\n(Source: One Manga)",
