## Sinopse

Nawoki Karasawa is one of the longer-active and more prestigious names in the typically small time, lesser-known world of gag manga. In a genre where art skill is second to just about everything else, Karasawa's dialogue is hilariously sharp and witty.

A gag parody of Shinji Mizushima's immortal "Mangaka Zankoku Monogatari" (Karasawa's title only differs by adding "cho" [super] to "zankoku"), a manga about the dreams, ambitions and suffering of a group of bright young mangaka, Karasawa brilliantly takes the piss out of just about everything involved with being a mangaka. It's lewd, raunchy, endlessly cynical and laugh-out-loud funny.
