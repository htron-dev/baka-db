    "sinopse": "Asuka Tsukasa has an irrational fear of animals, especially dogs, which makes studying abroad in London, city of dog lovers, a bit of a challenge for him. There, in his vanished mother's hometown, he hopes to find a clue to her whereabouts and to meet the mysterious smiling girl from his dreams. But life only gets harder for this zoophobe when he's invited to join a secret organization that seeks to coexist with fantastical beasts and protect the world from the ones that go out of control. At least he gets to meet that girl, though she turns out to be a giant, snarling dog, who wants nothing more than to tear him to shreds!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
