    "sinopse": "This series weaves a strange, surreal, and often dark comedy resplendent with ruffles and lace. It is on the surface a farce about a young girl travelling with her lover, some sort of bear-type creature, but as to be expected of Ikuhara it's multi-layered. The series is being endorsed by Baby the Stars Shine Bright, the leading name in Japanese lolita fashion, and the characters often wear clothes based off of those from the company.\n\n(Source: Transcendence)",
