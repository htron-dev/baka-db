    "sinopse": "\"Ryuugaeri\"—In the present day, where people turn back into dragons has become an ordinary matter.\n\nOn his way home, a former-human dragon, Tsukumo, suddenly fell in front of Murasaki. He then reluctantly allows Tsukumo, who no longer has a place to live, to freeload at his home. However, at midnight, Murasaki was attacked by Tsukumo, who was asleep while crying \"I'm lonely?!\" For the first time in his life, the weredragon reaches his hand to break open the heart of the lonely high school student whom was shrouded in darkness—this is a touching story about living together.\n\n(Source: Houbunsha, translated)",
