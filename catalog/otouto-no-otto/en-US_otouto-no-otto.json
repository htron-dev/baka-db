    "sinopse": "Otouto no Otto is a family drama that begins with the suspicious arrival of Mike, a Canadian who has come to pay respects to the family of his recently deceased Japanese husband Ryouji, whose only remaining immediate family member is Yaichi—his identical twin brother. As Mike gets accustomed to Japanese morals and the surprising idiosyncrasies of living with Yaichi and his daughter Kana, the sleepy Japanese suburb also learns the true meaning of family.\n\n(Source: Massive Goods)",
