    "sinopse": "The Hari Hari Island Adventure Rally is just about to start! Hello Kitty, Keroppi, and other Sanrio favorites have gathered in fantastical cars for an endurance race around the island’s many obstacles. Sam and Chip think their vehicle has what it takes to win the checkered flag, but after a late start and a few unfortunate accidents, can this plucky duo survive the odds and pull off a victory?\n\n(Source: Shiteater Fansubs)",
