    "sinopse": "\"I really want to become Rui’s protector!\" Super introvert Souichirou frequently says this. However, whenever he listens to \"Rocky\"´s song, he immediately has a 180° change in his character (pervert)! Rui, who is always surrounded by guys who only care about a girl's figure and looks, wishes to meet a true prince one day, but sadly most are...? Would prevail love this time also...?!\n\n(Source: Shoujo Crusade)\n\nIncluded one-shots: Irogonomi na Kareshi no Jouken, Dream",
