Having just transferred into Nanjou High's part-time evening classes, he picks a fight with the full-time students' baseball club, a favorite for Koushien who are monopolizing the playing grounds. In order to challenge the full-time baseball club on equal footing, Akira will aim for Jinguu, the home of \"the other Koushien\" for part-time high school students!\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Inochi no Mound, Mou Hitotsu no Koushien",
