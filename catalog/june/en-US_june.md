## Sinopse

Commonly acknowledged as a genius biologist, Dr. Gangjae Lee has a conceited and blunt personality that tends to push people away. But that doesn't bother him since he is a happy husband who has been married for 7 years to Jaehee, a woman whose astonishing beauty and sexiness captivates men.

While living a double life as a college research professor, Dr. Lee secretly participates in a human cloning project run by Dr. Suh. Through numerous trials and errors, and thousands of experiments, a few clones are born. But these miracles of science are sub-quality clones whose life spans don't stretch much past 7 years.

Although their methods improve, the two doctors give birth to another sub-quality clone, but this one is of Dr. Lee's wife, Jaehee. They call her by three different names: Jaehee, Clone S04, and a name her lover and popular novelist Jinhun gives her, June. Together with Dr. Suh and Jungwoo, and hidden from the eyes of the world with the support of underground financial powers, Dr. Lee devotes himself to this project.

But one day, his wife who he treasures more than his own life, gets brutally murdered and the story takes a different turn...
