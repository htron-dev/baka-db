One day, she finds out that her cousin Daisuke, also her long-time unrequited love interest, has inherited his grandfather’s Japanese confectionery legacy. She quits her job to join him in his new venture but finds herself in a pinch when she starts managing the business! Among other things, there was a random handsome guy who collapses in front of Sakurako’s home! He said, \"That smells good... can I eat it?\" and when he open his eyes he finds himself lip-locked with Sakurako...?! And exciting love comedy about an almost 30 year old woman and a younger man who is like a cat!\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
