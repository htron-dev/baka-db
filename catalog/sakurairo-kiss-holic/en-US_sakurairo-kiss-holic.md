## Sinopse

Sakurako lives a life far away from falling in love, and by the the time she realizes it, she is already 25... One day, she finds out that her cousin Daisuke, also her long-time unrequited love interest, has inherited his grandfather’s Japanese confectionery legacy. She quits her job to join him in his new venture but finds herself in a pinch when she starts managing the business! Among other things, there was a random handsome guy who collapses in front of Sakurako’s home! He said, "That smells good... can I eat it?" and when he open his eyes he finds himself lip-locked with Sakurako...?! And exciting love comedy about an almost 30 year old woman and a younger man who is like a cat!
