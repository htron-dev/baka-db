## Sinopse

Prequel to Digimon Tamers that describes the creation of the Digimon by the Wild Bunch at Palo Alto University.

Mostly deriving from the perspective of Daisy, the story begins with her meeting Jianyu Li, a student from Hong Kong, at the university for the first time, who invites her to Professor Rob McCoy's lab, where the other Wild Bunch members are gathered. There, they gradually help with the creation of a parallel world inside a computer network, inhabited by digital monsters. Dolphin asks for the help of his 10-year-old gamer son, Keith, who eventually creates the rudimentary beings and organizes them by various criteria: abilities, power level, etc.
