## Sinopse

Scriptwriter Akaneya is feeling troubled. He's not sure how to develop a love relationship in a romantic drama. So he heads to a hot spring for inspiration and there he meets the blind masseur Takehisa. Though he's disabled, he is still cheery and adorable. Add an abandoned dog, Yuuzou, into the story and will love blossom!? The courage required to speak out and convey an emotion that "cannot be seen by the naked eye" can be felt in this heartwarming BL story.

Included one-shot: Seishun Kakumo Aoku (Youth, So Blue)
