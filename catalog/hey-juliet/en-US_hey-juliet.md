## Sinopse

A short story by Chieko Hara originally published by Kodansha in 1979-79, and published (recoloured and westernised) in Italy as "Ehi Juliet!" in issues 169-173 of Candy Candy in 1983.

Juliet is a girl still waiting to experience her first love. She's long admired the charming and popular Bob Spencer, but after an 'incident' on the bus her opinion of him has dropped like a stone.
The beautiful Angel, head of the women's acting club to which Juliet belongs, encourages her anyway - sooner or later, she will find a love story just waiting for her.

Angel conspires with George (also called Peter due to an error), the head of the Radio Club, to bring the two together by collaborating on a Radio Play. While working together Juliet tries her hardest, but the fierce criticism and meddling of the jealous Marilyn (who also likes Bob) leads her to doubt her work, and when the drama doesn't work out as planned and has to be remade from scratch, Juliet is mortified.
She flees, but when Bob gives chase and demands to be heard, insisting that she can't give up at the first hurdle, she finds the confidence to give it another chance.
