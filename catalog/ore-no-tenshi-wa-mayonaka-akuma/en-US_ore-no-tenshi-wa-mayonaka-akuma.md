## Sinopse

Good vs. evil, love vs. ...more love?!

Fujiki Tomo is a teacher whose newest transfer student is as cute as an angel. The adorable boy's name is Shiina Kazunari. However, when Fujiki sees something unbelievably cute, his nervousness always frightens it away.

So, Fujiki is working hard to correct the problem for his darling Shiina's sake, but that's when a delinquent steals a kiss from our troubled teacher!

Who is this devilish delinquent, and where did he come from? And why does he bear such a strong resemblance to the angelic Shiina?
