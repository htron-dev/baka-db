## Sinopse

The Izanami High School soccer team is reeling after one of their own, Masaki, is killed unexpectedly in a traffic accident. It seems impossible to fill the gaping hole left in the team by Masaki's death. However, with one player short, they won't be able to go to any of the championships they had all dreamed about before. One day, a mysterious transfer student, Amakusa Kain, tries out for the soccer team, and his skills stun the team's ace! Will Kain be the push they need to move forward from this tragedy as a team and begin once again to chase their championship dreams?
