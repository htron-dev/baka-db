## Sinopse

The story takes place in the year 2029, where Japan leads the list of countries with more radioactive pollution, epidemics, and illegal trafficking in organs as a result of using biological weapons. The "Modern Vampires" are a problem for local police. A former policeman, Hibino, seems to be the only one who can deal with them.
