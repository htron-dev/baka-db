    "sinopse": "In Tomoko Yamashita's Dining Bar Akira, romantic passions battle with cool logic behind kitchen doors. There's always drama when you're trying to run a busy bar and restaurant. Akira Koji, the manager, is stuck in the middle of it all, trying to keep his cool. Then he gets a late night confession from one of his employees. Not only that, it's a very attractive male employee a full six years younger than him, 26-year-old Torihara. Akira has never considered a homosexual relationship before, but things start to change when he can't get the young man out of his head. Will the two of them be able to remain professional when things start to get serious?\n\n(Source: Netcomics)",
