## Sinopse

In order to follow her dreams and be like her mom, Chika sought out her mom's high school to join the Folk Music Club. However, when she entered the school, the club that her mother made famous no longer existed. Depressed and at a loss for what to do, Chika eventually meets Tenko who wishes to create a band and believes Chika to be the answer. Chika is excited to be able to play in a rock band but... why are the other members all holding string instruments?
