## Sinopse

Mimasaka, a genius with a camera, returns to his university after losing his job to assist one of his former teachers. One day he's suddenly knocked over by the strange and slightly perverted Saki, who professes that he is in love with Mimasaka's gaps. At the mercy of Saki's crazy behavior, Mimasaka oddly finds himself comforted by the passionate gaze of Saki through his camera. How long before their encounter through the viewfinder will lead them to love...? A sensitive boys love romance seen through the lens of a camera.
