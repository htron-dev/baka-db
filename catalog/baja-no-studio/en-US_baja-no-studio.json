    "sinopse": "\"My name is Baja. That's what everyone calls me, so it's probably Baja. I came here from the outside world when I was little. As for what happened when I was born, I don't remember much of it.\"\n\nKohata Anime Studio is a place full of dreams where animation is made. Baja was raised in this studio by the people who create animation. Floating in a pond outside is his friend the duck. Baja enjoys a fun and blissful daily life. One night, when all the people are no longer at the studio, Baja takes a peek outside and finds that his duck friend is being attacked by a cat. Will Baja be able to save his friend? A wondrous night adventure begins!\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
