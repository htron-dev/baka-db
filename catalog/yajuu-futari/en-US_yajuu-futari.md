Yukari and Haruhi are the same age, with Ruka being a little younger, but they have all been friends since childhood. Though they have just been good friends until now, Haruhi suddenly confesses his love to Yukari and begins dating her. But then Ruka also muscles his way in on her. As for Yukari - well, she just can't make up her mind! Calm days have turned into a series of stormy events for this threesome! (Source: B-U)
