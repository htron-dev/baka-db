    "sinopse": "\"I have lived the past twenty years enshrouded in fat and negative energy.\" Marina is a gloomy young woman who has failed every diet she has ever tried and can't make friends, much less a boyfriend. But, one night, she encounters a gorgeous man... With a voice as gentle as a beautiful flower, he whispers to her words as sweet as honey: \"Why don't you take a chance with me? I'll make your wish come true.\" Did God take pity on her and send an angel to grant her wish?! Is the man extending this helping hand to our pudgy Cinderella truly an angel? Or is he not what he seems? Strap in for this thrilling romantic comedy about a hot rich boy and a pessimistic chubby girl!!\n\n(Source: Manga Box)",
