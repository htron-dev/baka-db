    "sinopse": "Hiroki, the restless grandson of the landlord, is hugely smitten with one of the apartment tenants, Izumi. His obsession and rapidly escalating \"urges\" are almost enough to drive him insane. In fact, the probably has gone over the edge already. After all, in the throes of his desire-driven madness, he's gone and stolen a very \"private and intimate\" item from Izumi!\n\nIn another story, a lovesick teen writes letters to himself just to get regular visits from the mailman he longs for. Meanwhile, a work-at-home employee accepts job assignments, with sex as a collateral. But one day, his male housekeeper—whom he has a crush on—walks in during one of his \"payment\" sessions.\n\nThese and other eccentric, sometimes shocking and often amusing stories comprise this quirky manga anthology from the mind of Rize Shinba.\n\n(Source: Juné)",
