Based on a novel, this Korean manhwa focuses on heroine Jeong Won Yun, a strong girl who knows self defense. She reports a hit and run case which then disrupts the family of one of the other main characters, Hui Won. He constantly abuses her whilst he falls in love with her along the way; however, she has a boyfriend—Eun Gyu—who is the singer of an ongoing band.
