    "sinopse": "The locomotive called the Rainbow Stone Train runs, not on electricity, but on the energy source called, \"Rainbow Stone.\" Inside, the train is split; from the extremely high class Evening carriage, to the average Afternoon carriage, and finally, to the cheap, but cramped and noisy, Morning carriage.\n\nEmployed as a crew member of Morning, Toky Towy struggles daily by the side of his strict superior while going through various encounters and farewells again and again.\n\n(Source: MU)",
