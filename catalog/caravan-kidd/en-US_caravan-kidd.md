## Sinopse

Wataru ran away from home to find something. Something fun, something exciting, something different. What he found was all three, with emphasis on "different"! Mian Toris is an enigma, an endearing, buxom redhead with a big sword and a penchant for dog collars and trouble! All the fleets of Helgebard are after her lovely tail, and she's drafted Wataru and his sidekick Babo to be her companions for the escape run. The authorities claim she's the harbinger of Armageddon, with aspirations to destroy the whole planet, but from where Wataru is sitting, she's the answer to his prayers!
