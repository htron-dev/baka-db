    "sinopse": "White is passion, a color that won’t yield to even the slightest imperfection.\n\nFrom manga artist Suguro Chayamachi comes BLANC, a collection of six very unique short stories.\n\nA young man takes it upon himself to find a lost cat’s home. Two delinquents bond after one has a near-death experience. A boy discovers the joys and pains of first love. One punk makes a dark decision to cover up his tracks. A familiar face has one teenager remembring the past. At a Yakuza funeral, loyalty to a friend struggles with loyalty to the whole.\n\nChayamachi’s stories explore that which makes humans so imperfect: friendship, love, and heartbreaking regret.\n\n(Source: DMG)",
