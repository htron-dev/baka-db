## Sinopse

As the sole inhabitant of an enormous mansion, Coco would be utterly alone if not for her beloved black cat Kuro. Although he has his quirks, the two are an inseparable pair and enjoy fun-filled adventures on a daily basis.

Lulled into bliss by these idyllic days, Coco is completely unaware of the harrowing reality that surrounds her. For everyone else in her town, life is filled with dread and unease. They fear the sinister forces enveloping their town, but they are also afraid of Coco and Kuro. Ignorant of the situation, Coco lives out her peaceful days with Kuro, but her days of blissful ignorance may be quickly coming to an end...
