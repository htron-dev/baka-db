The government decides to limit trade to an artificial island of Dejima created off Okinawa. The encounter of species from other worlds creates tensions on the island. A special force, made up of humans and aliens, is created to maintain order in Dejima: the Dragon Gun. During a patrol, the officer Σ (Sigma) stopped a lorry carrying illegal goods. Inside is a Mumère, a species coming from a marine planet, which ends its life to protect a heavy secret. This is the beginning of a long investigation for the officer Σ.",
