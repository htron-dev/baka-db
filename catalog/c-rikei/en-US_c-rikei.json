But when it comes to thinking of a demo of their club activities, no one really has any ideas of what would attract people. The eccentric club president Tonoe decides on a demonstration of soldering, which appears to be a spectacular failure. However, soon they are welcoming two new club members to their little cluttered clubroom! Join the club as they face the new year together.",
