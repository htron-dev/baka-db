    "sinopse": "Kataoka (male) and Sato (female) have been friends since they were little. Kataoka has much better hearing than the average human, and he says Sato's voice is the most noisy of all. He has grown into a teenager able to hear everything from far around him—the good and bad. Now that the two of them are teenagers, Sato is affiliated with the school newspaper club, and Kataoka has mostly isolated himself. When the newspaper club decides to look into the truth behind some 'supernatural' rumors, Sato manages to convince Kataoka to lend the club his abilities.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
