## Sinopse

This world we live in, the "Apparent World" had another counterpart since long before the cyber age. From ancient times, people referred to it as the "Unseen World."

Taro, Makoto and Masayuki are three junior high school boys who live in Suiten, a small town in a remote region of Northern Kyushu. Each one experienced a trauma in their childhood they could not erase. Because of this, or of other reasons, they all learned to traverse to the Unseen World, by slipping their souls.

Ghosts dwelling in the Unseen World, did never manifest in the Apparent World. However, the Unseen World was going through an adverse change.

And now, that change is starting to extend into the Apparent World...
