    "sinopse": "The Kaitou Royal is a group of thieves who steal from the rich and wicked and give back to the people, somewhat like a modern day Robin Hood. The phantom thieves currently consist of two childhood friends: Takaya, who uses brute strength to acquire his target, and Hayato, who uses his intelligence to quietly steal the item. Kaitou Royal used to be a trio until the third member, Ubuka who is extremely beautiful, left to work with another group. Takaya and Hayato’s latest mission reveals a clue about the Rosetta Kingdom which the old trio seems to have some kind of connection to. Will the old friends work together to find the truth or will the differences keep them rivals?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
