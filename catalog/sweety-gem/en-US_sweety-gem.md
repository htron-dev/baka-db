One upon a time ... A pretty princess has just been born in the kingdom of Party Land. The three fairies are invited to her baptism. When they are filling her benefits, the malicious witch excluded from the festival launches a curse against the poor child... The day of her fifteenth birthday, the princess Rubis crunches in a poisoned apple and is captived in a quite particular jewel: the Sweety Gem.
