## Sinopse

Back in high school days, Makoto fell for Natsume (a glassed, short-haired girl) at the first dialogue with her. He even applied for a less competitive major of the same college just to be with her, but unfortunately she was not admitted. Makoto helped Natsume to retake the exam and the two became a couple naturally. The story follows small romantic events in their and their close friends' daily lives.
