## Sinopse

Katsuse Rin, a troublesome student that's always breaking the rules ends up falling in love with a member of the school discipline squad, Kuramare Fukaten. They run into some problems when Katsuse wants to be more open about their relationship, but Kuramare does not want his school life to be affected by his private life. Will Katsuse and Kuramare be able to overcome this and be the happy hugging, kissing, dating couple that Katsuse wants, or will Kuramare be afraid to let himself be caught by the students that look up to him, forcing Katsuse to move on with someone else?
