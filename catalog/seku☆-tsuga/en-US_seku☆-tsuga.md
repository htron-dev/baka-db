## Sinopse

Hikari (Ω) works in the night business and only cares about money. One day, salaryman Dan Seiroudou (α) asks Hikari to give a farewell gift to his boss, who was Hikari's regular client and is now transferring to a different unit. Since his best client and money source is leaving, Hikari wanted to catch Seiroudou, but they unexpectedly cause each other's heat and end up becoming mates during intercourse. It's not much of a deal for Hikari... but the serious Seiroudou wants to get married!
