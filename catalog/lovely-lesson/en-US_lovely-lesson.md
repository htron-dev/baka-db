## Sinopse

Do you have inferiority complex? Were you broken hearted or dumped? Perhaps you are not pretty enough no matter what you do? Then meet Yuhri, a high school goods storekeeper who can make you pretty just by her words. What will happen when she meets Makoto, a guy who happens to have the same "beauty healing" like her?
