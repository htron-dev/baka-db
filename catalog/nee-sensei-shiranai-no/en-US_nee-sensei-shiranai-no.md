## Sinopse

Hana is a shoujo manga artist who fell in love at first sight with Riichi, a handsome hairdresser who was just passing by, and they decided to date! It's normal for Hana to seclude herself when she's working on a manuscript, and she's not the ideal image of a girlfriend, but it seems that Riichi loves that side of her?
