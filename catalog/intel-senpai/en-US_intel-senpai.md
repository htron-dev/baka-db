## Sinopse

Takamizawa Shinichi has just transferred schools and is staying at the male dorm with his new friend Kato Masaya who is showing him around. He tells Takamizawa that he needs to pay his respects to Intel who oversees the male dorm housing. It turns out that Intel is a person who looks to be a pretty girl who seems almost machine-like. She's able to use her hair to fly, defeat a group of bank robbers and read the contents of a game just by scanning the CD. Although Intel has some human aspects, Takamizawa is puzzled by the truth behind Intel and, whether he wants to or not, he's about to find out more.
