    "sinopse": "About to freeze to death on a day of heavy snow, Kento is saved by his neighbor Soushi. Dressed all in black, taciturn and scary-looking, Soushi seems hard to approach, but his eyes, almost hidden by his long hair, shine as if pleading for something. After that day, the two of them end up eating together every day for one year. Kento, while hiding the fact that he's gay, doesn't want the peaceful and happy time they share to come to an end. Can he keep a lid on his feelings...?!\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)",
