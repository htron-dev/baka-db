    "sinopse": "High school student Nanao has been having a series of reoccurring dreams about a German soldier standing alone in the middle of a battlefield. After his parents' tragic death, Nanao transfers to a new school and is immediately drawn to Haruka, a student who looks suspiciously like the soldier in his dreams. But Haruka's not very friendly... and to make matters even worse, he seems to be already involved with a boy from a neighboring school. When Nanao tells both boys about his dreams, they seem unnerved. Do they just think he's crazy, or is it possibly that they share them?\n\n(Source: DokiDoki Scanlations)",
