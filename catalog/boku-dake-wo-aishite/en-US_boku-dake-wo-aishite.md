## Sinopse

Ali's goal is buying a house to make her mother happy, which is why she became a model—to earn her nest egg. One day, she receives news that her uncle died and left his estate to her! There's one condition she has to meet, which is that she must marry within a month of his death. She decides a marriage of convenience is the answer, so she proposes a deal to window cleaner Jethro. He then gives her a piercing stare, looking totally different from his usual sweet self, and she wonders who he really is.
