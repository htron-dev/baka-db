## Sinopse

A new university graduate ventures into the city seeking housing and job. With his low budget, he found a ridiculously cheap place at only 9800 yen a month. After meeting the beautiful and young landlady, he immediately took the offer without further consideration. Unfortunately for him, it seems the mansion is truly a place for vampires, zombies, snow ladies werewolves, etc.

Welcome to Magetsukan Kitan, a semi-harem romance comedy with heavy ecchi that borders on hentai.
