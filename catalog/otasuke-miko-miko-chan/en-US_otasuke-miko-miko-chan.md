## Sinopse

Ayumu Mikoshiba is a boy in junior high whose family runs an old shrine with few worshipers. In an effort to revive the shrine, Ayumu's parents decide he'll be the next in a long line of magical girls in the Mikoshiba family. Together with Fuu-chan, a small fox-like mascot character, Ayumu protects the peace of his town while cross-dressing.
