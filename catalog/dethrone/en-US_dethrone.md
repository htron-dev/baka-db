## Sinopse

There exists a martial arts contest in Japan that is of no concern to boys. Girls who possess the Dragon Queen`s spirit gather at a special academy. The goal - fighting each other to make the soul of the Dragon Queen one once more. How? Why? By fondling their defeated opponent`s breasts, of course!
