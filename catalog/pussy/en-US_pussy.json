The subject of the film is images taken from Screw, a pornographic tabloid newspaper, editions of which Tanaami bought from newspaper stands in New York during his trip in 1969. He color printed the black-and-white photographs to apply different colors for psychedelic effect.\n\n(Source: Collaborative Cataloging Japan)",
