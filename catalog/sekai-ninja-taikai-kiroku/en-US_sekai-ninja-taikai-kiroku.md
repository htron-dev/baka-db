## Sinopse

For some unknown reason, which is apparently connected to something called the "World Ninja Record," high school freshman Tatsuko Yaezaka is being targeted by ninjas. Moreover, all of these ninjas are representative "Iga" from various countries. Thanks to her childhood friend, Japan's Iga, Tatsuko is an expert in defeating ninjas. However, she might not be able to overcome the craftiness of America's Iga.
