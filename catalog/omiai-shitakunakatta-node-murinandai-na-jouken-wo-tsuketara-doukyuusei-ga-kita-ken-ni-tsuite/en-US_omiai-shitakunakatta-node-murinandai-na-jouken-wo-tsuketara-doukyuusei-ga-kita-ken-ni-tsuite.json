    "sinopse": "One day, Yuzuru Takasegawa—a first-year high school student—is urged by his grandfather to go to an arranged marriage meeting, insisting that he wants to see his great-grandson before he dies.\n\nHowever, not wanting to bear the weight of a fiancée at the tender age of a freshman in high school, Yuzuru tries to avoid the arranged marriage meeting by imposing an irrational condition. \"If she is blonde-haired, blue-eyed, fair-skinned, etc, only then I will think about the marriage.\"\n\nBut somehow, he finds the girl who meets the conditions that Yuzuru has put out, and he reluctantly ends up going to matchmaking only once. And on the day of matchmaking, Arisa Yukishiro, a beautiful girl with reputation at school, shows up on the scene. Upon hearing her story, it seems she was also reluctantly made to go on matchmaking. Therefore, the two of them try to prevent themselves from further marriage proposals with their false \"engagement.\" And so, as they play the role of fake lovers, they find themselves in love with each other and become real lovers.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
