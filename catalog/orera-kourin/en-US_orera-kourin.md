## Sinopse

From Chibi Manga:
The everyday misfortunes that occur are from her prayers to God. She believed that her parents and the sister that she loved so much died because of her unhappy predisposition. She can’t even make friends, but all she does is just continue to pray everyday…
And then one day, she met Koini who is invincible at fighting and Kinzou who is invincible against love and was told “we will protect you”!?
This is a high tension love comedy.
