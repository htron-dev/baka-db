## Sinopse

Sawatari Fu, also known as Potte, recently moved to her late father's hometown and is restarting her life at her new school. She is typically nervous and shy but when it comes to photography, she is extremely passionate, especially since it makes her feel still connected to her dad. Fu becomes close friends with Kaoru, Norie and Maon and they spend the best times of their lives together.
