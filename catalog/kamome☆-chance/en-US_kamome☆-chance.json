    "sinopse": "Sarashina is a single dad, working as a debt collector for a bank. His daughter Fukuno is a confusing but cheerful girl who's in kindergarten and who calls her dad Kamome (Seagull). Sarashina uses a bicycle to travel to each client, but after an incident with damaging an expensive racing bicycle, he finds himself in a situation where he has to train in order to compete in a cycling race.\n\nHe learns that he feels an incredible amount of peace when cycling. As chaotic as his life is with dealing with being a single parent, several love interests with beautiful women and everyday issues from his work, Sarashina needs that calming sensation from competitive cycling.\n\n(Source: MU)",
