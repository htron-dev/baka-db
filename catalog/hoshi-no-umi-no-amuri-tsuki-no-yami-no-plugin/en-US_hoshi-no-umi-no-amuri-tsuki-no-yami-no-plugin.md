## Sinopse

Twenty years ago, the sun began to put out very strong radiation, which soon caused people called 'Adapters' to be born. Adapters have special abilities, known as 'Allergies.' This story follows Amuri, an adolescent Adapter with the Allergy of 'Repulsion,' who has come up to work on a space station along with her fellow young female Adapters, such as Perrier (who has the power of Infiltration) and Suzu (who has the power of Escape).
