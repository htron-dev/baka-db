## Sinopse

Goemon Ishikawa, the legendary king of thieves from the feudal era, has come to know that there is an important treasure being transported from the Imperial Palace to the Kamiyama mansion; an ancient artifact called "moon's melody box" (月詠みの箱). Surprised by the extreme measures taken by the guards of this treasure, his indomitable spirit aches to steal this rare item that once a year can grant one special wish to whoever possesses the box, but it will not be so easy to steal it. Even worse, once it is opened, it will be harder to deal with the unusual contents of the box.
