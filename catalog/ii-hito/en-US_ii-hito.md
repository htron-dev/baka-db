## Sinopse

Yuuji Kitano, a college athlete newly graduated from his university, got a job in a big sports equipment corporation. He soon finds out that he is surrounded by numerous obstacles: gets involved in corporation politics of high level executives; lacks of trust from capable female coworkers; being rotated, promoted, and demoted all around; last but not least, a tough HR manager who's also his landlord. However, no matter how difficult the situation is, he is always optimistic and diligent, and his positive attitude not only motivates people around him but also touches the hearts of his female colleagues.
