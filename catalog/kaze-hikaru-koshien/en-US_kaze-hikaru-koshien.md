## Sinopse

Tamagawa high school's baseball team lost all matches in the first round for years. Yutaka is a tiny boy who joined the team as reserve player and he is good at mimicking. The new coach soon spotted his ability and placed him on an important position - the pitcher. The two slowly help the team to build up their strength and spirit.
