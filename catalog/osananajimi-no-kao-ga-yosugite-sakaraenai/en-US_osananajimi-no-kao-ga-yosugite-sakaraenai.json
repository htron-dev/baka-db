    "sinopse": "Akane, a high school student who loves pretty faces and is an idol otaku, is being pressed by his handsome childhood friend, Harumi. \"Wake me up,\" \"Kiss me,\" \"Stay here.\" Akane can't resist when he's begging, but he's too thick-headed to notice Harumi's affection for him. They are in a state of \"Are they not dating yet?\" because they've been really close to each other since they were young. But at one point, Harumi gets serious and approaches Akane...?!\n\n(Source: Libre, translated)",
