## Sinopse

The actors have arrived ─ an ill young man who is a swordsman and druggist. A suspicious poet has perfect appearance. A girl wants to kill the young man from an assassination group.
The stage has been prepared ─ the world, that has come to an end one time and revived due to a man who has been called “the World King” and the God who has bird’s appearance.
For deadless, living and persuading love, they start a long journey.
Oh, eternita, thus raises the first act!
(From Baroque Garden LJ)
