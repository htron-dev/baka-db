## Sinopse

Nukumori Amane is a cheerful high school girl who lives her life with innocent enthusiasm. In the process, she often inadvertently changes and enriches the lives of the boys around her. In turning a man away from suicide, showing a student council president he doesn't need to be so strict, and many more situations, Amane's sweet, and bubbly girl power makes a difference!
