    "sinopse": "A suspenseful trio of short stories. Psychic Squad Wild Com finds its lead character struggling with the denial of her psychic abilities - powers that could spell life or death for those around her. The Beasts of June is a poetic tale of urban violence, of two free spirits caught in corruption's heartless grasp. Finally, The Eye of the Needle provides a shocking thriller wrapped in the guise of a fame-twisted romance. (Source: Viz)",
