When Luke moves to the new school, he quickly gets charmed by his class-mate Eric. He wants to know him better, so he pretends to be poor at math and asks him for help.

After they start going out, he realizes that his new lover isn't interested in kissing and cuddling or any kind of caress... What stands behind his behavior?
