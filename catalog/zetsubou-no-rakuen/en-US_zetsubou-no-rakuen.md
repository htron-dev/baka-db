## Sinopse

The day of his mother's funeral was in the early summer when he turned 17. That was the same day he met Kyouko Yashiro. During the days he felt restless, she was the one who supported him. As long as she was there, then he could continue to live. In the peak of summer, the boy was taken away to "paradise."
