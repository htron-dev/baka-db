The sole survivor of the attack is Marie's twin brother, Albert. He heads for Versailles in his sister's gown–and instead of continuing life as himself, decides to take his sister's place. Now at the heart of the French royal court, Albert must face the undead horrors as the man who would be queen.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
