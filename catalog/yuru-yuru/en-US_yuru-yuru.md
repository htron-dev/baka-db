## Sinopse

The bond between high school friends is like no other. A trio of high school girls consists of Haruka Arai, the naive but sensitive genius; Yuki Katase, the rational one with a need to keep everything organized; and Misaki Fujikura, the sociable type who gets along with almost everyone. As the three girls go about their daily lives as students, they encounter the different joys that are borne from their shared time inside and outside the classroom. The carefree essence of high school life, accompanied by syrupy-sweet moments of leisure in between, is not to be forgotten—no matter how much time passes by.
