## Sinopse

Densuke just enrolled at the exclusive Zashono academy. He's eager to participate in extra-curricular activities, but he never expected to join the mysterious Eiken club. Strangely enough, every other member is a busty co-ed, and many of the club activities include bikinis. But Densuke isn't interested in anyone but the shy and beautiful Chiharu. Will he overcome this wall of women that stand between him and true love?
