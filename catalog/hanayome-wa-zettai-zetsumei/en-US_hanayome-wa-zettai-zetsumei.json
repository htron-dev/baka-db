    "sinopse": "Because of her little brother's gambling addiction, young Catherine now finds herself shouldering a five-thousand-pound debt. A nurse advises her that if she were to marry a death-row inmate the debt would be absolved, and that it would be better than becoming the mistress of an old nobleman. with no other options left, she goes to the prison. She actually follows through and ends up marrying an unshaven, scary-looking man named Jack. Jack's infamous in town because he's a known boss in the criminal underworld. During their wedding night, Jack's freed from his shackles and allowed some freedom to tidy himself up. He suddenly transforms into an impeccably mannered and handsome young man! Not exactly what Catherine was expecting...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
