    "sinopse": "Coni (Coniglio) is a shy and introverted girl, without friends, originally from Rome. For a series of bizarre events, she is now in Venice, to take the place of the grandmother who died in an accident in a large hotel, as a cleaning woman, dragging her existence in a routine. But Coni has a secret: she is a Stand user, a presence that she has never understood.\n\nThe story takes place in Venice, after the group betray the Boss. It primarily centers on Fugo and his encounters with three new stand users. A series of mass killings have been occurring, and Fugo can be seen at each crime scene - as they are apparently a result of his stand Purple Haze going berserk.",
