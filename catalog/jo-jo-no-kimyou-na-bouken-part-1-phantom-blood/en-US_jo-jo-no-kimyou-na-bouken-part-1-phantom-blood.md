## Sinopse

While the gold rush takes Europe by storm, a young Jonathan Joestar lives a life of luxury with his father at their estate in Liverpool, England. Jonathan, known by his peers as JoJo, spends his days playing the part of a gentleman and living a carefree life. However, those peaceful days soon came to an end when Dio Brando intrudes upon him.

Dio is young boy from London who is adopted into the Joestar family due to a debt Jonathan’s father owed to Dio’s father. While Jonathan is receptive towards having a new brother, Dio schemes against the Joestars in order to inherit the fortune. As Dio’s schemes get out of hand, Jonathan is forced to confront him once and for all.

Thus begins the story of the Joestar bloodline, as Jonathan matures with and eventually combats his adoptive brother while encountering bizarre new friends and foes.
