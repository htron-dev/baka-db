## Sinopse

Coni (Coniglio) is a shy and introverted girl, without friends, originally from Rome. For a series of bizarre events, she is now in Venice, to take the place of the grandmother who died in an accident in a large hotel, as a cleaning woman, dragging her existence in a routine. But Coni has a secret: she is a Stand user, a presence that she has never understood.

The story takes place in Venice, after the group betray the Boss. It primarily centers on Fugo and his encounters with three new stand users. A series of mass killings have been occurring, and Fugo can be seen at each crime scene - as they are apparently a result of his stand Purple Haze going berserk.
