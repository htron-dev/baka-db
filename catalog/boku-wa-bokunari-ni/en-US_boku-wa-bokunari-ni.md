5. The Feeling of Love
   Seiji always though a charming smile would get him out of trouble, so he grins idiotically all time. But classmate Inoue only wants to see Seiji smile for real.

6. The Four Seasons at the Toda Flower Shop
   Florist Shougo has been alone since his wife Kana died five years ago. Well, almost alone, her annoying and cheerful nephew Takao is determined to stay close to Shougo, no matter what! Takao's love is definitely more than uncle/nephew, but what about Shougo's feelings?

7. Mint Candy
   Miyahara's wedding is a reunion for former college classmates stoic Kuze and light-hearted Takeda. Even knowing how cool Kuze is, Takeda is still surprised at his nonchalance, since Takeda always thought that Kuze had a crush on Miyahara.
