    "sinopse": "Meet Suzuki Mika, teacher at Okitsu High School. Mika is a good teacher, but she has a small problem... literally. Although she's 27, she is only 148 cm tall, and has the face of a child. As a result, it is often difficult for Mika to get anyone to take her seriously.\n\n(Source: MU)",
