## Sinopse

Yuusuke & Akira used to be childhood friends, but haven't seen each other in 10 years after Akira's father was temporarily transferred for his job. Now cute Akira has come back and is living next door, and she's looking to keep Yuusuke to the promise he made to her when they were little. The problem? Akira is actually a guy!
