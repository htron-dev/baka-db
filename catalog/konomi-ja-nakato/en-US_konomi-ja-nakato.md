## Sinopse

After his father collapsed and is hospitalized, Yukinori takes over his welding factory in Kyushu as the acting president. But Yukinori, who is unfamiliar with the company and has no idea what is going on, is told by his father to rely on Maki, the factory manager. Maki is loved by everyone in the company because he's dedicated and cherishes his work, even though he's brooding, unfriendly and rough. However, one day Maki finds out that Yukinori is gay and says, "You absolutely want to get fucked while you try to run away" while pushing him down?!
