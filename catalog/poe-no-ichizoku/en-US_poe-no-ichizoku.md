The Poe family has to suffer the thirst for blood, as they live for eternity. They see loved ones die around them, and cannot be treated like normal humans, and have to live in fear as they may be killed if the humans find out about their existence. Having emotions of humans, and thirst for blood, why do such creatures live on Earth? A teenage boy from the family matures as he sees the cruel world around him.
