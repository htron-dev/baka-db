In his pleasant school life, there was only one time that had become the only stain in his life, when a student named Okachi Machi, whom Taisei had grown close to in order to get others' attention, had told him that actually he had never been his friend at all. Now Taisei wants revenge. What will happen these two?!\n\n(Source: MU)",
