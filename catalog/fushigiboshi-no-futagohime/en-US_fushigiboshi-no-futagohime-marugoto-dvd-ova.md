## Sinopse

An appendix and recap OVA bundled with the September 2005 issue of Youchien, a kindergartner magazine, that is published by the same parent company as Fushigiboshi no☆Futagohime's manga (which ran in the magazine Chao).

The OVA's intro starts with an animegao kigurumi of Rein and Fine speaking to the viewer when it then delves into the animated body recapping the series but primarily explaining the mechanics and politics of the world. The OVA ends with the animegao kigurumi again, where the actors dance the same dance as the ED of the anime.

The OVA was released in the day after the 18th episode aired.
