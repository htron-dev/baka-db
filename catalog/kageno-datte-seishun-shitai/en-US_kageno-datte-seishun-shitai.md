## Sinopse

Meet Kageno, the super dull, glasses-wearing, short first year high school girl. She has no friends and envies people who are enjoying their youth. Meet Mitsunaga Youta, the most popular, handsome guy in school. Girls constantly confesses their love to him, but he has no plans of dating anyone. After a string of events, he decides to ask Kageno to be his fake girlfriend for a month in order to stop the girls from confessing to him in exchange for his friendship. How will Kageno face all the ordeal that is about to come.

This is the beginning of a love comedy between the school idol and the negative girl.
