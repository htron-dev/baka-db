    "sinopse": "When Lauren Martin had set out to get an exclusive interview with Cole Adams, millionaire owner of a recording company, she hadn't anticipated them making headlines—as a couple. But their relationship had ended bitterly six months later, when Lauren realized their lives were taking very different paths.\n\nSince then, she'd resumed her career and reshaped her life. Until her editor assigned her to get the inside scoop on Cole's impending marriage—an assignment that Cole had specifically asked that Lauren cover!\n\nLauren knew she didn't have a choice about doing the article, but she sure had a choice about the way she'd conduct herself with Cole—she'd be cool and professional. After all, those heady days—and nights—they'd shared were definitely yesterday's news...\n\n(Source: MU)",
