## Sinopse

The courtyard is awash with cherry blossom petals, appearing especially beautiful in the moonlight. Kagura, waking up, sits in the hallway facing the courtyard, "The courtyard at night, seems like something can happen anytime......"
Suddenly a butterfly glides past, its scales glittering.
Kochou no Sei: That's right. Nighttime is indeed suitable for telling stories.
Kagura grows sleepy under the influence of dust.
Kochou no Sei: After Kagura-sama falls asleep - that will be the beginning of the story in the dream!
