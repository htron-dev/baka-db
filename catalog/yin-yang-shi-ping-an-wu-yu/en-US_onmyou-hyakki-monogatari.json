    "sinopse": "In a time when demons and humans coexisted... Evil spirits from the underworld have begun a quest for power, strength, and dominance. The balance between the two worlds is now in jeopardy.\n\nFortunately, there's a group of gifted humans who can read the stars and draw amulets. They have the power to connect the two worlds, and even tame the spirits. They are willing to lay everything on the line to maintain peace and order between the two worlds. They are known as Onmyouji.\n\n(Source: NetEase, edited)",
