## Sinopse

Metropolitan Police Department, First Investigative Division, Eighth Criminal Investigation Unit—also known as "The Eighth."

In order to solve vicious and unusual crimes, an elite force serving as both a suppression and execution force was created. Among them is a man with a high arrest rate, in contradiction with his bewildered demeanor.
