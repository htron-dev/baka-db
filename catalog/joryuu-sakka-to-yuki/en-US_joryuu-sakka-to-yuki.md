Young cafe worker Yuki dreams of romance and a life far more wonderful than her own, but has no way to do anything but hope for the future. But a chance encounter with the beautiful, mysterious authoress Beniko Azuma, a woman who seems to know love like the back of her hand, might change the very way she looks at the world...
