    "sinopse": "Hannah threw her letter of resignation at her boss, who called her \"below average.\" Still full of hurt, she visits the Blue Moon Inn, where the inn owner suggests she take a walk in the garden. That night was the night of the blue moon—the second full moon of the month. Under the magical moonlight reflected on the derelict stone-walled church, a rude yet sexy man suddenly appears. To Hannah's astonishment, it is her offensive former boss, Roth Jerric! Why would fate punish her like this? (Source: Jmanga)",
