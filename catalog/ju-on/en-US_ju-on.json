    "sinopse": "Ju-On - video side - is the manga adaptation of the Japanese horror movie that spawned an enormous franchise in Japan... and inspired a blockbuster Hollywood remake! This chilling tale of murder, secrets and revenge centers on a home and the ugly events that transpired there. The place now has new owners, but there is a vile presence that permeates the building and pollutes every surface. What wickedness set off this unstoppable angry spirit? Why has its bloody grudge infected the home and its inhabitants? In the spirit of The Ring, Ju-On delivers a dark warning of a cursed spirit and the corrupting influence it has on the living.
