    "sinopse": "Sweet but troubled Takagi escapes the ups and downs of his life by hiding his true feelings. But what will he do when shy, awkward Kumoi suddenly appears and seems to read his every thought? When a mysterious drawing surfaces and raises even more questions about the past, the two boys are faced with a crucial decision: do they stick together, or retreat to the safety of their secret fantasies?\n\nWhen the Heavens Smile serves up seven stories full of sweet, fumbling romance and the day-to-day surprises of true friendship! Whether it's in a noisy, nerve-wracking classroom or the book-lined rows of the library, each of these boys must come to terms with budding feelings and brand-new crushes. Which of these pairs destined to put aside their fears and stay together after the final school bell rings?\n\n(Source: Juné)",
