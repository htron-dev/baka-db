    "sinopse": "Andrea may be not as well-endowed as many supermodels, but she rose to the upper echelons thanks to her husband, Enrico. After they divorce, Andy finds herself lost at sea—at least, comfortably at sea with a mysterious man. While he harbors a secret of his own, the two may find some common ground with the power of a paintbrush and the skill of a model.\n\n(Source: Harlequin)",
