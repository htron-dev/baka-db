Happy to have greater freedom, he is ready to get a girlfriend and has practiced various pick-up techniques for his crucial first day.\n\nWhen he arrives on campus, he spots a beautiful dark-haired woman and approaches her holding a pack of cigarettes, ready to ask for a lighter and consequently strike up a conversation.
