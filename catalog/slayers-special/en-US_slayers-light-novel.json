    "sinopse": "Lina Inverse doesn't like to brag but she's a genius sorceress, invincible warrior and a legend in her own lunchtime. She's a strikingly gorgeous woman who would give most supermodels a run for their money. Don't hate her because she's beautiful—Lina's also in need of cold hard cash. When she stumbles upon some loot stashed away by a group of bandits, she figures they won't mind sharing. But when the booty's owners go ballistic (it seems she took a bit more than her share of the spoils), a secret hidden in the treasure holds the key to the ensuing hilarity in this fantasy novel that is sure to cast its spell on everyone!\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
