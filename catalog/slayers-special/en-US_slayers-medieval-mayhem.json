    "sinopse": "Young sorceress Lina Inverse and her dim-witted sidekick Gourry Gabriev travel through a somewhat medieval setting, doing good and fighting evil. Well, by \"doing good and fighting evil\" I mean \"stealing from corrupt rich people and blowing things up\".\n\nThe stories in this volume are occasional tie-ins to the novels and short stories.\n\n(Source: MU)",
