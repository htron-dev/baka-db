## Sinopse

Young sorceress Lina Inverse and her dim-witted sidekick Gourry Gabriev travel through a somewhat medieval setting, doing good and fighting evil. Well, by "doing good and fighting evil" I mean "stealing from corrupt rich people and blowing things up".

The stories in this volume are occasional tie-ins to the novels and short stories.
