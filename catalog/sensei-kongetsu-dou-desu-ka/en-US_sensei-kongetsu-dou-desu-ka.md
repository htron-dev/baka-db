## Sinopse

Murasaki has the power to see the future of the person she touches. As the landlord's daughter, she has to chase after Shijima Banri for rent every month. Every time, the poor author Shijima promises her that he'll pay rent as soon as he gets published and gets paid. Murasaki quietly supports his work, because she can see that Shijima is the person she is fated to marry.
