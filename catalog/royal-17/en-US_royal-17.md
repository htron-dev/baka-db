## Sinopse

Since the day she was born, Rumina has had her life planned out for her. Since she's from a high-class family, she's expected to do everything perfectly and she gets no choice in anything; not her friend, make-up or even boyfriend! Fed up, Rumina runs away and goes to a fastfood joint. After she's ordered, she realizes that she hadn't brought her wallet. A handsome teen pays for her meal, but in exchange she has to go on a date with him. Insulted after he steals her first kiss, she returns home. There, she finds out that he's her new bodyguard!
