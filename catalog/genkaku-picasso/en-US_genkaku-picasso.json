    "sinopse": "Hikari \"Picasso\" Hamura is a talented yet awkward 17-year-old high school artist. Chiaki Yamamoto, Picasso's only friend, gave him his nickname, and the two often spend time after school by the riverside sketching the scenery and reading books. However, misery comes to Picasso's life after the sudden death of Chiaki in a tragic helicopter accident they shared.\n\nPicasso questions why he survived the fatal crash, barely scathed, while Chiaki suffered the worst possible fate. But as all hope seems lost, Picasso—remembering that Chiaki left him something right before her death—reaches into his pocket and pulls out a miniature Chiaki! The tiny version of his deceased friend explains to him that he should have also died in the accident, but due to her prayers, God allowed Picasso to live on the condition that he uses his artistic talents and newfound powers of seeing deeper into people's problems to help others in need.\n\nFaced with death unless he complies, Picasso soon agrees to the terms. Armed with his trusted pencil and sketchbook, Picasso draws out his classmates' troubles and leaps into his creations in order to save them.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
