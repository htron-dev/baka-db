## Sinopse

A disturbed newborn finds himself tasked with carrying out his mother's will—to exact her revenge upon the world. Growing up with sociopathic tendencies facilitates his twisted behaviors as he methodically schemes gruesome acts throughout his childhood. This leads him down a spiral of murder and immoral acts in this dark tale of a misunderstood child going from nothing to reaching a god-like state.
