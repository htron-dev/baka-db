## Sinopse

Sixteen-year-old Yanagisawa Yae is our very optimistic heroine. Even when she was given only two options to pick from—either to move overseas with her parents due to their jobs or to move to the countryside to stay closer to her grandparents, she chose the latter.

As she looked up the apartment she would be moving into, she ended up in a shrine. Since she is in the shrine anyways, she offers her prayer and tries out the fortune-notes. Incredibly, she picks up a "very good-luck" fortune-note yet it has only bad lucks written on it.

The next day, despite of all her optimism, Yae finds herself struggling as misfortunes befall her one after the other...
