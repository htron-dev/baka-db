He has already been engaged to Layla's sister Rose, and she is said to have a child. What happened to the days of sacrificing everything and enduring rigorous daughter education... Waiting for Layla, who escaped from the prince's family, was a marriage proposal from a legendary magician. But the prince, who should have fallen out of love with her, is still holding on to her!\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
