## Sinopse

I will never let you escape.

On the day she woke up from a two-year coma caused by an accident, Layla learned that her engagement with the crown prince had been abandoned. He has already been engaged to Layla's sister Rose, and she is said to have a child. What happened to the days of sacrificing everything and enduring rigorous daughter education... Waiting for Layla, who escaped from the prince's family, was a marriage proposal from a legendary magician. But the prince, who should have fallen out of love with her, is still holding on to her!
