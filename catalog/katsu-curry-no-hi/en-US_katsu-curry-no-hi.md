## Sinopse

The manga centers around Miyuki, a 28-year-old office worker who has just broken up with the boyfriend she was living with, and begins trying arranged dates. She finds no one she's interested in, and randomly writes her scattered thoughts inside a notebook at a reading cafe. Later, she finds that a man she doesn't know has made a sharply-written reply in the same notebook, and they begin to converse in this way.
