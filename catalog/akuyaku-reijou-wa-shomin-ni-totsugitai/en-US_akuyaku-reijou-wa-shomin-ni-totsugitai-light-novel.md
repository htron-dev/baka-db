## Sinopse

Love interests? More like NOT interested! Gimme that cute commoner NPC!

After reincarnating, I found myself as the Vvillainess in an otome game I often played. A prince, a knight, a magician... to these high-spec love interests I say "No thank you!" I'll beat down all the destruction flags in my way with all my might to get happily married with my beloved "commoner" character!
