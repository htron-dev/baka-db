    "sinopse": "Before reincarnating as the villainess Isabella Ali Rottenstein, she was just one of the many fans of the game Love☆Magical. While most fawned over the handsome and charming love interests, in her eyes, none could hold a candle to her most beloved Ursch Schneiver. Sure, he was somewhat plain and a mere supporting character running the gacha store, but even so, she invested all her money just to see his bright expressions.\n\nNow, they are no longer separated by a screen. While Isabella's role in the story would normally be to commit evil deeds and obstruct the heroine, she wants nothing to do with it! Ursch is just too cute... well, she might as well marry him!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
