## Sinopse

Nakaaki Keiko and Mimasaka Kousuke met when they were only 16 years old in high school. Keiko was the student council vice president and top of her class. Kousuke had been expelled from his previous school and spent most of his time making films. This story chronicles the lives of these two seemingly dissimilar friends over a span of 10 years, weaving a poignant tale of misconnections and missed opportunities in a pursuit to find their true selves.
