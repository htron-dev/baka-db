## Sinopse

Sweet and innocent orphan Man Tou, while optimistic and tough in his own way, often feels lonely deep inside. Without the care of parents, he longs for love more than anyone else. Being ridiculed and bullied by others as the parentless child, he longs for a genuine friendship that is yet to come. Though uncertain where his future lies, Man Tou has faith that keeps on working hard and never stops giving love will find him that place he can call home.
