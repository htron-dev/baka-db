A young girl plays a flute, summons a dragon, and flies to the castle of Maou Mudo. The three enter and do not encounter any trouble until they reach the throne room. Mudo surprises them and seemingly kills the girl and the martial artist. After Mudo defeats the leader, Botsu, he wakes up at home in the village of Lifecod.",
