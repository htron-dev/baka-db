## Sinopse

Chronicles the story of Dragon Quest VI

The story begins with three travelers sitting around a fire. The leader says the time is right and the trio walks out to a nearby cliff. A young girl plays a flute, summons a dragon, and flies to the castle of Maou Mudo. The three enter and do not encounter any trouble until they reach the throne room. Mudo surprises them and seemingly kills the girl and the martial artist. After Mudo defeats the leader, Botsu, he wakes up at home in the village of Lifecod.
