    "sinopse": "It would be hard for anyone to imagine the combination of a mother and a telegraph pole. How could such a thing be possible? The image of the telegraph pole raising her child using cables in place of arms and legs is quite charming. The spirit of the producer who made such a wild idea into a film is also quite charming.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
