## Sinopse

After losing a game, Sora Andou finally felt the limit to his talent and decided to quit soccer before middle school graduation; however, a surprise meeting with Shiki Wakamiya, the representative of Japan's national women's soccer team, enabled him to see again what he used to see―the pure joy of the sport that shaped him into who he is.

This is the story of a boy who inherited the will of a girl, and a series of warm encounters―from friends to strangers―during the journey to his ultimate goal: to become "1/11" of the world's best soccer team.
