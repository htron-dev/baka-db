## Sinopse

Sulley and Mike work at Monsters, Inc., the biggest scream processing plant in Monstropolis. When one little child named Boo wanders into their world, it's the monsters who are scared silly. Thinking she is dangerous and toxic, Sulley and Mike do their best to return Boo to her bedroom, but there are some monstrous hurdles in their way.
