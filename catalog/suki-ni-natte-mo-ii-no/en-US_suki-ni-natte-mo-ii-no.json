Not only is he stalking her, but he also tries to seduce her knowing full well she's a high school student who already has a boyfriend. She can't stand him at all so why is she so drawn to him? On the surface Akihisa seems like the worst kind of man... Is he just toying with Yuuki or does he really care about her?\n\n(Source: Mangaupdates)\n\nContains 2 extra chapters in volume 4.",
