## Sinopse

Sakiko Kinoshita is in love. Unfortunately it's with her college professor Takashou Chifuyu, who's already married and has turned down all the advances she's made on him. When her mother decides to leave, Sakiko is unwilling to leave and decides to take care of her tuition and expenses herself. However she doesn't have a job or a way to pay for them. When she's about to sell herself to get the money she runs into Natsuo, who not only saves her from making that mistake but helps her get one step closer to the thing she desires most.
