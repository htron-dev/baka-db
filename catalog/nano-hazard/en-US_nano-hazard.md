## Sinopse

Enjou Shuuto's dream was always to become a detective and take down the scumbag who killed his father. As practice, he takes on the local bullies at every opportunity... only to get his butt handed to him. But what happens when rogue nanobots descend on his neighborhood, "enhancing" their hosts with deadly results?
