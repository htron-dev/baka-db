## Sinopse

Dah-In Hyun, a normal everyday schoolgirl, discovers that she and the other students at Saint Marie have become pawns in a proverbial chess game. When her best friend dies trying to defend herself, Dah-In finds herself trapped in a battle where no one is who they seem, and the line between black and white is blurred.
