    "sinopse": "\"I want to do more dirty things with you.\"\n\nKinoshita is a handsome high school student who is slightly thick in the head, and has fallen in love with his cool classmate, Yano. Kino believed that he would be satisfied with just being friends, while he'd have sexual fantasies of Yano, but a seat rearrangement misunderstanding pushes him to confess to him...\n\n(Source: Julian Publishing, translated)",
