    "sinopse": "As the only member of the pop music club not to graduate, the responsibility of recruiting new members has fallen to Azusa. Ui and Jun have agreed to help out their friend, but they might be more interested in having actual afterschool teatime than making music. Even when Azusa secures the necessary four members to keep the club alive, the lack of musical experience (and musical instruments) is going to be a challenge! Will the high school pop music club survive to take the stage once more?!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
