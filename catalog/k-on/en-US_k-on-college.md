## Sinopse

Following their memorable graduation, the original members of the Light Music Club now begin their lives as college students. As grown-ups, Yui Hirasawa and the others must learn how to be more responsible—from not oversleeping to personal grooming. College may be tough, but with the presence of a light music club and a group of new faces, the girls can handle anything in their way.

As the sounds of joyful music play in the fleeting story of K-On! College, the quartet faces their next stage in life head on while retaining their usual goofy personalities.
