## Sinopse

Plain, ordinary salaryman Kei has thrown everything away for a sex worker he's fallen in love with. Trying to help her get out of debt, he's made some bad investments. In despair over his own failings, he attempts suicide and nearly dies. When he next opens his eyes, he finds himself inside a sex establishment catering to gaysâ€”Circus. At Circus, four men live and work together while each of them searches for love and a way to live... "My heart depends on goodness, wherever it may come from."
