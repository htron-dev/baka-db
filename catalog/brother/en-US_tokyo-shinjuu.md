## Sinopse

Beautiful, naive Minato Akina has come to Tokyo to seek his fortune. However, he ends up losing all of his money on the first day, an event that does not bode well for our young hero. A chance meeting with "down-on-his-luck" Chiba Rintarou gives Akina a shot at becoming a young idol. But Akina and Chiba are both carrying scars from the past.
