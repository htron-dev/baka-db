When Liz, the CEO of a housekeeping company, visits her client, also a CEO, she finds out that he is none other than Cain, her ex-husband. After the divorce three years ago, Cain established himself as a successful businessman. With his black eyes and sexy body, it isn't long before Liz feels his magnetic pull. On the other hand, Cain, wanting to allay his guilt over their past, offers to support Liz's company financially.
