## Sinopse

Second-year high school student Seiji Utsumi is hopelessly in love with Shou Iketani, the energetic and scatter-brained tennis club captain in the year above him, but he cannot bring himself to even talk with her. Unable to make any progress, he is perfectly content with just watching from afar—perhaps a bit too literally.

While spying on the tennis club's morning practice on the first day of a new semester, Seiji is spotted and accused of peeping by Yuki Kurokawa, a club member who ends up in his class. However, when she sees that Seiji has no bad intentions and is serious about Shou, Yuki decides to help him confess his feelings.

As Seiji gets closer to Shou with Yuki's guidance, he realizes that his simplistic view of love and relationships prevents him from seeing the complexity and darkness under the surface—for both Shou and Yuki. Can he navigate through all the heartbreak and misunderstandings to reach his good ending?
