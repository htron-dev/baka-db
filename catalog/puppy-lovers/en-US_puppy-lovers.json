But she still hasn't found a publisher willing to take her under her wing.\n\nOne day, however, Souta Inusaki, the son of a distant relative, comes to live with Eri and her mother. Souta is an aspiring violinist and has come to Tokyo to practice. Eri sees a lot of herself in the young Souta. But how will she deal with a 13-year-old boy following his dreams and going through puberty?\n\n(Source: MU)",
