## Sinopse

Eri Inui is a 20-year-old college student aspiring to become a mangaka. She has been following this dream ever since she was little and has been the best artist among all her friends. But she still hasn't found a publisher willing to take her under her wing.

One day, however, Souta Inusaki, the son of a distant relative, comes to live with Eri and her mother. Souta is an aspiring violinist and has come to Tokyo to practice. Eri sees a lot of herself in the young Souta. But how will she deal with a 13-year-old boy following his dreams and going through puberty?
