## Sinopse

The story takes place in 1963 Los Angeles. A pair known as "Lady and Oldman" wander from street to street for delivery missions on their motorcycle and sidecar, sometimes getting caught in cases and sometimes finding solutions. Lady (Shelly) was a 19-year-old waitress at her father's diner and Oldman (Rob) is a fellow who served 100 years in prison yet mysteriously looks young and can heal quickly.

Bit by bit Shelly unravels Rob's past.
