"You have a nasty look in your eyes!" "You’re freaking tall!" 172 cm tall and has eyes that slant real bad. Yuuri had a complex about how she looks. My best childhood friend, Itsuki, dated the little and cute Moeka and broke Yuuri’s heart... The one who help Yuuri change her appearance so much was a high school cameraman named Jun. Yuuri noticed Jun likes her and begins to think she wants to get cuter for Jun...?!
