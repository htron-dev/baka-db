## Sinopse

Sakon is a traveling Bunraku puppeteer who goes from place to place with his puppet companion, Ukon, a puppet made in the Meiji era. Ukon and Sakon's personalities are as different as night and day. While Sakon is shy and mysterious, Ukon is loud and wise-cracking. Together they solve the mysteries they come across in their travels.
