## Sinopse

Why do you bear no grudge towards me? Why do you like me? I know how you feel about me, yet I pretend not to notice...

Kyosumi, an up-and-coming photographer lives with his late best friend's younger brother, Hibari. He looks after Hibari as he feels responsible for the death of his best friend as well as colleague. Kyosumi has sworn an oath to be Hibari's family, after he had lost his only blood relative.

I took your loved one away from you.
