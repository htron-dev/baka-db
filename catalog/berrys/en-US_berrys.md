## Sinopse

The protagonist, Houkou Hayao decides to take a job interview at a family restaurant, "Berry's," in order to find out what to do when he graduates.

On the same day as the interview, he bumps into a certain girl who just got out from the interview room in a bad mood, and binge eats at Berry's. He later ended up hanging around with her. When he gets home, he finds out that Yuuka, his sister, has found out that he got a job without her permission.

Later, he learns that the binge-eating girl which introduces herself as Morikubo Yuna he met is actually a new employee like him.
