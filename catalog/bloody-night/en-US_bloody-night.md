## Sinopse

A little girl is wandering the streets late at night, but something is eerily amiss. Suddenly, a vicious red monster appears and begins chasing her. As she desperately tries to get away, she encounters a homeless old man in an alleyway and later an armed policeman who both try to save her. Can either of these brave men save the girl from the monster that pursues her so relentlessly?
