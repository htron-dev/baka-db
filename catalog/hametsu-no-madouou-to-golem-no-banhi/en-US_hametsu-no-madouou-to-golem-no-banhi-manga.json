    "sinopse": "A young man suddenly awakens in the middle of an open field, with only his lame pajamas as company. Apparently he was summoned as a \"Sorcerer King of Destruction\" to destroy the world. What the hell?! But nothing's going to happen by staying depressed, so why not make a golem with earth magic! And then...?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
