## Sinopse

A young man suddenly awakens in the middle of an open field, with only his lame pajamas as company. Apparently he was summoned as a "Sorcerer King of Destruction" to destroy the world. What the hell?! But nothing's going to happen by staying depressed, so why not make a golem with earth magic! And then...?
