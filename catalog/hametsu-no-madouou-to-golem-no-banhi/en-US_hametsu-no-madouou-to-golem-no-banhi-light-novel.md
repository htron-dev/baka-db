## Sinopse

He has no name, and he has no memory. All he knows is that he was summoned by a dark spell with a gruesome sacrifice. Now, he’s the Sorcerer King of Destruction, fated to bring about the end of the world. His only hope to defy that fate lies in his partner, a beautiful elven golem with a terrifying taste for violence. She will be his greatest protector—just as he must become hers!
