    "sinopse": "Rinne, a huge fan of Buddhism, was searching for a \"monk-type,\" a boy as calm, intelligent and diligent as Lord Buddha himself, when she set her sights on a young, handsome monk-in-training, Yuuryou. She soon learns that this kid, out of his robes, is not her dream boy, but a shallow, irresponsible lady killer who goes by Yura. Is Rinne going to give up on her fantasy, or is there more to Yura than meets the eye?\n\n(Source: MU)",
