    "sinopse": "Ryou Saitou is a rowdy delinquent obsessed with getting into fights. One day he meets Asuka Fujisaki, an innocent underclassman who wishes to become his pupil. Asuka looks at the fearless, belligerent Ryou with stars in his eyes, but lurking behind that facade is a desire to take revenge on him! \"Now it's my turn to turn you into a girl.\" A scheming, deceiving underclassman versus an unyielding delinquent! The pupil becomes the master on Mount Love!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
