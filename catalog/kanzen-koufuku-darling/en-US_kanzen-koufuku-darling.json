Asuka looks at the fearless, belligerent Ryou with stars in his eyes, but lurking behind that facade is a desire to take revenge on him! \"Now it's my turn to turn you into a girl.\" A scheming, deceiving underclassman versus an unyielding delinquent! The pupil becomes the master on Mount Love!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
