## Sinopse

Don't let go of your lamp or get close to the darkness.

Since ancient times, there have been spirits of darkness in this town. They dwell in the darkness. The "lamps of darkness," whose flames are made of human souls, live in their hand.

We are afraid of the darkness because the sprints of darkness quietly rob humans of their souls from the shadows. Countless human souls have been made into their flames.

You too, be careful so that you won't have your soul robbed.
