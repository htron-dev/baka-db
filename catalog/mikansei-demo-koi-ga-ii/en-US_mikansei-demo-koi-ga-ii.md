## Sinopse

Oustandly shy beauty Ichika just entered high school, but nobody talks to her, and she has trouble making friends. One day, the rumored "most evil" former delinquent Yuuya Yotsukado talks to her behind the school, and for some reason ended up going to karaoke together...

There, he said "I wanted to return something that you dropped," and makes a suggestion that's extremely different from what the rumors say? The after school strategy meetings(?!) in order to fulfill their dreams start now!
