## Sinopse

After dying in a mountain climbing accident, a 28-year-old man finds himself reincarnated in an alternate world...but as a polar bear!

After taking a time to get acquainted with his new body, the main character soon learns that he can fight better than 'Akuma' from Street Fighter after he witnesses a beast girl being hunted by the army and gets ticked off. The question is: is this new life a blessing, or a curse?
