While he was running away the sea surface suddenly rose, and when a brilliant light appeared he saw a strange looking battleship flying in the air. He was dumped into the sea and when he crawled onto the battleship there was a beautiful girl standing there. She said her name was Lyx, the princess of another world, and added, \"My Father is Japanese, Shinjiro Sakomizu. Please help me, Suzuki.\"\n\nBased on the novel series by the Gundam creator Yoshiyuki Tomino.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",
