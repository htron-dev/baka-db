## Sinopse

Sleep, wake, and work—sums up the day-to-day life of 39-year old, Nozue. A routine that eases him, and conversely weighs heavily on him—which worries the hard-eyed but reliable Togawa, a 29-year old subordinate of his. In an unexpected turn of events, the two of them end up visiting a pancake shop bustling with girls.
