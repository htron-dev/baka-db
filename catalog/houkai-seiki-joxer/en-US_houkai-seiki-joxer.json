    "sinopse": "The \"Great Destruction\" was a tumultuous event which tore the world asunder and reduced it to a vast desert known as the \"Dry Aqua.\" With this event creating rifts in time and space, powerful creatures have emerged into the world. Luckily, civilization has been able to hold against them through the use of \"Maki,\" magical vessels that can contain and restrain the beasts. However, depending on the user, Maki can be just as harmful as they are helpful.\n\nTravelling through the Dry Aqua is aged veteran Len and his young companion Jou, hunters who use Maki to capture their marks. However, they also have special targets: \"Shadow Eaters,\" soldiers who once merged together with their Maki but are now unable to control themselves. To keep society safe, the pair task themselves with cleansing the Dry Aqua of this threat. However, once a soldier himself, Len will not be able to escape his sins from the past for much longer.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
