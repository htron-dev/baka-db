    "sinopse": "This is the sexually comedic story of a student council. The president, Kasukabe Sumire, often unintentionally puts herself in sexual situations. She's accompanied by the vice president, Toda Yui, who tries to keep things serious and on track. Yui isn't helped by the secretary, foreign exchange student Cindy, whose clumsiness with Japanese often leads her to make surprisingly raunchy statements. They also have a rather perverted robot, who makes a questionable contribution to the group.\n\nAs the story opens, Kasukabe has fallen for a male student, Asaka Tooru, based on his actions towards her on a day when she forgot to wear her skirt. Kasukabe is determined that he should be the last member of their student council. However, not only does he have no interest in the student council, he's planning on transferring to another school! Will the student council be able to reel Asaka in? What other ridiculous situations will this dysfunctional council encounter throughout their school career?\n\n(Source: MU)",
