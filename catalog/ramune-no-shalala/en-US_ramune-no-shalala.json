    "sinopse": "Summer has always been difficult for Kamachi, but a chance encounter on his way to the neighboring school's swimming pool may offer a different experience. Suzuya, the assistant swim class coach of Kamachi's younger brother, provides Kamachi a break from the heat with a refreshing bottle of ramune. At first, Kamachi only visits the pool to express his thanks but ends up coming by so often that he practically becomes a student.\n\nSoon, the end of swim class draws near, and Kamachi can no longer use his summer fever as an excuse for his constant blushing around Suzuya. Kamachi struggles to control his bubbling feelings, yet it is merely a matter of time before everything overflows in an effervescent splendor.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
