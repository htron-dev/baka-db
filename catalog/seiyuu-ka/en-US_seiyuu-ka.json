    "sinopse": "As a child, Hime Kino was starstruck by \"Lovely Blazers\" voice actress Sakura Aoyama. From that day on, Hime has dreamed of following in Sakura's footsteps.\n\nWith this in mind, Hime enrolls in Hiiragi Academy, a voice acting school famous for producing the best of the best. In fact, Hime sits right next to the already successful son of Sakura, Senri Kudou. Aiming to match her peers' level of skill, Hime attempts to put her best foot forward. She introduces herself with her cutest voice, but what comes out is anything but—she sounds like an old man, earning her the nickname \"Gorilla Princess.\" Suddenly, she finds herself grouped with other potential dropouts.\n\nBut Hime is not deterred by such a setback, and she quickly becomes friends with the others at the bottom of the class. With their help and her own unrivaled optimism, Hime will do whatever it takes to achieve her dream!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
