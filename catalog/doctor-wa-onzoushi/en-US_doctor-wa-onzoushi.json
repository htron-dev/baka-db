    "sinopse": "She's about to fall in love with him...but she knows it will only bring her pain...\n\nPhilomena is a nurse working at a hospital in London. She's great with patients and has passed the RN exam with the highest honors but has no one to celebrate with. Her father and cheering section has passed away, and her stepmother and stepsisters despise her occupation and are too busy enjoying their lives of indulgence to pay much attention to Philly. As she prepares to leave work, the deep voice of a man stops her in her tracks. It's handsome Dr. Walle van der Tack from the Netherlands. He flashes her a brilliant smile and asks Philly out to dinner to celebrate her accomplishment...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
