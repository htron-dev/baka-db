## Sinopse

The series follows Meisuke Nueno, better known as Nube, an exorcist who also happens to be the teacher for a 5th grade class at Doumori Elementary. While he uses many various exorcism techniques, his main weapon is the Demon Hand which is the power of a chaotic oni sealed right where his left hand should be. The series follows Nube and Doumori class 5-3 though the many weird, chaotic, and downright silly and insane encounters they face with the many forms and elements of the supernatural.
