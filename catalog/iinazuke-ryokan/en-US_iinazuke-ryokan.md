## Sinopse

Collection of three short stories.

1. Fiancé Inn
   "Sanae has a fiance? Moreover, he is the young owner of a big Japanese Inn. Is she marrying into money?" Sanae quickly begins her training to become a proprietress, but will she become more interested in the manager than the owner...?!

2. Secret Housemate
   This story was the first one in the anthology Chokotto H na Koi Monogatari. Sweet short story of a middle school boy in love with a high school girl. She is meticulous about wanting to know everything about the person she is dating. Her emotion conflict when she meets this middle school boy, who challenges her way of thinking about relationship. The author diligently places the character in a muddled, flustered, and distraught air of insecure emotions. She feels baffled because she can't comprehend why she likes him, even though she knows nothing about him.

3. Beloved Mantleman
