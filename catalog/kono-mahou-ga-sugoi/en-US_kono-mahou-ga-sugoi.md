## Sinopse

Boys... and magic...what else do you need to know?

Kureha is a first-year in a magic school. Though determined Kureha is terrible with magic. Somehow he befriends the two greatest students in the school, Toudou-san with an incredible volume of magic (and loves teasing him), and Ren-senpai who made 'mage master' in his first-year (who always help guide him).

As time goes a new transfer student names Kagami befriends the three friends, but Kureha must face Kagami now because he's taken away Toudou whose always there for him. So, will he realize his feelings?
