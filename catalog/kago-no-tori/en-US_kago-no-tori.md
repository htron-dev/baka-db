## Sinopse

A young Chinese boy, Lee-Ren is purchased from his poverty stricken mother by a Japanese official for sexual purposes in 1910. Thus begins the 'owned' life of Lee-Ren in his master's household, where he is alternately sold out and used within. Jin, the naive young son of the master, grows up with Lee-Ren. This is the story of their tumultuous relationship.
