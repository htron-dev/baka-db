## Sinopse

"Thank you. It was the memory of a lifetime." That's what Emily told Luca, the man she met while on vacation in Verona. She leaves for London tomorrow and she'll never see him again. The time she spent with Luca was a luxurious dream that she must wake up from. No promises were made, and so she left him with a goodbye. She couldn't hope for more, no matter how strong her feelings for him. But leaving Luca behind will prove difficult—he's carved his passion into Emily's body and she can't get him out of her mind...
