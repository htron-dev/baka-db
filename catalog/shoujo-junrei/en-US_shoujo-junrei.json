    "sinopse": "Tokyo is the last place that anyone would want to be as the city is rocked by constant earthquakes and abnormally severe weather, but Aiko still wants to be there. She moved to Tokyo out of an adoration for Shion Shinonome, a mangaka whose work touched her so greatly that she reveres them like a god. What she doesn't know is that Mao, her lonely, gloomy next-door neighbor, is actually Shinonome-sensei herself. Their complicated relationship grows deeper as Mao tries to keep her identity a secret while struggling with the pedestal that Aiko has unknowingly put her on.\n\n[Written by Denji]",
