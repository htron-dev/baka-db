    "sinopse": "High school girl Hana Hanasaki hits whoever is near her once she hears something sexual (she's only successful one-third of the time)! Then there's an extremely stingy, money-loving high school boy, Ikki Rokkaku! Their story begins in a residential area where Hanasaki is wedged inbetween two (moveable) walls of a narrow path. Rokkaku finds her and helps her get free! The story develops at the DVD shop, \"LATNER,\" where the two work. Lots of gags abound at the part-time job that's a wee perverted and super silly! It's okay to jump in at any point in the series! Oh, and there's love!\n\n(Source: Manga Box)",
