    "sinopse": "\"What's the greatest happiness one can know in love?\" For Yutaka, there is only one answer: sex. To him, happiness and lust are the same thing. The likeable and respectable heir to the wealthy Fujiwara family is being torn inside-out by repressed physical desires. Then one day, Tohno, a transfer student, shows up at school. Yutaka sees Tohno as the \"toy\" that will make real all his desires and debauched fantasies. A life-long friendship based on trust and gratitude...will it all be shattered when Tohno learns the truth about Yutaka's obsession?\n\n(Source: Juné Manga)",
