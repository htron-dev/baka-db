## Sinopse

Ranga was an ogre. However, he was also a strong ogre. Strong enough that he became one of the four most elite demons in the whole land. And, as with many other stories, his comrades betray him. Upon his death, he reincarnates as a normal human. Now, with all of the knowledge and strength of his former life, what do you think he’ll do with this new opportunity?
