## Sinopse

16th century Japan—the Sengoku Period. A time when rival warlords vied for control of Japan. The Uesugi Clan were the protectors of Province of Echigo. Naoe Kanetsugu is the illegitimate child of his liege lord Uesugi Kenshin, a man who pledged lifelong celibacy. In this dark period of conspiracy and intrigue, Kanetsugu is one of the few men who strive to stand in the light.

In 1598, the regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi passed away, and the country was thrown into a war of succession, between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Ishida Mitsunari. This is the chain of events that lead up to the bloodest battle in the history of Japan: The Battle of Sekigahara!! This is a tale of hot-blooded men, who lived and died by their honour!
