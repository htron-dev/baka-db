    "sinopse": "This is a story about self-proclaimed masked pro-wrestler Hyuuga and his roommate Akaru. Hyuuga doesn't remove his mask even at home—could it be that it's his actual face?! Koketsu Dining, a story of a tiger (who even has a tail!) and the air-headed Akaru, who has unknowingly started to admire the gentle Hyuuga.\n\nIt was like this that they started living together. But happy and heart-throbbing situations just keep happening…!?\n\n(Source: MU)",
