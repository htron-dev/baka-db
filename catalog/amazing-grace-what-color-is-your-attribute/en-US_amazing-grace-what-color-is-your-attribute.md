## Sinopse

Shuu woke up in a snowy town with no recollection of his past. He thought it was a strange place with an antique feel of Europe in the Middle Ages and a deep appreciation of the arts. There was also a towering wall known as "Aurora" which surrounded by the town and sealed it off from the outside. However, he was taken in by the townspeople and eventually attended Saint Aleia Academy and enjoyed his time with the other students there.

However, this newfound happiness was snatched in an instant when a mysterious fire destroyed the town on Christmas Day. Yune loved the town more than anyone and vowed from the bottom of her heart to change the town’s fate, turning back time to the December 2nd, the first day of Advent.

Why did the disaster occur? Why did the town’s fate remain unchanged no matter how many times they turned back time? Why were they able to turn back time in the first place?
