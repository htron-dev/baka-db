    "sinopse": "The story follows the lives of a colony of children marooned on a space ship adrift between Earth and Mars. It was during a routine dive procedure when their space station plummeted into a \"plasma field\" called the Geduld, killing all the adult instructors and leaving the trainees to survive on their own via a ship called Ryvius. All seems to be going well until the thirst for power corrupts one of the crew, and a grab for ultimate control is made. Based on the intense Bandai anime, Infinite Ryvius promises to delve further into the story than previously imagined.\n\n(Source: MU)",
