## Sinopse

Miki and her older sister Sakana are the owners of the Japanese pub "Poan," where the cooking is delicious and so is the alcohol. They meet many different types of people coming into their pub, all with different kinds of troubles. The sisters do their best to make Poan a place where people can find good food, drink, and peace, and where they may be able to resolve some of the things that are troubling them.
