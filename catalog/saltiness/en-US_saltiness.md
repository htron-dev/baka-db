## Sinopse

31 year old Nakamaru Takehiko has trained all his life to never be disturbed by anything that the world throws at him. Whether dog poop begins to rain down from the heavens, or a human shaped strawberry monster shows up in front of him, his will never faltered. But when he realized that his existence in the house inhibits his sister from getting married, he panicked. In his panicked state, he left the house for Tokyo. Now homeless, he must find ways to survive in this world with only his iron will and the companions he finds along the way.
