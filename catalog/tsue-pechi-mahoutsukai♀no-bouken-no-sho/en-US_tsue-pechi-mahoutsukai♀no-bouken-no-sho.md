## Sinopse

Mao is 14 years old and the daughter of a legendary warrior and top martial artist. A child of the elite, she longs to be the cutest of witches, but Mao is a little on the impulsive side and not actually that smart. Although she is quite strong, her magic power is zero and her life is a series of destruction... followed by regret...
