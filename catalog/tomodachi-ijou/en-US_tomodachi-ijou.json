    "sinopse": "Life is hard enough as it is without the complcations love interests bring. However, it becomes even more complicated when the interest in question is a friend. How does one choose between what is right and what is wrong? The male friend you've always been with or the one that's recently come back?\n\nThis is a set of five short stories about the trials and tribulations of five different women.\n\n(Source: Blue Flor)",
