## Sinopse

Tootsuki Yaya can see things nobody else can. One day, she is attacked by a monster-spider, and a puppy comes to her rescue. But when she unties the strange ribbon around its neck, it turns into the Wolf Kind of the demon world! Finally free after a thousand years, he’s out to get the holy maiden who imprisoned him in a canine body for so long. And guess who is her reincarnation..?
