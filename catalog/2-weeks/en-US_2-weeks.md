## Sinopse

Late one night in the school building, Kamishiro Yukisuke, who holds a healing power, had an encounter with Kuroto Satsuki, who was fighting a strange zebra-man. Unknown to them, the two ability holders were bound by fate.

A bad sensed murder occurring at the same time, a hamster that can speak, a half invisible younger sister and a spaceship crash. After finding out about the two power holders, a classmate Okuda Emi invited the two of them to the 'Occult Research Club' where many individuals gather.

A screwed up love story between 'the boy that won't die' and 'the girl who would unconditionally kill.'
