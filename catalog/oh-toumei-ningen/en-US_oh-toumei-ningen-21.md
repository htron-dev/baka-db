## Sinopse

We rejoin Tooru heading into the 21st century, some 10 years after he first discovered his power to become invisible. Sometime in his 2nd year of high school, his powers stopped working, and he's managed to become a productive member of society. Then, one day, his aunt asks him to clean up the freezer, and he discovers an old container of salmon roe that had frozen away in a corner. Miraculously, the roe in this container still activates his power! And of course, Tooru's still not quite restrained enough to not use this power again...
