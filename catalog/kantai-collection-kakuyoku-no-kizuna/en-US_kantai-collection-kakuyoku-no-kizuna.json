    "sinopse": "Having supposed to have sank after a desperate battle, Aircraft Carrier Zuikaku opens her eyes to discover that she has become one of the young girls known as 'Ship-girls.' Having becoming one of the 'ship-girls' possessed with the powers and memories of the War of the Past, Zuikaku and her elder sister Shoukaku reunite, and through the man known as the Admiral, she comes to terms with the existence of humanity's enemy: the Abyssal Ships. She resolves to protect this world that is so similar to that of her memories and embarks once more onto the battlefield—and must experience and confront the implications of her own cruel fate.\n\n(Source: Baka-Tsuki)",
