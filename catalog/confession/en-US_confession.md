## Sinopse

Two mountain climbing friends, Asai and Ishikura, get trapped in the middle of a storm after an accident. Ishikura, earnestly believing he is about to die, decides to relieve his heart and confesses a sin from his past. However, he survives, and both make their way to a deserted cabin while waiting for help to arrive. But the knowledge of the confession weighs heavy on the both of them, and the long wait under the pressure begins to hack away at their sanity.
