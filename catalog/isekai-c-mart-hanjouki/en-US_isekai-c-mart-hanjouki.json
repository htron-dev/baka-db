    "sinopse": "This is the story about a \"shopkeeper\" who \"quit\" that stress-filled reality and casually disappeared into another world.\n\n\"I want to repay the kindness of the people in that other world! With an elf who I found collapsed on the road to help at the register, I, the shopkeeper, opened a small shop. The goods I have lined up are from modern society! Sugar and coffee, chainsaws, and plastic bags, today we'll sell all we can!\n\nOur another-world C-mart is full of customers, ranging from our neighbour \"oba-chan\" to children to dwarf-smiths and even legendary adventurers!?\n\nIn my relaxed, slow life as shopkeeper, with a carefree attitude we're open for business today as well!\"\n\n(Source: Shueisha)",
