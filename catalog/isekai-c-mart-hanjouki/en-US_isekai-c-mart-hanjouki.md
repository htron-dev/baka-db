## Sinopse

This is the story about a "shopkeeper" who "quit" that stress-filled reality and casually disappeared into another world.

"I want to repay the kindness of the people in that other world! With an elf who I found collapsed on the road to help at the register, I, the shopkeeper, opened a small shop. The goods I have lined up are from modern society! Sugar and coffee, chainsaws, and plastic bags, today we'll sell all we can!

Our another-world C-mart is full of customers, ranging from our neighbour "oba-chan" to children to dwarf-smiths and even legendary adventurers!?

In my relaxed, slow life as shopkeeper, with a carefree attitude we're open for business today as well!"
