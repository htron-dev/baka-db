## Sinopse

I'm Narajaki Iori who is famous as a crybaby. I'm 17. This is the first time I fall in love and I'm being stuck with it. When I look at my beloved Yusuke, sometimes I daydream(?!) cry and smile.

Iori is too busy for love. Lovey-dovey but in this love which is full of unpredictable things, you have risked your life, Iori!
