    "sinopse": "It is love at first sight for high school student Daichi Miyata when Luka Tachibana transfers into his class. Gorgeous, talented, and popular, Luka is everything he could ever want in a girlfriend. But Daichi has absolutely no idea how to approach her, how to strike up a conversation, or even how to start closing the gap between them.\n\nWhen the two are both selected as class representatives for their school's culture festival, Luka seems overly enthusiastic to spend time with Daichi. As the two begin to draw closer, tensions rise and feelings spill outâ€”and soon their love grows into a blossoming relationship. However, can the two last, and if so, at what cost?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
