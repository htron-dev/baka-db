    "sinopse": "\"Pleasure Mansion\" was a paradise for the monks to release their sexual urges. As a thing to comfort the monks, Shion is the partner of a large crowd of men night after night. \"As long as I can be useful to everyone...\" said Shion while smiling innocently. Seeing that, Munemitsu feels sympathy while also having desires for him; he's falling for the beautiful Shion. Then Shion also begins to be attracted to Munemitsu who's the only person being kind to him. However, Shion's master will never overlook that...\n\n(Source: BComi, translated)",
