Ian and Rin used to just see spirits. Now Ian is one. Using the Fairy Cube, Ian must figure out how to stop the lizard-spirit Tokage from taking over his life and destroying any chance he has of resurrection. Ian is transported to another world by the fairy Ainsel, who promises to help him stop Tokage upon their return to the human plane.
