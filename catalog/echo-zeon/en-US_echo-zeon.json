    "sinopse": "Starting in 1999, this is the story of the high school life of three friends. Yukari is an ambitious girl who loves money. Takao is a big, kind of timid guy who is also an expert at karate. Kanze has the most spectacular talent of all: she can recreate any sound she hears perfectly, whether it's someone's voice or a musical instrument. The three of them spend their high school days solving (or creating) mysteries, taking on cases at the request of other students. Whether they're dealing with kidnappings or school myths, their high school life is anything but dull!\n\n(Source: MU)",
