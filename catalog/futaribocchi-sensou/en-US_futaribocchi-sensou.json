    "sinopse": "Ten years ago an attack by giant monsters called Idola floating in the sky leveled Washington D.C. and awakened humanity to the existence of other live forms. It took years to develop a measure to counter them, via humanoid Idola-derived robots that are controlled by pilots via brain waves.\n\nIlya Kravitz is a young wheelchair-bound kid and prospective pilot taking the pilot examination who lives alone with his sister Anna Kravitz in New York City. Will he manage to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot? How will he fare against the Idola?\n\n(Source: MU)",
