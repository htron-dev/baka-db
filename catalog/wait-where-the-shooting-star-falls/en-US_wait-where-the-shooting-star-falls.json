    "sinopse": "This is Table Land, a mystical world where fallen shooting stars take the form of a witch and are bound to a cat, so when the witch dies, so will the cat. This story begins with a witch's end, but with her still-living cat left behind, and another witch who fell from the skies, soon left alone by the death of her guardian. Forlorn, they both start their lonely search for a place to belong. Will the shadows of the past loom or will the light of hope shine bright? Embark with us now on this curious tale of Table Land...\n\n(Source: Tapas)",
