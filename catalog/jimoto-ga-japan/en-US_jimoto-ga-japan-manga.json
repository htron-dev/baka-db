But when he comes face-to-face with a Japan-obsessed red-haired kid that won't leave him alone until he tells him exactly what prefecture he's from, his life takes a turn for the crazy! This kid isn't just Japan obsessed, he's developed a martial art based on all the different prefectures in the country!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 5: Dohyou ni Saku Bara\nVolume 6: Ningen Usui Kazuomi, Oidemase Yamaguchi, Hide",
