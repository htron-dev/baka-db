    "sinopse": "In the latter half of the Edo period... In a narrow tenement in the humid heat of midsummer, two men exchange heated sighs as they have intercourse. A former kagema, a male prostitute, Momoki, was picked up by Manji one rainy day. The times that Manji spends treating Momoki not as a kagema, but gently, lovingly, holding him as a lover, are much like a dream. To Momoki, those days are filled with happiness, no matter what may have happened in the past.\n\n(Source: MU)",
