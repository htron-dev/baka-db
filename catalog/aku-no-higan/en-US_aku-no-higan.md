## Sinopse

What would you do if money could be exchanged for life? Sell ten years of life for a fortune or give up everything to buy one more year? At the age of 17, a high school boy who has it all together meets a man with superpowers that are both godly and demonic. Through a deadly struggle for his life, he stumbles upon a world "on the other side"! Take a cold look at the fixation on human life in this sharply illustrated dark fantasy!
