    "sinopse": "A thousand years before Christ, the last king of an ancient dynasty had to sacrifice his own life and that of his friends and allies to seal away a demon fox causing chaos in his land and driving people to despair. During the Heian period that golden-haired nine-tailed vixen, known as Daji in China and Kayo in India, whose malign influence led to the dramatic downfall of the governments, reappeared in Japan...\n\nIn Kyoto, a misfortune befalls Mikuzu's family after the head of the household nearly shoots a fox with an arrow. Now Mikuzu, a daughter of a ronin, with a help of her neighbor and a childhood friend Onioumaru, is looking for a way to cure her gravely ill father. Once the demon fox abducts Mikuzu, meaning to recommence her misadventures in a new incarnation, the battle to save the girl and to restore the seal begins.\n\n(Source: MU)",
