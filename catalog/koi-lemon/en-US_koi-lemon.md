## Sinopse

Since his childhood Tamaki has had a medical condition; he gets the hives every time he has skin contact with a girl. One day his sister sends him a life-sized doll so he can use it to masturbate, to his surprise it's alive...and it looks exactly like his favorite eroge heroine, Lemon-chan!
