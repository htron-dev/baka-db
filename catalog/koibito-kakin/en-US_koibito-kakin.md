## Sinopse

Katou is a virgin otaku who is obsessed with romance visual novel games. As he strides his way towards full completion, he finds himself facing a totally new character—who happens to be a man! While Katou struggles to achieve his full completion challenge, a service ticket arrives on his doorstep one fine day. Confused, he follows the instruction on the ticket, heading towards the meeting point, just to find out that the person who is supposed to meet him looks exactly the same as the pretty male character he's been trying to challenge in his game...?
