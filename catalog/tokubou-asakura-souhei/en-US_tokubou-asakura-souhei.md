## Sinopse

Asakura, Souhei is a detective who's job is to get rid of the "pests" in society that harm others. However, his catch phrase is "Ah, I want to die"...and he's a downer, loves to eat eggs, plus he uses a rope to snare these "pests" - literally!

With unconventional methods and a rope to tie up the bad guys, Asakura teams up with a young police man named Tsuji, Keiichi under the orders of his somewhat sadistic boss Kanou, Miyuki. Hilarity ensues in this off beat detective series!
