    "sinopse": "Asakura, Souhei is a detective who's job is to get rid of the \"pests\" in society that harm others. However, his catch phrase is \"Ah, I want to die\"...and he's a downer, loves to eat eggs, plus he uses a rope to snare these \"pests\" - literally!\n\nWith unconventional methods and a rope to tie up the bad guys, Asakura teams up with a young police man named Tsuji, Keiichi under the orders of his somewhat sadistic boss Kanou, Miyuki. Hilarity ensues in this off beat detective series!\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nKazuhiro-chan no Ekaki Kouza",
