## Sinopse

A new government project is starting, where former convicts are relocated to towns without the knowledge of the citizens who live there. The trial city is Uoboka, a small town that was once a busy seaport. Now, 11 former violent criminals are being relocated to the town, and the only ones who know are the mayor and his friends. What could go wrong?
