## Sinopse

Isekai Tennis Musou follows a high school tennis prodigy who is summoned to another world as a hero and finds it unimpressive when compared to the high school tennis nationals. Tennis is the most powerful superpower in this world: with his tennis skills he can crush a dragon with one hit or defeat an army of demons. But the demon king is also a tennis player.
