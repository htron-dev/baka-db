## Sinopse

Koisuru Savanna is a love story about a good-looking young man who indiscriminately gets involved with many different women, earning him the title of “beast” from his female coworkers. He claims he’s looking for a suitable partner he can become crazy about. He then meets the poker-faced Houjou who casually responds to his advances. What exactly is she thinking?
