## Sinopse

Clare had thought that Denzil Black was intent on seducing her sister -- after her best friend had already fallen prey to his charms. It was almost as if the film director were a vampire lover, moving from one woman to another, and leaving them drained and helpless. Then Clare began to suspect that she was next on Denzil's list of conquests -- but not if she could help it... This time, Denzil Black would know what it was like to be the victim of love!
