## Sinopse

Raised in the hope that I would be a boy full of courage and strength, they named me "Yuu." To be a girl filled with kindness and love; that's how my twin sister, "Ai," was raised.

That's how our parents named us - But... Our parents' wishes were reversed.

A story about twins who risk everything to protect one another and to find his or her happiness in the switch they call twins game.
