## Sinopse

DeroDero is the story of a juvenile delinquent, Hino Mimio, who happens to also be a psychic. His ability to communicate with the spiritual world as well as his demeanors caused him to constantly interact with supernatural beings -- usually ending up with Mimio beating the crap out of the monster or spirit.
