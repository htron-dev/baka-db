    "sinopse": "Following the conclusion of the first Division Rap Battle, Ramuda Amemura and Jakurai Jinguji return to their respective divisions, further honing their rapping skills for the next tournament. After gambling all of his money, Dice Arisugawa finds himself without a single yen to pay back his debt to his friends. Moping around, he meets a mysterious person who offers him cash in exchange for transporting boxes to a Yokohama port at night. Ramuda and Gentarou Yumeno assume the worst when Dice requests their assistance, but decide to go along out of curiosity.\n\nElsewhere, a young kid approaches Doppo Kannonzaka on his way home from work, insisting that he take them to go see Jakurai. The kid's older brother was abducted by a Yokohama gang, and they are demanding a ransom. Informing him of the urgent news, Jakurai, with Doppo and Hifumi Izanami at his side, sets out to confront the gang in the middle of the night.\n\nWhen the two teams arrive at the scene, they find old friends and enemies awaiting them. Sensing that there is someone behind the incidents, Ramuda and Jakurai are more determined than ever to uncover the truth.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
