## Sinopse

H-Era, Year 3: Following the events of the first Division Rap Battle, the Party of Words sends invitations to two more divisions to participate in the next iteration. Among the recipients are Sasara Nurude and Kuko Harai—former associates of Ichirou Yamada and Samatoki Aohitsugi. Given a chance to face their previous group members, the two set out to form new teams to represent the Osaka and Nagoya divisions respectively.

Sasara finds himself allying with his former comedy partner, Rosho Tsutsujimori, and a mysterious conman, Rei Ayamado, to create Dotsuitare Hompo. On the other hand, Kuko works with lawyer Hitoya Amaguni and visual kei musician Jyushi Aimono to form Bad Ass Temple. While the two new divisions begin to work together to improve their rap abilities, they learn more about the creation of the "Hypnosis Microphones." As the other divisions are pulled into the fray, the truth behind the breakup of The Dirty Dawg and the government's intentions with the Division Rap Battles continues to be revealed.
