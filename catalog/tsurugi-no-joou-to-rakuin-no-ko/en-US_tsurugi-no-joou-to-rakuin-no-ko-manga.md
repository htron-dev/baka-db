## Sinopse

"Stay with me forever!"

Chris is a boy who had been born with "brand of beast", a mark that eaten away the fate of surrounding, on his hand and forehead. He was wandering around the battle field as a mercenary, but encounter with certain girl changes everything. The one who appears in front of him was a girl wearing a white robe wielding a large sword, named Minerva. She was a fearful legendary swordsman who can foresee the future and had a overwhelming sword technique. "So, you're the one who'll kill me" That night, by fate of Minerva, she should have been killed by Chris, but her fate was twisted by Chris's brand.
