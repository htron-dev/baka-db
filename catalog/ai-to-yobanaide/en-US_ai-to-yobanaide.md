## Sinopse

Clare was saved by millionaire Jack Straker six years ago and stayed with him afterward. When his gravely ill father died one day, she slept with him to console him. The following day, he thanked her and handed her a check. Adding to her mortification, he told her he was married. What an insult! Years later, she runs into him again, and now she has a secret she'll never tell him, not when he doesn't know what real love is...
