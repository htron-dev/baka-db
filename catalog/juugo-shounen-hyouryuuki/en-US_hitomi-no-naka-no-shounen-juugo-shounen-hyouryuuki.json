    "sinopse": "A two-week summer vacation has turned out to be a long struggle for survival.\n\n“The Story of 15 Boys” is based on \"Deux Ans de Vacances\", a unique masterpiece and the only novel that Jules Verne wrote especially for children. Now this story has been animated through the use of leading-edge techniques.\n\nA drifting sailboat carrying 15 boys is overtaken by a storm and cast ashore on a desert island, where the fifteen boys begin their struggle. Their tough days-full of danger, thrills and fear-drive the boys to distress at times, but also shape them into strong independent people.\n\nThe boys' extraordinary experiences on the island will bring to all young viewers the excitement that they always dream of experiencing themselves.\n\n(Source: Official Website)",
