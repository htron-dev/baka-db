## Sinopse

Mikami loves games, and has a talent for making them too. He enrolled into a computer club just to make a game. His childhood friend Itsuki is worried about what his future will hold for him. One day he went to buy a game for resource to make a galge. On the way back in the train, he bumps into someone and drops his games all over the floor, but someone helped him to pick them up. When he got home and checked for his games, he found a game that he didn't recognize buying, "Not Alive." When he tried to take out the disk to play it, something strange occurred and it went into his body. By the time he realized anything was going on, he had been transferred into a game as a girl, and thrown into battle!
