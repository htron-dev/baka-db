## Sinopse

Meet Constance, a scrupulous and by-the-book accountant. When she's assigned to investigate a casino's finances, she visits the casino with the bad reputation. If there are any illegal activities afoot, she's confident she'll uncover them. Then, she meets John Fairweather, the CEO of the casino. Flashing an irresistible smile, he compliments her and plants his lips on hers! Is this the game he'll play to undermine her work? Bewildered by John's uninhibited behavior, Constance can't entirely suppress her desire for him... though she's acutely aware that she'd lose everything if she ever got involved with him.
