    "sinopse": "Hellsing, an organization devoted to the elimination of the vampire threat, has recently uncovered information regarding the attempted production of \"man-made\" undead. The world is presently in the thick of WWII, and the current leader of Hellsing fears the Nazis could potentially use these creatures as front-line super-soldiers. Although the technology of creating artificial vampires is still in its infancy, it has advanced enough to be a serious threat. In an attempt to put a stop to this perverse and dangerous experimentation, Hellsing has sent two of its most skillful agents to Poland. A young man by the name of Walter C. Dornes - a.k.a. \"The Angel of Death,\" and Alucard, an ancient vampire currently in forced service to the Hellsing Organization. Together, they attempt to stop the progress of the Nazi's efforts.\n\n(Source: Vimanga.ru)",
