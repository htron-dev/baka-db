    "sinopse": "From matchlocks and cellphones to kimono and TV games, the cultures are blended, a modern Era with an “Inner Palace” inside the Osaka castle!?\n\nThe only son of the Toyotomi Shogun, Hidekage, on mission with the inspection bureau “Carrion Cafeteria – Vulture”, infiltrated this harem where pretty girls are gathered. However, the girls he saw there, were fighting for show, watched from outside an aquarium-like glass case. Those are not regular beauties! This is the start of a never experienced before forbidden school life!\n\n(Source: Batoto)",
