## Sinopse

Sayuri is a curious creature who lives on her husband with her equally surreal mother and father. With an antenna-like whip protruding from her head, she is a striking daughter, and her long-awaited time to strike has come. Her family and friends watch eagerly as Sayuri carries out this bizarre ceremony.
