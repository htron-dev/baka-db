    "sinopse": "Ogata, a nice and hardworking man, has only one problem... His love for Takasugi, another man. But by telling Takasugi about his feelings, the problem should be gone. Yet another problem arises: Takasugi believes their feelings are too alike and that they therefore can't be together. But who knows what can happen when two men in love go away on a vacation together—both determined to win the seducing game.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
