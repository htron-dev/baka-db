Cover summary:
Street Fighter III: Ryu Final explores Ryu's past, as he seeks the path of the warrior. On his journey he'll train with many fighters; the mystical hermit Oro, the wise martial arts master Gouken... even his good friend Ken might teach him a few new tricks! It all comes to a head with Ryu's first encounter with the man who would one day become his greatest foe... the deadly Akuma!

Note: The Japanese tankoubon includes a bonus short manga called "THE KANZUKI" (an all-new short story focused on Kazuki Karin) (B-U)
