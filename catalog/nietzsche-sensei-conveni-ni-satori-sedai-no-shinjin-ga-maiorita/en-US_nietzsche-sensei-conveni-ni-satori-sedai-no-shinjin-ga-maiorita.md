## Sinopse

The comedy manga follows a male part-time late-night convenience store worker named Matsukoma, and the new part-time worker he trains named Tomoharu Nii, nicknamed Nietzsche-sensei. Tomoharu is a university student in the school's Buddhism department. When an angry customer screams at Tomoharu, "Customers are gods!," he replies, "God is dead." The manga follows the part-time worker life of Matsukoma and Tomoharu, the latter of whom continuously baffles his customers and co-workers at the convenience store with his odd ways.
