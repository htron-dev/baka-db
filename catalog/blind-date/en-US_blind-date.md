## Sinopse

Catherine knew her sister meant well, but a blind date with a famous, handsome tycoon was not exactly what she needed. Zack Freeman was equally annoyed when his best friend defied him to leave work behind for a moment and have a little fun. When they met, Catherine saw desire in Zack's eyes, and it was clear he found her irresistible. Both were surprised to find their blind date turn into one unforgettable night with consequences that would change both their lives!
