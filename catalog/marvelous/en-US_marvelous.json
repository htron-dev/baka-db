    "sinopse": "MARVELOUS is a manga whose art style follows closely that of the great 70s shonen sports manga, replete with strong lines, charismatic hair, and tremendous action scenes—but with all the tongue-in-cheek wry humor of a modern manga. The hero of MARVELOUS is a young man named Hitotsuya Yuu, who aspires to become a world class boxer. His current task is to find a gym that will train and polish him into a real champ. The first gym he finds is a small, run-down joint that he winds up saving from creditors, yet for some reason, the strange old proprietor warns him against training there. Ex-champion boxer Akagi Tetsu, once of that old gym, finds Yuu, and follows Yuu to a different gym, where Yuu shows himself to be a boxer of incredible raw talent and determination. But something extraordinary happens when Tetsu and Yuu see a certain story on TV about a world-famous boxing trainer called \"the Kaiser\"—a Japanese man who has raised up many champions, but whose heart is ruled purely by profit and not one bit of love for his trainees. The Kaiser has just dumped another champion for money and, oddly enough, his full nickname is \"Kaiser Hitotsuya.\" That's when Tetsu discovers our hero Hitotsuya Yuu is burning with overwhelming rage, apparently against his namesake...
