## Sinopse

From Nagareboshi Manga:
The student council is full of strange, quirky people with clashing personalities. One person in particular, Tsubaki Kiyoi (nicknamed Tsubakiyo), has a special talent that only one other person knows about-- when she touches someone, she can access their thoughts and memories. But because of this talent, she is very introverted and damaged inside. Can she overcome her fear of coming in contact with other humans, and take control of her power?
