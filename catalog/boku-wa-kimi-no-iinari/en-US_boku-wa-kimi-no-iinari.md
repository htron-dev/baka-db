## Sinopse

"I'm the only one who gets to see you so filthy, when you're usually so serious." Danno realizes he's gay in junior high school and professes his love to his crush, but is deeply hurt by rejection. Still disgusted by himself in his second year of high school, he ends up falling for another guy that spring. He tries to keep from being found out and to stop his feelings developing any further by pushing away the object of his affections, first-year student Tsukasa. One day, Tsukasa finds Danno jerking off in the nurse's office. "Does it turn you on? Being watched by your crush?" Tsukasa's torturing and teasing makes Danno dizzy with pleasure, robbing him of coherent thought!
