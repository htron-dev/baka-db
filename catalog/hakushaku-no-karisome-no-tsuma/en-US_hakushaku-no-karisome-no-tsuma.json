    "sinopse": "Jewelry designer Tamara once again finds herself face-to-face with the Earl of Melton at a party. He's the CEO of a hugely successful company, with a strong build and masculine features, not to mention her father's choice to be her husband! With the confidence of a conquering hero, once again he asks for her hand in marriage. Although she refuses him right away, in order to save the business she has worked so hard to start, eventually she agrees. They hatch a plan to become husband and wife for half a year, each pursuing their own business goals—him, a successful merger with her father's company, her, a steady list of clientele—but can Tamara resist his passionate act?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
