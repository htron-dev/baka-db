    "sinopse": "Manga adaptation by Rin Ogata, based on Anne Stuart's novel \"Heart's Ease.\"\n\nCassandra O'Neill, also known as Cassie, was appalled and shocked when she was falsely accused of tampering with lab results in her job as a researcher. She had always done meticulous work and was extremely hurt when her co-workers chose to believe the worst and not listen to the truth. To compound her misfortune, Cassie's loyal friend Meredith was involved in a serious auto crash and Cassie had to fly to Virginia immediately. When Meredith's brother Bran picked Cassie up at the airport, she sensed an underlying mistrust - almost as though he hated her from first sight. If only she could have known what effect Bran's true feelings would have on her . . .\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
