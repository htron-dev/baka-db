    "sinopse": "Kei Arimoto and Makoto Ohtaki had been bosom buddies since middle school, but their relationship begins to change as college forces the two to spend more time apart. Kei is using all his wiles to take their relationship to the next level but Makoto continues to resist a more physical connection. Can Makoto finally acquiesce to Kei’s advances or will he find his soul mate stolen by a formidable rival instead? “Love Soul” shows that their paths to true love and positions in bed can be ambiguous and painfully funny.\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nLove Is a Question, Double Face",
