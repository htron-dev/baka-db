## Sinopse

"Summer, ghosts, and my feelings for you."

Yamano is a second-year high schooler in love. One day, out of nowhere, the very object of his affection, Tanigawa, appeared in front of him. As a ghost. It seems that she died after being involved in some kind of incident.

To save Tanigawa from death, Yamano gets busy trying to change her future, but—

A vague and fleeting youthful mystery.
