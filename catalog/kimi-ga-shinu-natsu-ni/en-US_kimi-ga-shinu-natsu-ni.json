    "sinopse": "\"Summer, ghosts, and my feelings for you.\"\n\nYamano is a second-year high schooler in love. One day, out of nowhere, the very object of his affection, Tanigawa, appeared in front of him. As a ghost. It seems that she died after being involved in some kind of incident.\n\nTo save Tanigawa from death, Yamano gets busy trying to change her future, but—\n\nA vague and fleeting youthful mystery.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa)",
