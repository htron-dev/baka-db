    "sinopse": "On his way home from his office, the main protagonist drove and ran over a big dog. At that moment, he suddenly heard a voice inside his head. \"The monster has been defeated, you have gained experience points.\" \"Eh?\" Before anyone knew, the world had changed. Monsters appear, this is a game-like world where levels, skills, and status exist. This is an adventure where the modern world becomes fantasy and where the main protagonist has to strive hard for his survival.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
