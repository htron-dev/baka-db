    "sinopse": "Don't make me take my uniform off...! Haru's number one at the place where he works at. They offer carnal services from \"high school boys.\" Despite his cute looks, when he's behind the tinted mirror, he lets his pink tongue glide over the glass, plays with himself, and uses his hand to pleasure himself while seducing his customers on the other side. For Haru, this is the job he was born to do. He's legally an adult, but he wants to be loved as a high school boy... One day, Takashiro comes to him as a new customer. Takashiro is handsome, good at his work, and popular with both men and women. He's the \"perfect\" guy that everyone wants to be. Except he has a secret. He can only get excited with high school boys.\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
