## Sinopse

Cute and popular, Nanoka seems to be the type of girl who could get any boy using her so called "tactics". Accepting confessions and dumping at the snap of a finger, she's never been truly in love. Until now. How can she catch this sempai's attention when she can't keep herself composed enough to use her so called tactics?
