    "sinopse": "Yajima, a project lead in the design department, is swamped with work by Mita, his newly arrived boss from hell. Every day, he doesn't even have enough time to eat a meal! When he becomes unable to endure his empty stomach and starts having snacks at his desk, Mita orders that snacking during work hours is prohibited! Yajima takes offense at this unreasonable order, but by accident, learns that Mita has a strange sexual fetish that means he gets aroused... by seeing people eat?!\n\n(Source: Kaiohsha, translated)",
