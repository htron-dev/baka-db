## Sinopse

Two laborotory-assistants, Zen Amako, Shuichi Aiga and their daughters boss Shoko Yobuno are connected with the triangle edged sacred animal mirror.
They are also pure-blooded demons and siblings off each other, allthough they are unaware off these facts.

This mirror will connect with two pure-blooded male demons. One (Zen) off them will cause Horobi (world destruction) and the other (Shuichi) will save the world and destroy Zen.
