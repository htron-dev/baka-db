## Sinopse

The devil tempts... and the humans are tempted. If there is love between them, it will be a curse. Evilice and Sin are shadowy but attractive characters who have lived countless time for their collections. Evilice collects items that are cursed, and Sin ones used for murder. Though they compete for the same items most of the times, they have the opposite feelings towards only one item: an old doll. It is a cursed woman who Evilice loved and ruined, and who Sin is jealous of. With stories of sinister items, their secret spreads!
