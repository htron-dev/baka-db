Since his physical needs are taken care of by Rinya, Hakana feels no desire to tie himself down with a serious relationship until Rinya’s ex-lover shows up and wants a second chance. Suddenly, just being friends isn’t enough for Hakana, but can the two of them handle taking things to the next level?\n\n(Source: DMG)",
