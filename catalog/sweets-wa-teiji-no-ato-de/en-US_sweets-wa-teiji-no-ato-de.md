## Sinopse

Reika has it all—she's a model-tall cool beauty with a high-powered job at her sweets company. But it's precisely because of all that that she's never had a boyfriend...men find her too unapproachable, or beg her to be their mistress, in the S&M sort of way. But when she meets a young coworker, Hasegawa-kun, she happens to find out that they have more in common than just their job, including secrets...
