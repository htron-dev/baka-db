## Sinopse

A young Japanese man once ran away to Broadway and became the extremely famous actor Hades, who played the role of Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar. Now, he's back in Japan and living like a bum, using his voice and charisma to trick women. One day, though, he comes face to face with a big surprise-- a teenage daughter he knew nothing about! Lisa also longs to become a famous actor, and is currently playing the role of "Maria" in The Sound of Music. However, she holds a deep hatred for the father who abandoned her mother to raise a child alone.
