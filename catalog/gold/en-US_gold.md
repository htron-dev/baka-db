## Sinopse

Mars knows that nothing will stop him from tracking down his wife, Chantal, who'd betrayed him and sent him to prison for a crime he didn't commit. Chantal had died--or so everyone said--but Mars knew she'd merely transformed herself and reemerged into the spotlight as supermodel Mischief Jones.
Mars was a hard man, a bitter one, who'd survived by shutting off his emotions. But when he finally captured the woman he'd been hunting, the bewitching seductress with the luminous eyes denied everything. He was falling under her spell. Who was she really --an angel... or a cunningly brilliant counterfeit with an agenda of her own?
Based on Ann Major's novel, "Secret Child".
