## Sinopse

Hanayama Chie falls in love with classmate Himeno Torajirou at first sight. Originally mistaking Himeno for a girl, Hanayama tries various ways to approach him and before he knows it, he turns into some perverted stalker! Contrary to his appearance, Himeno is manly and sadistic, while Hanayama’s good looks are just for show. A high school romcom filled with gender misunderstandings begins!
