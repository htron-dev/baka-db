## Sinopse

The witch, Marika, was exiled from the spirit world for committing a taboo in order to save the human child, Ryou. She mustn't get involved with human beings so that she may return to her world. However, Marika falls in love with Ryou and plays "make-believe" with him when night falls. Due to witch law, they are only able to go as far as touching each other's bodies. Which direction will this unforgivable and forbidden love take?
