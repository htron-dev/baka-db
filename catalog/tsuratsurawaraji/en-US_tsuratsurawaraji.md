## Sinopse

To control his daimyo lords, the shogun orders them to move back and forth from their provincial home and the capital, where they must spend half their time. The story follows the long journeys of the daimyo Kumada's family between the family's Okayama home in southwestern Japan and their second home in the capital. (Source: ANN)
