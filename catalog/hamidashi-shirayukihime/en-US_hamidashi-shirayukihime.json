    "sinopse": "Based on Debbie Macomber's novel \"Almost Paradise\"\n\nTo fun-loving Sherry White, a summer camp for intellectually gifted children seemed the perfect getaway from the smothering influence of her wacky but well-intentioned stepmother. But she soon realized that sharing a cabin with seven precocious little girls and a contraband hamster, under the watchful eye of Camp Gitche Gumee's gorgeous, disapproving director, Jeff Roarke, was more than child's play.\n\nRoarke's businesslike attitude and crack-of-dawn staff meetings were anything but relaxing. Still, a midnight lakeside rendezvous had Sherry atingle in a way she was certain ran counter to Roarke's strict antiromance policy. Dare she risk falling under the spell of this unwilling prince?\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
