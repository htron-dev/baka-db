## Sinopse

Being reprimanded by everyone she encounters, Sawa Mitoma has fallen under the impression that she is nothing but a burden. On her first day of high school, Sawa causes even more trouble when her teacher catches her being tardy. This distressing situation results in her meeting fellow students and members of the Souma clan: the charming Mutsuki and outspoken Haijime.

Fruits Basket: Another follows Sawa as she attempts to confront her inner demons and insecurities with the support of the Soumas.
