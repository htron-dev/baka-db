## Sinopse

In feudal Japan, Hyouta used to be a traveling acrobat. He meets Ushiwakamaru, an ill boy of royalty who is being held captive by the lord of that land. As they look exactly alike, Hyouta agrees to swap places, but when Ushiwakamaru dies of his illness, Hyouta agrees to carry on his dream and stay in his position.

Years later, Hyouta has become Minamotono Yoshitsune and with his advisors, Musashibou Benkei and Isesaburou Yoshimori, he brings peace to his lands by solving crimes and problems. A secret messenger arrives to see Yoshitsune and informs him of a coming war. This is Yoshitsune's story in one of the biggest wars in feudal Japan.
