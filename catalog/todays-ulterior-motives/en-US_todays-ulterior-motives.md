## Sinopse

Volume 1: Today's Ulterior Motives
(Kyou mo Dokokade Himitsu no Jouji)
The lover of the beginner actor Makoto Aizawa is Sanari Jonouchi, screenwriter and producer behind the mega-famous theatrical troupe "Saiho." The first lesson(?) Makoto learned when they met at a hot spring resort had more to do with sex than actual acting! What began there was sexual harassment under the name of acting lessons. But even though Jonouchi is toying with the obedient and innocent Makoto using dubiously slick, premature rhetoric, Makoto believes every bit of it! Join a producer with a penetrating tongue and a defenseless novice actor in this teacher-student romance. (Source: DMP)

Tomorrow's Ulterior Motives (Ashita mo Dokokade Aimitsu no Jouji)
