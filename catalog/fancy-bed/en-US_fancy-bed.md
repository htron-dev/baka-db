## Sinopse

Recently, Yuu has been troubled by his lover, who by appearance comes across as the cool handsome type but carries within him the heart of a girl. Because they're now living together, rooms are starting to fill up with stuffed toys and the smallest thing makes Kure cry. His "girly moments" are getting excessive and escalating. Finally reaching his limit, Yuu suddenly starts talking about breaking up...!?
