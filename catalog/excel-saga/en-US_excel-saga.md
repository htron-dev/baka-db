## Sinopse

When discussing conquest, Il Palazzo's motto would most likely be "start small." ACROSS, a group devoted to carrying out and accomplishing the ideals of absent-minded yet bishounen Il Palazzo, feels that the first step in conquering the entire planet would be conquering a single city. This city just so happens to be Fukuoka, where our story takes place.
