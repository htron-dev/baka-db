## Sinopse

Do you know the three signs that prove you're in love? How do you get the person you love to love you back? Is there such a thing as a Love for D\*mmies guide?

Kendo strongwoman and defender of The Bullied Komachi transfers to Kirifuda High in hot pursuit of Nozomi, her first love. She applied for the martial arts department like Nozomi, so how come she ends up in...the Love Class?? What the heck is a "Love Class"?? Komachi blames Nikaido, the arrogant student council president for the misfit.
