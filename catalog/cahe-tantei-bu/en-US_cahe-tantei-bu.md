## Sinopse

Tsubamegaoka Private Academy—all girls' high school located just inside the city, famous for it's large number of clubs. From the common ones to some freakishly impressive ones. It's always okay to make one, no matter what kind of club, and it's not uncommon to see students join this school for the sole purpose of making a new club. But what happens when five girls want to make a club and there's only one place left for new club to be created?
