## Sinopse

"A special human girl is born once every one thousand years, and the one that marries her will become the one true king."

Ever since Shin Ji-Ahn and Yi-Ahn's mother passed away, the two have become different and distant people. After a fight, Ji-Ahn's father makes her promise to make up with Yi-Ahn, and come back home hand-in-hand.

When Yi-Ahn is kidnapped to become the Goblin's wife, Ji-Ahn vows to bring Yi-Ahn back home no matter what. Even if it means venturing through the land of human-eating monsters ruled by four cruel brothers—who all aim to become king.
