After a fight, Ji-Ahn's father makes her promise to make up with Yi-Ahn, and come back home hand-in-hand.\n\nWhen Yi-Ahn is kidnapped to become the Goblin's wife, Ji-Ahn vows to bring Yi-Ahn back home no matter what. Even if it means venturing through the land of human-eating monsters ruled by four cruel brothers—who all aim to become king.",
