## Sinopse

Yosuke Shinkai is haunted by a past he cannot recall...and a body that is rapidly decomposing. He is a living corpse, unclear who he is or why he has been brought back to life only to suffer again a slow gruesome death. A grotesque and disturbing account of life after horrific death, told by Japan's undisputed master of horror manga, and appearing here for the first time in English translation.
