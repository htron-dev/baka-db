## Sinopse

Owada, an ordinary boy and also the "Villager A" in his class, can't help but be curious about Katou, a boy who belongs to the "Royalties" sitting behind him. Owada gathers up his courage and tries to talk to him, but Katou just ignores him with crystal-like eyes. However, one day, Owada accidentally touches Katou-kun's secret that no one knows...!
