## Sinopse

Arisa is a first-year high-schooler obsessed with the idea of a "real romance." The sign she is waiting for is the comfort and familiarity of someone's touch. When she is saved at the school festival by her senpai, Kyousuke, she grows interested in him but he doesn't seem to believe in destiny at all.
