    "sinopse": "In the future, computers and their components have become as small as threads, and there are groups of world famous fashion designers making clothing out of them. The Designers have Models, girls who wear these computer-clothes and who duke it out in a series of competitions called the War King, to determine who is the world’s best Designer and Model. Fargas is one such Designer, the son of a famous one, who is now sick and dying and needs medical care. All of this costs money, which the family doesn’t have, living in the slums of the city. But what Fargas doesn’t know is that his fraternal twin sister, Jennifer, who was seperated from him at birth, has the ability to Model - and when put together, they make an unbeatable team. Will Fargas become a world-class Designer? Can Jennifer, who has never Modeled before, enter the War King and beat other famous and deadly Models competing against her? Can they both save their father from untimely death?\n\n(Source: MU)",
