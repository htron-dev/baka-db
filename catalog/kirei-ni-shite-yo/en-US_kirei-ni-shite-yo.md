## Sinopse

The thing Dai Hara hates the most is people. To him, every single person is troublesome. He was bullied and bothered so much throughout middle school that he debuted as a delinquent in high school. However, whether he's plain or flashy, it seems the only person who isn't bothersome is the janitor.
