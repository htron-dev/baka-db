## Sinopse

In the year 2045, VR-capable brain implanted communication terminals have become widespread. With the advent of this world changing technology, the world has become an almost unrecognizable place. From e-sex indistinguishable from the real thing to advanced artificial intelligence, it seems anything has become possible. Except for, of course, the redemption of my pathetic love life.
