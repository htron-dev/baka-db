## Sinopse

Yamashita, somewhat neurotic, and hates ants for a certain reason. His neighbor, Shimabara (expressionless bug-lover) invites himself in to “watch over the ants”... Wait, is this a little bit like living together!? “How could you go into the place where a person is most vulnerable...?” Unperturbed and air-headed, Shimabara who he depends on enters Yamashita's heart... ♥ A collection of a hot author's interesting and lovable characters and love stories. ♥
