## Sinopse

"For the first time in six years, I'll be coming home...to witness your marriage to the duke." The long-awaited letter that young Evelyn received from Sam didn't contain the answer she was hoping for. When she was fifteen, Sam was her first kiss and her first love. But she can only assume it was a goodbye gesture before he left to study medicine overseas. Suppressing her lingering passion, Evelyn decides to try her best to form a new loving relationship with the duke. However, Sam, now a skilled and handsome doctor, struggles with his developing feelings for Eve as he hides a dark secret that will change their relationship forever...
