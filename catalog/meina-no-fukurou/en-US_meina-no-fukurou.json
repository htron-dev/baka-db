    "sinopse": "In the spring of her junior year of high school, Matsuo Meina moves from Okinawa to Tokyo. Meina is to live with her older cousin, Aki, who she has always had a crush on and hasn't seen in years. But to Meina's surprise, Aki has a pet owl, Muffler, living with him in the house. Aki is doing research on owls at his university; he's also an extreme owl enthusiast. Meina, however, has had issues with birds ever since she was young. She's never had to deal with owls, let alone live with one!\n\n(Source: MU)",
