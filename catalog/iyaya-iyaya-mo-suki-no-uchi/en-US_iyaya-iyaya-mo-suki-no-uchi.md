## Sinopse

Who would've thought Masumi, the king of poker faces and a bit of an enigma, had a thing for Yuki? Yuki certainly didn't until Masumi decided to tell him one day. Yuki finds it hard to believe because Masumi is popular with women and is even rumored to have a girlfriend. As Yuki panics, Masumi lets him know that he finds it adorable how expressive Yuki is with his face. Yuki's never been with a guy, so he rejects Masumi at first, but as Masumi keeps confessing his hot, passionate feelings for him, he starts to develop some feelings of his own for the guy...!!
