## Sinopse

After breaking up with his boyfriend, a depressed Asuka propositions the first man he comes across. Tamamura, who has a secret foot fetish, rejects him initially but gets turned on by the sight if Asuka's bare feet and succumbs to his desires. The next day, Asuka thinks his encounter with Tamamura is best forgotten as a one night stand, but it seems Tamamura, enamoured with Asuka's feet, is not willing to let go...?
