## Sinopse

A virus that is spreading throughout the world causes those infected to be driven by an impulse to perform semi-forceful acts of courtship. Fuyu Nemoto, a plain office lady who couldn't be further removed from romance but still wishes for some stimulation in her life, decides to participate in marriage hunting. However, she is unable to get even those infected with the virus to look at her...?!
