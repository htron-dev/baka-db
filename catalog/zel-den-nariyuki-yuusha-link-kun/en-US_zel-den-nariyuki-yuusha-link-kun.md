## Sinopse

The comic follows the misadventures of Link and his efforts in avoiding his responsibility of saving the world. The first part takes place in Termina just moments before the Moon crashes into the land. Link uses the Ocarina of Time to turn back time, but only so he can keep playing on his Nintendo 3DS.
