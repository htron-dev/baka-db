    "sinopse": "Once upon a time, there was a boy who was bullied by his peers because of his honest, straightforward personality. This boy was befriended by a brother-and-sister duo who vowed to be his friends forever. Unfortunately, the boy's family moves away, leading to their fledgling bond being severed.\n\nYears later, the honest boy has found the perfect way to make 'friends,' be admired by students and teachers alike, and avoid being picked on: maintaining a false personality as the \"School Prince\" while carefully hiding his quarrelsome, devil-may-care attitude from the public eye. But his peaceful - albeit mind-numbingly boring and somewhat lonely - days are thrown completely out-of-whack when a pair of twins transfers into his school.\n\n(Source: MU)",
