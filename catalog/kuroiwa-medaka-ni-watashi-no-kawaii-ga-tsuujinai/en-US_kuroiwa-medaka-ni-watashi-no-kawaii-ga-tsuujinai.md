## Sinopse

Born and raised in Osaka, Mona moved to Tokyo to enjoy her high school life to the fullest. Hiding her country accent and going full throttle on her feminine charm, she's dead-set on becoming the queen bee and making every single guy fall for her! But what's a girl to do when her classmate Medaka Kuroiwa refuses to look her way, no matter how darnin' hard she tries...?
