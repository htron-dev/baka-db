## Sinopse

Kazamatsuri Touma's favourite quiet cafe — where she reads recently bought books — will soon close, so she and Kageyama Torako look for another quiet place for Touma to read. Torako suggests the cake cafe nearby. And as it turns out the two girls really love the European cakes there, and can not resist trying them all out.
