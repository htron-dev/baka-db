    "sinopse": "Childhood friends Yuu and Asa used to take for granted that they would always be together. However, one day, that certainty was suddenly proven wrong.\n\n\"A suffocating feeling of restlessness. Why?\"\n\nYuu felt it wasn't something he could continue enduring forever. Gradually, he couldn't help but realize his feelings went beyond a simple childhood friendship, and that came as a shock. Yuu, who thought that falling for Asa would be a nuisance for the people around him in those changing circumstances, chose to forget his love for him and play the part of an ordinary childhood friend.\n\n(Source: Intelfin, translated)",
