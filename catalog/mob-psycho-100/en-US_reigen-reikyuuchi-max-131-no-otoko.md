## Sinopse

Meet the self-proclaimed exorcist, spiritualist, and psychic himself. What he lacks in strength, he makes up for in charisma. What he lacks in bravery, he makes up for in ingenuity. What he lacks in heroism, he makes up for with massages and life advice. This is the story of Arataka Reigen and the Spirits and Such Consultation Office.
