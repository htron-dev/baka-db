    "sinopse": "Clumsy high school student Rintarou Noe has a problem: he has a difficult time dealing with his home tutor, Kaede Sumizome, and the strange feeling he gets whenever he gets too close to him. So, he decides the best way to make him quit is by failing his exams on purpose. Unfortunately for him, Kaede sees through his plan, and thus, Rintarou lies on the pretext that he failed because he was bored since he had not been able to go out much nor have fun at all. However, Kaede does not take this lightly and goes as far as to punish Rintarou. How will this affect their relationship?\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Yuuutsu Trickster (2 chapters)",
