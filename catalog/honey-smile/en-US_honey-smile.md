## Sinopse

You can never get enough of a precious person's smile. Takizawa is a dissatisfied lawyer who deals with juvenile delinquents. He has a job, money, "playmates", and yet he's still dogged by the feeling that his life just isn't fulfilling. Then one day a young part-timer invites Takizawa to lunch, and with each meal his heart begins to soften. Honey\*Smile is the love story of a world-weary man and a former juvenile delinquent that transcends their differing ages.
