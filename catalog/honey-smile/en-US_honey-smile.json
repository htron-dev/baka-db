    "sinopse": "You can never get enough of a precious person's smile. Takizawa is a dissatisfied lawyer who deals with juvenile delinquents. He has a job, money, \"playmates\", and yet he's still dogged by the feeling that his life just isn't fulfilling. Then one day a young part-timer invites Takizawa to lunch, and with each meal his heart begins to soften. Honey\\*Smile is the love story of a world-weary man and a former juvenile delinquent that transcends their differing ages.\n\n(Source: Jun√©)",
