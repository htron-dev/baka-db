## Sinopse

Akira Kousaka was a lecturer for Tokyo Art University. Ever since he read about the Imperial Eggs, he wanted to visit Prussia to look at it with his own eyes. Finally with the winter break, he was able to go to Irina Art Museum in Prussia where the Imperial Eggs were displayed. Little did he knew that just by triggering the alarm system, his life would forever be changed with a single encounter.
