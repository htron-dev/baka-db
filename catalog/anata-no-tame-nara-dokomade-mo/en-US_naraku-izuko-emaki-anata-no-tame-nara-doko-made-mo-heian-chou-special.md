## Sinopse

The serious and straight-laced government official of the Capital and Officer in the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards, Takaichiho no Takumi, just can't ignore the annoying fake onmyouji, Nanatsumi no Hirokazu, who keeps hitting on him. And now he's forced to work on an accident involving ayakashis! But for the pervert Nanatsumi, he uses every chance he has to turn the situation into a dirty one!
