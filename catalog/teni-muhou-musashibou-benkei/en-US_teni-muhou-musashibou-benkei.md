## Sinopse

Once upon a time a thousand years back from now, there was a legendary man that trembled Japan, in the era of peace.

The man was Musashibou Benkei.
Spending his time as a priest soldier under control of Honen of Mount Hiei, he started to feel the emptiness of his own overwhelming power somewhere down the line.
One day, Honen descended the mountain with his armed priests including Benkei.
And Benkei happened to see......

Why he was born, how he should live.
Only heaven knows the meaning of his life.
It is an unprecedented saga of a man with passion for Japanese people.
