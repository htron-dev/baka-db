    "sinopse": "After Mintato Rika's transfer into the class, everything changed. But even though she was made into an object of persecution, the girl didn't lose herself and became acquainted with Izono. Having learned his secret, the mysterious individual compelled her classmate into living together and made an astonishing proposal: to get revenge on the two instigators. At first, Izono was reluctant, but then slowly starts to agree with Minato's methods. After befriending Haru, another victim of bullying, they start to raise a mutiny.\n\n(Source: Isohungry Translations)",
