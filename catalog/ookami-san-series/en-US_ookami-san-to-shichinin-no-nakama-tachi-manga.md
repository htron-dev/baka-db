## Sinopse

A long time ago... Wait... it's not really that long ago. There lived a certain Ookami-san... She's bad-mouthed, and not to mention flat-chested. Even so, she's still the heroine. She works for Otogi Ginkou, a group who does favors for others and demands something in return when necessary.

Well then, watch as Ookami-san and company unfold many weird... really weird stories. Behold, Ookami-san and her Seven Companions.
