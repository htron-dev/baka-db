## Sinopse

Sarah Hunter was a lady of the night. Not in the salacious sense, but Ethan Travis had no way of knowing her close-held secrets. He saw, instead of an avenging angel, a lost and vulnerable soul who needed his unique talents to rescue her — almost as much as he needed her unconditional love to rescue him!

Cloaked in a dark and dangerous appeal, Ethan Travis wore his whispered title of "the Demon of Alsatia" well. And Sarah Hunter was drawn to him with a mad intensity. But it was futile, she knew, for even a man with a past could never truly desire a woman without a future!
