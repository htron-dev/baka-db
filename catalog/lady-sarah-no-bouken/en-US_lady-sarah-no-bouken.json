    "sinopse": "Sarah Hunter was a lady of the night. Not in the salacious sense, but Ethan Travis had no way of knowing her close-held secrets. He saw, instead of an avenging angel, a lost and vulnerable soul who needed his unique talents to rescue her — almost as much as he needed her unconditional love to rescue him!\n\nCloaked in a dark and dangerous appeal, Ethan Travis wore his whispered title of \"the Demon of Alsatia\" well. And Sarah Hunter was drawn to him with a mad intensity. But it was futile, she knew, for even a man with a past could never truly desire a woman without a future!\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
