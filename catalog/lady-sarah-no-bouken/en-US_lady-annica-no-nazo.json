    "sinopse": "Annica, of royal descent, is an unusual woman by the standards of London society. Independent and liberated, she doesn't humble herself before any man. Tristan likes her the moment he sees her, and comes up with many excuses to approach her. But she is hard to pin down, and he's all wrapped up in her outrageous actions. Meanwhile, Annica feels attracted to Tristan since he seems to understand her, but right now she's more concerned with trying to help her friend Sarah, even if that means leaping into danger...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
