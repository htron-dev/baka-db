## Sinopse

Nao is a high-school student with a secret he carefully hides from everybody: He’s fallen in love with his close friend, Hira. One day, Hira tells Nao that he looks different lately. Now Nao is terrified that Hira might have noticed his feelings! Or could it be that he’s just over-reacting and his friend hasn’t noticed anything at all?
