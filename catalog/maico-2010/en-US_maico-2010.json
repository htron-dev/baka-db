    "sinopse": "Maico is Japan's newest radio DJ. When she's not working she must stave off assassins, crazed fans and a couple of office workers as well. She believes she was created just to be the perfect DJ. What she doesn't know is that she's really a sexdroid—a robot specifically designed for sex. However, her creator Otari Masudamasu wanted her to be as close to human as possible and not a sex toy. Maico's never had sex and is shy at times. She constantly learns about love and matters of the heart. She later meets another sexdroid Rei, Masudamasu’s first android, who is designed to be like her late sister. After saving her from her evil controllers, who only used her to try to destroy Maico and as a sex toy, she and Maico become crime fighting DJs called Cherry-Bombs.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
