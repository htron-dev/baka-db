## Sinopse

Sonekawa Retsu, the high school karate club captain, has been in love with the student body president, Kaji Shogo since junior high. He even went as far as volunteering as the student body secretary in order to be close to him.

Retsu has never thought of confessing his feelings but his constant heated stares don't leave Kaji unaware of his true feelings. However, this bashful late bloomer needs serious help…

Would love finally blossom between these two men from different worlds?
