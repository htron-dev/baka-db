## Sinopse

In spite of the words, "Congrats on passing your college examination." Retsu, the younger lover chooses to go to a different university and bitterly regrets his decision. "Have you been suffering a little bit over the lost time that we could've had together?" Kaji then is anxiety-stricken over Retsu, who's always ran ahead of him in his growth.

With the admirable and cool dog president of the student council, the naughty and sexy & cute older brother dog, the M type dog and with the S type honor student, this makes up the 3rd series about a fulfilling love life right happening right before graduation and after!!
