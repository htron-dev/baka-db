## Sinopse

This is the story of Hayamizu Akira, a rich girl with society connections, a planned out future, and she hates it. She wants nothing to do with the snobs in her mother's life.

One day when running away from one of her mother's "events" she accidentally falls in with a gambler on the run from a loan shark. They wind up at the local speedboat race, where he wins enough money to pay off his creditors.

But what Akira notices is that the winner of the exciting race is a woman, and she decides right there and then that this is what she wants to do.

Can she escape her mother's clutches and pursue her dreams to become a pro speedboat racer?
