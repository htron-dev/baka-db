    "sinopse": "An old person who had piled up good deeds in Japan reaches the end of his life, and is reincarnated into another world as Lean Olgott, the grandson of a certain king. One day, the boy, who was raised showered with love by his family, noticed that he had been bestowed the title \"The Child Loved by God.\" He disregarded it for a while, but gradually, the abnormality of his own abilities became evident. Magic power that far surpasses that of ordinary people, conversing with plants...the cause for all of these, as expected, was that title! One night, Lean Olgott, who wished for a peaceful daily life, was called out by a legendary sacred beast, and life completely changed!\n\n(Source: AlphaPolis, translated)",
