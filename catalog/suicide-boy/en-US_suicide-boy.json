    "sinopse": "Lee Hoon (a.k.a. Hooni) is a wimpy 17-year-old high school student experiencing rock bottom. Due to the high medical costs of his mother's hospital stay before her death, as well as the gambling debt accrued by his abusive father, Hooni is left with crippling debt that leaves him impoverished. This combined with the constant, severe bullying he faces at school has given him extremely low self-esteem. Due to the seemingly endless difficulties he faces, Hooni's only goal in life is to kill himself. This, however, proves more difficult than he thought as he cannot find a satisfactory, pain-free method of doing so. Perhaps he'll finally find a good way to end himself, or maybe life isn't as bad as it seems?",
