    "sinopse": "Miranda was once known as the queen of high society, but now she lives alone on a deserted island in the Caribbean. Or, she did until a man named Louis made a sudden intrusion into her island home. He knows all about Miranda's past, and comes across as exceedingly arrogant. Especially when he announces that her uncle has sold him the island and everything on it... including her! It was because of her uncle that Miranda had to abandon her former life... And now this? Yet when Louis abruptly steals a kiss from her, she feels an intense heat envelop her body...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
