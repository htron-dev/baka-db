    "sinopse": "Fujino Misato, the cute young florist and landlord, is being bullied by debt collectors. Enters Sakanoue, a silver accessories designer. Sakanoue intervenes in a dispute between a perverted debt collector and Fujino. Upon rescuing Fujino, Sakanoue gets fussed out by the seemingly ungrateful Fujino. A short time later, Sakanoue’s manager, Kaoruko gets an apartment for Sakanoue that is located in Fujino’s building.\n\nSakanoue disguises himself in front of Fujino and moves into Fujino’s apartment building. Fujino treated the disguised Sakanoue rather cordially but when Sakanoue’s true face is revealed Fujino’s personality does a 180. Thus start the quirky cat-dog relationship between Fujino and Sakanoue. Fujino’s prejudices and Sakanoue’s hidden identity causes great strains in both of their lives. Can these two stop their constant bickering long enough to establish a loving relationship?\n\n(Source: Baka-Updates)",
