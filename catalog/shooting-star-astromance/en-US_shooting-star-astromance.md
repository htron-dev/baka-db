## Sinopse

Lala has always believed ever since she was little that her prince would come from outer space, so she would always ask of God and the Moon that she could meet her extraterrestrial prince soon.
One night she meets a bishounen by the name of Ban and instantly falls for him but is he really an alien or just another human?
