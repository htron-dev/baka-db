## Sinopse

Elaine Lana Norris, a woman of noble birth, appears to be in crisis. Her fiancé has annulled their engagement, her childhood friend Evan has cast her aside, and her grandfather has banished her from the household. All of this is the doing of their country's two-faced "Saint" Sandra, who falsely accused Elaine of misdeeds.

Instead of sadness, however, what Elaine feels is elation! As it turns out, Elaine's previous life in Japan revolved around makeup and cosplay, and she retains these hobbies in her current one. Finally free from the chains of her aristocratic responsibilities, she assumes her commoner name of "Lana" and returns to her true calling as the owner of the warm and welcoming Fairy's Inn.
