## Sinopse

After his childhood friend, Tsuzuki Shouchirou, got a lover, wine cellar owner, Arisue Hibiki, couldn’t help feeling lonesome! And his sommelier, Sukezane Kensou, saw right through him.
Dared by Sukezane’s enigmatic look, Arisue invited Sukezane for a one-night stand. However, Arisue realized a little too late—... that his feelings were involved—…. Thus begins a new story created by the golden team of Ebihara Yuri and Fuyuno Jinko !!
