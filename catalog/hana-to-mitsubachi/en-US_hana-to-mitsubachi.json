    "sinopse": "\"Bishonen\" are the beautiful boys that overpopulate shôjo manga. Flowers & Bees is the manga that makes men out of beautiful boys. Beautiful men.\n\nMasao Komatsu might think of himself as a total loss. But high-school life is never so bad that it can't get a little worse, and unfortunately, it turned out he still has a few crumbs of self-respect hiding here and there.\nGorgeous sisters Kiyoko and Harumi will be happy to vacuum them out of his pockets--with each and every visit by Masao to World of Beautiful Men, the men's salon they own.\n\nWhy shouldn't young men, too, get the chance to have their lives ruined in the pursuit of unattainable standards of beauty? Though mocked by classmates and stared at on the street, Masao vows to remain faithful to his makeovers--determined to become the man hairdressers, estheticians, and fashion magazine editors only dream that women dream of!\n\n(Source: Viz)",
