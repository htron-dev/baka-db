## Sinopse

Cruz reincarnated in the lower demons of the demon world. Cruz, who was aiming for a first-class pastry chef in her previous life, is just confused by the world where there is only black food.

Still, she touched the kindness of the demons around her—"I want to make the demon world happy with sweets!" Deciding so, she completed the first "parfait" in the demon world with limited materials. The demons are instantly captivated by the sweets they eat for the first time! Furthermore, she was called by the strongest Demon Lord in history who heard the rumor...!?
