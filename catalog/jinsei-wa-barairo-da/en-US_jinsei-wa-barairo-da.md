## Sinopse

On his 19th birthday Yayoi's parents were killed in an accident. Once his girlfriend tells him of how rich he will become he's no longer very sad about their death. When the time comes to learn of his fortune it quickly turns into misfortune since he is left with his parent's 100 million yen debt! Once his girlfriend finds out about his new debt she dumps him, but not before telling him of a host job! While he has the looks, does he have the guts to do it?
