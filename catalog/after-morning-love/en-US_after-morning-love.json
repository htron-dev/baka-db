    "sinopse": "Matsuno, a straight-laced lawyer, wakes up to a male prostitute, Rin, in his bed after a night of heavy drinking! Rin is like a stray cat with no place to go, working in the city's night life to pick up clients and make a living. A few days later Matsuno finds Rin looking for another client, and on the spur of the moment, goes up to him and tells him \"I'm not gay so I won't have with you but I can offer you a bed and food\". A sweet and bitter love story filled with misunderstandings.\n\n(Source: Dangerous Pleasure)",
