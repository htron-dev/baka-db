## Sinopse

"For my love, the price to pay is your blood."

In order to punish her loathsome ex-boyfriend, Hisoka attempts to use black magic on him. However, she makes a mistake in casting a spell, and accidentally calls a vampire named Rein instead!! He said that he will grant one wish for Hisoka but in return she must present him with her blood. At first, Hisoka is afraid but even though Rein is a vampire, he slowly changes into a gentle person, and because of that, her attraction towards him grows?! (Source: Midnight Scans)
