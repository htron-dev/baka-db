    "sinopse": "Ayumu Shiina is always the center of attention of any group he's in, and is apparently very happy with the state of his life. Although it is widely known that he is gay, his good looks and friendly attitude make him popular with peers of any gender. However, he does not show just how much effort it takes to keep a smile on his own face as well as those of everyone around him.\n\nShiina may enter romantic relationships easily, but his poor taste in men leads him to be rejected over and over again—usually in favor of a woman, rather than another man. In their freshman year of high school, classmate Souta Hayase witnessed the \"scenes of carnage\" that were Shiina's early break-ups; consequently, he became the only person to see Shiina's teary, unguarded face after having his heart broken.\n\nShiina and Hayase never saw each other again after moving into different classes, but now they are reunited at the same university. Hayase is concerned that Shiina might continue to find himself in situations where he cries his heart out, but for his part, Shiina intends to prove that he is not a crybaby anymore.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncludes the two-part one-shot Ore no Hou ga Zettai Kawaii! (I'm Definitely Cute!).",
