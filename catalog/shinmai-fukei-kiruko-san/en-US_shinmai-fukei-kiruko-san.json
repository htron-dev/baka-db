    "sinopse": "After eagerly waiting for the arrival of his new subordinate, policeman Haruki Anjou finds out the recruit, Kiruko Otonashi, is a tonfa-wielding ex-mercenary who doesn't believe in moderation! Whether it is chasing down a thief or doing daily patrols, Kiruko is sure to complete the task using the full force of her military training and ridiculous strength, much to Anjou's chagrin.\n\nEven though Anjou can barely contain the new recruit, his life gets much more difficult when Kiruko's old squadmate, the behemoth Bullet Hawk, and special investigator Chiaki Uchigane come to town as well. With the four's combined talent of greatly exaggerating even the simplest of duties, the city of Nagashima can rest assured that its police force is enthusiastic, to say the least!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
