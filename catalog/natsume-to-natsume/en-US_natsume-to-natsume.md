## Sinopse

"I want to be her hero."

Shiranui Natsume, a 2nd year high school student, admires his childhood friend, Minazuki Natsume, who is always coming to help him whenever he's in trouble and showing him the way. He strives to one day be like her: cool, composed, and, most importantly, hero-like.

Until he becomes her hero, this is the story of Natsume and Natsume.
