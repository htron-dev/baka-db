## Sinopse

In the late 1990s, with society descending into totalitarianism and anarchy, comes Saiga Riki-Oh, a lone wolf devoted to rooting out people's evil karma. To reconnect with a long-lost brother and solve the mystery behind the separated family and its relation to the Star of David on his hand, he punches through gangsters, corrupt martial artists, and more, all while drawing an equal number of hotblooded supporters and insane enemies.
