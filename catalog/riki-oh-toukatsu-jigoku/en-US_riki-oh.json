To reconnect with a long-lost brother and solve the mystery behind the separated family and its relation to the Star of David on his hand, he punches through gangsters, corrupt martial artists, and more, all while drawing an equal number of hotblooded supporters and insane enemies.\n\n(Source: unami)",
