## Sinopse

"...Fueh? W-What is it?"

When the shut-in girl Terakomari, or Komari for short, woke up from her slumber, she had been appointed as a commander! And if that wasn't enough, the corps she holds responsibility over is known for overthrowing and murdering their superiors! Even though she had been born into a prestigious vampire family, because she can't drink any blood, she possesses close to no athletic or physical abilities, she's rather small for her age, and she can't even use any magic.

Met with endless despair, her trusted (?) maid Vill comes to the rescue. "Please leave it to me, Komari-sama. I will definitely make sure you won't be found out!"

Thus begins the comical fantasy portraying Komari's struggles. She's a shut-in, but she can actually do it if she puts her mind to it?!
