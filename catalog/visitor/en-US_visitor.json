    "sinopse": "Beautiful Hyo-Bin Na is the new girl at school who everybody wants to meet. But Hyo-Bin is no normal high school student and she certainly has no desire to be popular. You see, she's cursed with supernatural abilities and by a dark and dangerous past. Everyone she has ever gotten close has ended up dead. Hyo-Bin doesn't want to go through the pain of lost friends and lost love again, so she vows to not get too close to anyone or to date anybody at her new school.\n\nBut, alas, and of course, it isn't quite that easy...\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
