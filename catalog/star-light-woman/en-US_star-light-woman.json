    "sinopse": "An alien species wanted to start a revolution against their oppressors, and they think they may have found the power in humanity to accomplish their goals. They discovered that humans have latent superpowers, and so they began to abduct them and awaken their abilities. Unfortunately, the humans' abilities were not very useful for their purposes---at least not until they found the destructive power of #214.",
