    "sinopse": "Folklore detective Asou Daisuke would rather deal with normal, everyday, things like cheating spouses, embezzling partners and the like. Because whenever he deals with the supernatural, he gets the hiccups.\n\nBut no matter, an endless stream of desperate people come to him troubled by what he calls allegories. Those are stories, usually urban legends, that one believes to be true and if one believes strong enough can cause them to become true. His first case involves \"The Man Under The Bed.\" Can he stop this creepy man with an axe before he chops up Hiranuma Kanae? Why does Asou count his hiccups and just who is that strange girl in his bathroom?\n\n(Source: MU)",
