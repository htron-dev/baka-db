    "sinopse": "When it comes to workplace romance, any guy will tell you that it's best to keep your eyes on the clock…and your hands to yourself! But what if your gorgeous crush makes it clear that she'd love a little after-hours attention? Can lust, longing and brand-new thrills ever add up to a lasting relationship?\n\nStardust Traffic crackles with the body heat of flirtatious first-timers and rebellious romantics! Should a handsome trainer trust an adorable client with out-of-control affections? And will a newly engaged couple find an exciting way to chase those pre-wedding blues away?\n\n(Source: Project-H)",
