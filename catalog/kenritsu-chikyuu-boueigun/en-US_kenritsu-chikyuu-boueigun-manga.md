## Sinopse

The evil secret society known as the Telephone Pole Gang seeks to take over the world by first taking over a certain prefecture on Kyuushuu (they never specify which one). In order to thwart the evil plans of the Telephone Pole Gang, Imazuru High School creates the Prefectural Earth Defense Force, composed of problem teachers and students from the school. They are also joined by a cyborg transfer student from India.

The Telephone Pole Gang is commanded by Chilthonian. Her staff includes Colonel Baradaki as well as Ryūko Harataki, who has taken on the role of a student at Imazuru High School.
