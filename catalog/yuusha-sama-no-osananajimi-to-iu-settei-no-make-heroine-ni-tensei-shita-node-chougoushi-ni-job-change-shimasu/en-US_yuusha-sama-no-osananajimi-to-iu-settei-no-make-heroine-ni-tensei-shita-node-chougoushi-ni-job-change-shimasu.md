## Sinopse

Laura, the childhood friend, has been completely forgotten! In the world of a game, Laura has been reincarnated as "the losing heroine who is forgotten, despite confessing." Instead, she'll aim to be an alchemist to escape that fate...

However, when Laura meets Arnold, a person who should not be there, she realizes there are many differences between this world and that of her memories. This difference could even affect the future of her childhood friend, the hero!

She will never be chained down by fate! A different world reincarnation story of a girl who never gives up!
