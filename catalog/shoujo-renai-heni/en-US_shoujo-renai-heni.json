    "sinopse": "\"A world in which everyone is born female and some become male upon maturity (a bit like in \"Simoun\"). Momoka and Arisu are very close friends, and Momoka wants to become a man and marry Arisu . . . only when they end up in danger from a rapist, it is Arisu who suddenly turns male! Arisu's transformation seems to be unstable though, as \"he\" returns to female again when the adrenaline rush fails.\"\n\n(Source: MU)",
