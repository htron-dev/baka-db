    "sinopse": "The hero Kaito Ukei died. Blood seeped from his wounds, his body went limp, and the ones who he once called friends gloated over his death. Betrayed, Kaito was consumed by one thought: revenge. With this will, a system message announced that the Holy Sword of Vengeance activated, and time began to rewind—all the way to when he was first summoned to this other world.\n\nThis time, Kaito won't be a fool. He won't fall for their lies and platitudes. He will return every inch of pain they inflicted on him and carve it deep in their hearts so they never forget his name. They will regret using him; after all, he will not give them the satisfaction of a quick death. Even if they plead, beg, or cry, Kaito will only laugh. There is no respite from his beautiful and bloody path of revenge.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
