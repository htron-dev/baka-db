## Sinopse

Little Rui having lost her mother is sent by her father to be taken care of by a girl named Honoko, who looks almost identical to her own mother. But it's not just her face that has grabbed Rui's attraction to Honoko....it's also the passion for soccer!

Promising to become pro and play alongside her adopted sister Honoko, 13yr old blue-eyed Rui would let nothing stop her!
