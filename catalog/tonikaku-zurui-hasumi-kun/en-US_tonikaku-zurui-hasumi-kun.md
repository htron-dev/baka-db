## Sinopse

Hibiya Riika likes the idea of falling in love since she doesn't experienced it yet, so she at first decides to support her friend, but in the end, it ends up quite badly.

With her idea of "fated love" somewhat shattered, now with Harumi by her side, a classmate known as a little bit allergic to girls, she starts to feel something new... Is this what she is looking for? or not?
