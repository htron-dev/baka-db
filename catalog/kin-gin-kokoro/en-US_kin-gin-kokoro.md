## Sinopse

Each birthstone holds a different significance. Silver birthstones represent bad luck and are shunned by all, while gold birthstones are the exact opposite. Saffron is the holder of a gold birthstone, while Kai is the holder of a silver one. How will these two cousins get through such a twisted fate in such a traditional society?
