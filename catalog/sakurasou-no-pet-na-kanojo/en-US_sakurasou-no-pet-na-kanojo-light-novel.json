    "sinopse": "Sorata Kanda, an amicable student enrolled at Suimei High School, is evicted out of the student dorms for adopting a stray cat. Having his kindness backfire on him, he ends up at the notorious \"Sakura Hall,\" where he meets its residents—a cast of eccentric, artistic prodigies. Stuck with an increasing number of stray cats in addition to being average amongst geniuses, Sorata is determined to find new owners for these cats and leave Sakura Hall for good.\n\nShortly after moving in, his life is further thrown into disarray as he is tasked with taking care of Mashiro Shiina, a new transfer student and aspiring manga author. Despite being a world-renowned artist, she lacks common sense and is utterly incapable of looking out for herself. With the support of their fellow Sakura Hall residents, Sorata and Mashiro grow ever closer as they weave through the webs of expectations and determine their self-worth, striving to discover their true calling in life.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
