## Sinopse

Itto Ippongi, like his name suggests, doesn't know how to give up even when he's doing things wrong. He's not good at much, but he can deliver your ramen takeout in record speed on his bicycle. Once Miyata, a classmate who participates in bicycle races, sees Ippongi on his bicycle, he knows right away that he wants Ippongi on his team, Cycle On.
