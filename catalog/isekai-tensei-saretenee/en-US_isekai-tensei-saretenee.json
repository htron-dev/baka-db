As thanks, he lets Kousuke reincarnate into another world. He was overjoyed to live the life of those overpowered protagonists seen in his favorite isekai stories. However, when he came to, he found himself at the very same spot he died. This is the story of a protagonist living a peaceful life in the modern era with the cheat ability given to him by a god... not.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
