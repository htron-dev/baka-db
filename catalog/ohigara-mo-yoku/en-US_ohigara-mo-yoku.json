    "sinopse": "From the time he was very young, Shuuta longed to be \"married\" through adoption to Kouhei. While Kouhei as a guardian was too absentminded, Shuuta always felt as if he never fulfilled his duties as a \"wife.\" It's a love story between an airheaded, thick-skinned, handsome \"husband\" and an innocent, pure-hearted new \"wife\" with an age gap!\n\n(Source: Shinshokan, translated)",
