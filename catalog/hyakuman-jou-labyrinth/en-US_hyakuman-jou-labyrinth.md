## Sinopse

What if real life could "glitch"?

Reika and Youko, two students, wander in a huge building, a real never-ending labyrinth defying imagination. Their only clue: a mysterious message on a table, signed by Tagami, a famous video game creator, who seems to know more about this place.

What is the real nature of this place? Why are Reika and Youko humanity's only hope?
