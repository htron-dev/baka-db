## Sinopse

Izumi is a boy who has problems communicating with others and subsequently, he has not held a conversation with anyone for years. Shinohara is a gal-style girl who sits in the front of him, and he admires the way she can quickly write on her smartphone. One day, he speaks to her while casually helping her stretch her hand and she responds by saying he has a nice voice and should start interacting with people again. But he might need the help of both Shinohara and her friends if he is ever going to learn how to properly socialize with other people.
