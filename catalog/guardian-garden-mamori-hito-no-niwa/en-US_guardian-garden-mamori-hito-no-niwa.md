## Sinopse

Incoming high-school girl Kisaragi Hinata works at the flower shop her father owns with her best friends. Her mom died while she was still a baby and her dad disappeared 10 years ago, leaving her without a family. She is usually very happy, but still can’t shake off the trauma of losing a family. One day, she gets kidnapped by an organization that seems to know some secret about Hinata. Lucky for her, two beautiful people that have extraordinary abilities and some kind of connection with her dad save her. She then discovers that she can communicate with plants. Could this be why people are after her?
