## Sinopse

Don't be fooled by appearances. Oninbo may be the cutest demon around, but his table manners can be downright revolting. That's because his favorite snacks are grotesque Bugs from Hell. These creatures live in the hearts of people, where they grow fat and hideous until they are ready to devour the very souls that nourish them. Oninbo can smell a bug a mile away, and will risk anything to get his hands on a ripe, juicy specimen. But he's not the only one with a bug appetite. Mamushinbo, his demon rival, is also after the Bugs from Hell.
