    "sinopse": "Olivia should have died that day, wrapped in a cloth at the Gate to the Underworld. But by the death god Zed's whim, she survived and was raised by him until she came of age. Then, one day, he disappeared, leaving behind only three things: a brilliant red jewel, a letter, and an ominous black sword. Carrying these with her, Olivia left to join the war.\n\nOn the continent, a bloody war between the Kingdom and Imperial armies has ensued for years. For two years, neither country could gain a strong enough foothold to secure victory, and the bodies continued to pile up. But the Kingdom is now on its last legs, backed into a corner with only a single main line of defense remaining.\n\nHowever, their ray of hope comes in the form of Olivia, whose innocent appearance can barely contain the killer inside. The blood-soaked girl raised by death will change the tides of war, leaving a trail of beheaded bodies, dismembered limbs, and rotting corpses in her wake.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
