## Sinopse

In this world, Nami has the power of using magic, but with her clumsy nature she has no mean of controlling it, although it's secondary to the way of controlling her feelings. When she meets Ryotaro Tominaga by crashing his bike, she becomes more and more anxious to understand her first love, while Ryotaro is despising her. Nami has a kind heart and soul, but she lacks courage and spirit to make crucial decisions especially in the last year of high-school. Here Nami and her friends reside in the world of magic, mixed feelings, misunderstanding, unrequited love, hate and passion to realize where they all belong.
