    "sinopse": "Second year high school student Rakurou Hizutome is interested in one thing only: finding \"shitty games\" and beating the crap out of them. His gaming skills are second to none, and no game is too bad for him to enjoy. So when he's introduced to the new VR game Shangri-La Frontier, he does what he does best—min-maxes and skips the prologue to jump straight into the action. But can even an expert gamer like Rakurou discover all the secrets that Shangri-La Frontier hides...?\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",
