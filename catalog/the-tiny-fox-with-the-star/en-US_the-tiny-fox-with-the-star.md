## Sinopse

A clumsy, nine-tailed fox born with only one tail and labled as a discrace. Made to serve his brother that calls him stupid and an idiot. One day, a mysterious creature arrives and tell this fox about a lowly human that learned to smile even in the darkest of times. The one-tailed fox now tries everything to be like that human.
