## Sinopse

A dangerous exchange with a gorgeous billionaire.

Ever since one of Australia's most successful entrepreneurs stole her company, Marina's life has been nothing but chaos. After her parents passed away, Marina had no choice but to settle the problem on her own. She crashes a party to try to negotiate with the billionaire, but she offends the prideful man and finds herself surrounded by Wakefield's bodyguards. Suddenly a mysterious man named Ronan Carlisle comes to her aid and offers to help get her company back...under one condition. Marina must pretend to be his mistress!
