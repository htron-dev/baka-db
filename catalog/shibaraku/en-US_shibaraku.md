## Sinopse

Imperial Year 2952. Peace is but a distant memory, and the flames of anger and impatience consume the inhabitants of planet Earth. To put a stop to frequent riots, a task force is created, the "White Lions". Isao is part of that group, but due of his lack of discipline, is constantly reprimanded by his superiors ... That behind his strange habits is hiding something more than simple insubordination?
