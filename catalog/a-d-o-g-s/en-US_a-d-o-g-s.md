## Sinopse

In the beginning of the 21st century, the occurrence and severity of underage crimes were increasing exponentially. Ranging from assault, robbery, rape to murder, and spiraling out of control, the adults made drastic changes to the law regarding underage criminals, but no one could change their underlying dangerous nature. The A-Dogs were created to fight back and hunt down the dangerous teenagers who threatened to bring society into chaos. Lead by Captain Inukai, Tetsuro and Jackal are A-Dogsâ€™ elite warriors who have been trained to eliminate the danger to society.
