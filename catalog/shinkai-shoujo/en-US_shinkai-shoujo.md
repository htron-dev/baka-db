A year ago, Hikari Tanaka, who went missing in the sea, was rescued from the bottom of the sea by the Deep-Sea King, and came back as a deep-sea girl with the power of deep-sea creatures! Hikari's childhood friend Yamada is happy that she's back, but is puzzled by Hikari's strange behaviors like lighting up and turning transparent.
