Legend has it that the remote island had long ago been the hideout of a group of extremely cruel bandits, and that priceless treasures - the fruits of their plunders - are still hidden somewhere on the island.\n\nAll is well until their club adviser and two members are brutally murdered. Thereby the curtain rises on the surviving girls' life-threatening battle with a bizarre masked killer...\n\n(Source: Village Idiot)",
