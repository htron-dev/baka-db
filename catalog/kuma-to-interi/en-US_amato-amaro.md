## Sinopse

From Basso, more stories of Italians, powerful men, and homosexual love...maybe even at the same time.

Economist Vittorio Conti wants to see what having sex with a man is like, and does what any reasonable person would do in his situation: ask his bodyguard if he wants to give it a try. Straightlaced Armando Pagani refuses at first, but for how much longer?
