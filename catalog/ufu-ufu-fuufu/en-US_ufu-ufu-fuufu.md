## Sinopse

They are naive after getting married and naive after having a baby. The husband, "Hei-chan," is just as naive as his wife, "Chika-chan." Their newborn son Yuu-kun is adorable and they get along very well as a married couple... but as a man and woman they're hitting a rough patch?! It's a red-faced romantic comedy featuring a husband and wife seeking to become "intimate" again while raising an infant.
