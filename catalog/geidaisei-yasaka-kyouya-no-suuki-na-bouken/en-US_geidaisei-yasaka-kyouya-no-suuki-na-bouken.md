## Sinopse

Yasaka Kyouya just recently moved from Tokyo to Kyoto when he became a freshman in one of the fine arts colleges in Kyoto city, though college was only one of the reasons why he moved to Kyoto. His main objective was to get rid of his innate ability to see spirits and ghosts. He hoped that, by living in the city of the old gods and temples, he could find a cure to his annoying ability. While working at his part time job, he literally runs into a girl who mistakes him as her long-lost older brother. Running into this girl is the start of a supernatural journey that Kyouya never really wanted.
