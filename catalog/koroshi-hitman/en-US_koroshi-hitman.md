## Sinopse

Continental underworld (black market?) organizations are looking to expand into Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's "New Flying Tiger" are there to shut them down.

The mainland side has even resorted to hiring a handsome, go-getter hitman to do their work for them... but the Flying Tiger's Yoon is aware of their hitman, and something in their childhood links them.

Conflict between the sides intensifies, but while they hold each other at gunpoint several times, the two absolutely cannot shoot each other!?
