## Sinopse

Set in a world where every object has its own spirit, the story follows Miles, a young woman who has the rare ability to communicate with those spirits. Working as a spirit medium, Miles helps people find the objects that are compatible to them. Assisting her is a mysterious man named Gikaku who's literally not from this world. Dubbed as the "god of destruction" Gikaku wields a terrible power which, as it seems, only Miles can contain. But for how long?
