## Sinopse

Rebellious 23rd-century girl Neo has big dreams of being a singing star, but her unusual fashion sense and personality keep her from making it big. When she finds herself transported to the 21st century, she finally gets her chance from a producer to sing with the guff Saya. If they put on a wonderful concert, they'll be the next big stars... but if they mess it up, they'll be nobodies forever!
