## Sinopse

Manga written by Nemu Youko after she'd given birth to her daughter in 2018, published eight months later. It reflects on her own experience of pregnancy through lives of fictional couple Kiri and Muchan, two people in their 30's with already established routines, careers, and comfortable everyday dynamic, who after years of half-hearted discussions and tiptoeing around the subject find themselves expecting a child.
