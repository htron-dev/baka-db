## Sinopse

To please his crush, Yuu Kunishige, an ordinary middle schooler, stole his brother's invitation to a photography exhibition. However, he never would have thought he'd encounter an intimidating long-haired guy at the very place, who seemed to be his brother’s acquaintance... or even more than that, his brother’s ex-boyfriend...?
