Ashamed of failing her high school entrance exam, a 16-year-old tomboy Sooha just wants to disappear off the face of the Earth.

However, when she yells it out loud a mysterious stranger named Ganesha approaches with an offer. He comes from a magical realm called the Para Kingdom ruled by a female military hierarchy that enslaves the male population. Ganesha offers to grant Sooha's wish if she will help liberate the men.
