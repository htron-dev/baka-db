## Sinopse

This boy looks so cool, so it can't be helped if I fall in love. "We've been so close ever since middle school, so now, I can't tell him I like him..." is what Akemiya feels with an unrequited love towards Iwata. But upon entering high school and becoming friends with the two popular hotties, Fujiwara and Shirotaki, Iwata is starting to get cocky!! Iwata and Akemiya, the super popular side characters of Fujiwara-kun wa Daitai Tadashii present the long-awaited super popular spinoff series that will make your chest squeeze, give you warm fuzzies, make you laugh and make you cry♪.
