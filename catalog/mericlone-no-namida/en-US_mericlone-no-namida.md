## Sinopse

What circumstances might drive someone to create a clone that copies even their memories? A replacement so perfect that even the clone won't realize he's a clone? Nanako once took Louie up on his offer and had him create the perfect replica of herself; now she stays at his side, witness to the mericlones that he creates. Beyond the stories of the individuals he "saves," who exactly is this man playing god, and why does he do it?
