## Sinopse

Kinosato Keiichi is your average loafer, who after losing both his job AND place he lived in, with a stroke of luck discovers a part-time job that would provide a place to live in as well!

Said job, is to gather data for two weeks by looking after and educating the two humanoid robot [DOLL]s, Ruby and Sapphire.

Of course, there is a lot more going on behind the scenes than Keiichi thinks, be it the complicated soap opera relationships going on between his colleagues OR the possible disposal of the DOLL deemed to have ‘inferior data’ when the time limit is up…
