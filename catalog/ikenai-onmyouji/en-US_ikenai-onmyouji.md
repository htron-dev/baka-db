## Sinopse

Harutaka is the heir to the Mikadomori house and is currently training in the Onmyoudou arts. But Harutaka has a big problem—his body readily attracts strong, evil spirits that he can't handle. So he lives with the kind and obedient Mutsuki, an onmyouji who supports and protects Harutaka as a member of the Mikadomori house. But is the affable Mutsuki hiding a dark personality?
