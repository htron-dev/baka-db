Akio's daily life has been taken care of by his best friend, Ryousuke. Akio has been secretly in love with this best friend for so long. Ryousuke is a serious salaried man and always hopes to have a family. However, Ryousuke's wife-to-be ran away before the wedding. Since then, Ryousuke began to pamper Akio even more.
