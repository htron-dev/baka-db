## Sinopse

All that traveling monk Benkei wants from the Shanaou of Kurama Temple is to defeat him and take the Sword of Bishamonten as his thousandth sword. But instead of losing the boy, he gains a new master—Minamoto no Kurou Yoshitsune, a man destined to be one of the greatest warriors in the Jishou era.
