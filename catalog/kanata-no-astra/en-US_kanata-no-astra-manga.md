## Sinopse

In the year 2061, mankind's domain stretches across the vast expanse of the universe. Eight students from Caird High School, along with a young child, embark for an exciting interstellar camp on the planet MCPA, which is located nine light-years from their home. Among them are the brave and athletic Kanata Hoshijima and the cute and bubbly Aries Spring.

However, once the students arrive at MCPA, a strange ball of light starts chasing them. This mysterious sphere engulfs the students and sends them to a harrowing fate: a remote area of space located 5,012 light-years from safety. Hopelessly lost and quickly running out of resources, the students' only chance of returning home proves to be aboard a nearby abandoned spaceship, where their desperate fight for survival begins and the dark truths surrounding their deadly excursion are slowly revealed.
