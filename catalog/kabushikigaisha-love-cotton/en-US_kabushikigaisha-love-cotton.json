But when they go on a trip to Kenya, Naru doesn't want to accompany them, so she stays with her little brother in Japan. But renting a place is too expensive and she barely has any money to start with. By luck, Naru finds a job at a boutique that belonged to her grandmother, Venus.\n\n(Source: MU)",
