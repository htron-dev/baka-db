    "sinopse": "Souta's friend, Taketora, is chronically bad at managing his finances. Ever since the two met in college, Taketora has never ceased to borrow money from Souta. Money that he never gives back, or course. And it's not like Souta is rich or anything either, he can barely get by with the money he makes at his student job. But whenever Taketora makes that face, Souta is unable to resist... Worse yet, now Taketora is saying that rather than returning the money, he'll repay Souta... with his body?!!\n\n(Souce: 801 Media)",
