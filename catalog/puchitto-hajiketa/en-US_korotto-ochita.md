## Sinopse

Ever since Kazunari, the bar manager, put Ui under his protection, their relationship has been full of love and hugs. Even so, Kazunari's love philosophy is 'complicated', so he constantly denies his feelings. Despite all this, Ui does not give up. Can this relationship become something more?
