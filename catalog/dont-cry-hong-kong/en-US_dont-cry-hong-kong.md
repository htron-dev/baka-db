## Sinopse

At first it was only painful, but they just wanted to stay close.
There were those who yearned to close down the criminal underworld and black market that Yungoo so admired, and the boy Hung Kai (Takeshi Akira?) was a member of that organisation.

A noir romance about the lives of those men drawn into that town in Hong Kong refraining from Chinese restoration, where "Let's get stronger" is the only way to face old wounds.
