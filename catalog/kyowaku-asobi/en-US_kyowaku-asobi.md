## Sinopse

Takeshita, a new teacher, finds the erotic appeal of Wakamatsu, one of his students, very uncomfortable. He learns from his co-workers that Wakamatsu lives at a brothel and is advised to simply ignore him. But straight-laced Takeshita tries to reach out to him in sympathy, provoking interest from Wakamatsu as well. But what could Wakamatsu mean by "I'm better than the girls around here"? A blood-curdling ero-suspense story!
