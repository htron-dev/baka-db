## Sinopse

Sheriff Elmore Evans is a stoic gunslinger delivering frontier justice in the American Wild West. There is another side to him, though. Despite his notorious marksmanship, he is a hopeless romantic with no relationship experience!

He is also a chronic overthinker, relying on the cliched and often impractical advice of his father, caring more about impressing women than actually catching criminals. But usually, he ends up boosting his reputation as a gunslinger and falling flat with the ladies.

Evans is joined by his loyal but naive deputy Ted Hall and bounty hunter, love interest Phoebe Oakley who similarly lacks any relationship experience and tends to overthink things. Together they thwart hijinks and capture infamous criminals, always involving hilarious misunderstandings.
