## Sinopse

Cassidy is nine months pregnant. Donovan, the vice-president of a massive corporation, can't stand children. He broke their relationship off before she had the opportunity to reveal she was pregnant with his baby. But now he's appeared out of the blue to visit her. Donovan sees how pregnant Cassidy is and is shocked... He then goes on to proclaim that he will marry her and become the child's father! The truth is, Cassidy is still deeply in love with him, and his sincere words open her heart. While still puzzled about Donovan's change of heart, she accepts his proposal... If only she had realized that, for him, it was only a marriage of convenience to help him land the CEO position!
