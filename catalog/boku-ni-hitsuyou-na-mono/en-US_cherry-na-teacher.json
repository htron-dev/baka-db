    "sinopse": "Kotani found his pace all messed up when the new biology teacher, Fujishima Masato, appeared. Fujishima confessed and Kotani felt scared. Fujishima’s preservation won and Kotani accepted him. Kotani’s ex-student came back and behaved oddly towards Kotani. When Fujishima couldn’t find both of them, he thought Kotani might have been kidnapped. Was he able to save Kotani in time?\n\n(Source: Attractive Fascinante)",
