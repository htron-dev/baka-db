## Sinopse

Kotani found his pace all messed up when the new biology teacher, Fujishima Masato, appeared. Fujishima confessed and Kotani felt scared. Fujishima’s preservation won and Kotani accepted him. Kotani’s ex-student came back and behaved oddly towards Kotani. When Fujishima couldn’t find both of them, he thought Kotani might have been kidnapped. Was he able to save Kotani in time?
