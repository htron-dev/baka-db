## Sinopse

Dragged away on horseback by bandits, young villager Oname watches helplessly as her brother—while running after her—is mercilessly slain. Despite the kidnapping being successful, one stray bandit discovers that two men saw the whole ordeal and immediately charges to silence them. However, the witnesses Kirisuke and Johnny are wandering ronin, and they effortlessly butcher the bandit in retaliation. When the powerless villagers finally catch up, they plead the samurai to rescue Oname. For the simple reward of food and alcohol, the pair agree and set off towards the bandit camp, where a visceral and merciless bloodbath is soon to unfold.
