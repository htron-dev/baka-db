## Sinopse

At the popular Japanese-style tea house Rokuhoudou, customers can count on receiving not only excellent food and drink, but—if they wish for it—a helping hand in solving any problem that may be plaguing them. Serving in Rokuhoudou are four men who are consummate professionals in their individual fields: tea expert Sui, latte artist Gure, pâtissier Tsubaki and chef Tokitaka.
