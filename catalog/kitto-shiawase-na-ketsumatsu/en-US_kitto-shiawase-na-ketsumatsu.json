Sumire, a bartender who attracts only good-for-nothing men, has given up on happiness. Estranged from his parents, he should have gotten used to being alone... But a distant relative who's a university student, Yuushin, comes to spend some time with him, and Yuushin's feelings for Sumire grow stronger and stronger...\n\nA heartrending age-gap romance.\n\n(Source: Kaiousha, translated)",
