## Sinopse

Sin is about three Ghosthunters:
Namgung Seog-Jin, a well-build catholic priest, Seodunami, who was born with the strength from darkness and who was taught occult arts by his mother and the last: Gumiho, an originally hunted ghost, who changed sides after meeting Seodunami. Their mission is to redeem ghosts so that they can leave either to hell or heaven.

The art and story is from Hwan Kim, who might be known for his illustration of King of Hell and Hero.
