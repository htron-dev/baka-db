## Sinopse

The first person that Shouko has gone out with is the first person that she has confessed to. His name is Asakawa. The only problem is, the girlfriend he treasured so much just dumped him two months ago. If he really does love Shouko, then he would call her by her name as she wants him to. So why won't he though?
