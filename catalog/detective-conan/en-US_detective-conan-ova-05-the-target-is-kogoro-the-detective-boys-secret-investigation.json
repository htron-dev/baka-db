After discarding other possible topics, the Detective Boys concludes that it's a perfect opportunity to find out more about Detective Kogorou Mouri's job.\n\nConan's friends refuse to settle for a simple interview though, as they want to experience first-hand all the details of his work. Thus, they, along with a reluctant Conan and Ai Haibara, decide to tail the renowned detective for a day. However, the kids soon get involved in a grim situation when Kogorou's current case takes an unexpected and dangerous turn.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
