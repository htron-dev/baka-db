    "sinopse": "Will the young teacher Yuuri ever know what it feels like to be in love? After all, he's the unlucky inheritor of a pheromone that makes him 100% irresistible to every man (and woman) who crosses his path! It's too bad that the stubborn and handsome student Hasegawa seems totally unfazed by Yuuri's frustrating situation. In fact, Hasegawa is convinced that the two men will someday marry! It's up to Yuuri to figure out whether the boy's heart is in the right place. Has the lovestruck Hasegawa simply fallen prey to the passion-inducing power of a family curse?\n\nBiyaku na Honey is a spellbinding mix of crazy comedy, gorgeous couples and sneaky flirtations! Can the star of the varsity baseball team actually score the hottest instructor in school? And what happens when a cool and smart \"big brother\" finally breaks the rules and comes to terms with his deepest desires? Each of these sweet stories is a perfect dose of the most unforgettable concoction you'll ever taste!",
