## Sinopse

Moriya is in charge of finding a model for a new product commerical for a big jewelry brand; but, nobody matches the ideal of perfection he has in mind... That is, until he meets Itsuki Ouno. Itsuki is not just perfection incarnate, he's like royalty, and incredibly spoiled. And he may well be the one person destiny put in Moriya's way to fulfill his need to adore and serve. (Source: MU)
