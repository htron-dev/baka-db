## Sinopse

The fluffy and strongest Holy Beast! One day Seraphione, a nobleman's daughter, met Roux and recalled her previous life's memories of a Japanese woman in her thirties. "I've been reborn in another world, and not only that but I'm a villain!?" If they find out about her cheat magic then it means the destruction end!

However, although she knows that, she still loves magic and carelessly enters into a magical contract with Roux. If it continues like this it'll become dangerous! In that case let's train and aim to become an adventurer!
