    "sinopse": "There was a fire. Kousei lost his mother, his father and his precious little sister, Sanae. One month later he woke up to find himself in a hospital and was moved to pediatrics where he could share a room with other boys his age.\n\nProfessor Kimishiro is loved and respected by his students, but disliked by faculty and administration. He's pushed from his classroom by university politics and takes a team to the jungles of the Amazon in search of new medicines and perhaps a chance to gain back his reputation amongst those with influence back home. Instead of cures, his team stumbles upon a lost temple in the jungle, a place the village guides claim to be 'The House of the God of the Black Death'. What are the temple's secrets, and can any man, let alone a mere boy, survive the plague of an angry God?\n\n(Source: SnoopyCool)",
