It's at this time that Fengtai's beautiful ex-girlfriend, Zhouhe, transfers to their school, and Penghua becomes unable to tell Fengtai how she feels. However, not everything Penghua assumes about Zhouhe's relationship to Fengtai is correct, and her underestimation of Zhouhe's determination could destroy the entire school. Is it going to be possible for Penghua's small school to remain \"ALL 1\" after this?",
