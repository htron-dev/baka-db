## Sinopse

She read Yukiko’s Spinach for the hundredth time. Was that really her looking so young? In the four years since then she had been the mangaka’s only model and love. This trip to the beautiful island of Enoshima was typical. They would find the best shooting locations, of course, but also enjoy each other.

It’s the rainy season and the hydrangeas are in full bloom. He knew she would leave soon...

A poignant, often droll tale from two of the most exciting creators in the medium today.
