## Sinopse

The first Nouvelle Manga ever produced, this is an autobiographical account detailing French artist Boilet's infatuation, courtship, affair and break-up with the eponymous Yukiko - a young Japanese woman who never attempts to disguise the fact that, whilst she might love Boilet, he is not the man she ultimately wants to be with. Yukiko not only becomes Boilet's lover but also his model and she thus becomes intimately entwined with his art. When she leaves him, he finds himself in need of a new muse - a story which is begun here and continued in the follow-up work, Mariko Parade.
