## Sinopse

The partner of the guy who detests gods, is human eating goddess.

In the midst of the intense heat of summer, the frozen corpse of a missing boy was found. Due to the strangeness of the incident, the police concluded it to be the works of the 'evil gods'....

From ancient times, there had been 'evil gods' whom would bring harm to the people of the country. The people whose job were to subjugate these 'evil gods' were known as 'Exorcists.' Exorcists who cumulatively or single-handedly founded their own organizations continued their battle with the gods—and then we reach the current age, where exists a genius who holds all the qualities of a exorcist, Furukawa Nanoka, yet abandoned the path of an exorcist, and lovable yet cruel, 'eating goddess' Latimeria. This forbidden combination between two races, a human and an 'evil god,' unbound by laws or common sense, will bury the sinister gods with their own reason and methods.
