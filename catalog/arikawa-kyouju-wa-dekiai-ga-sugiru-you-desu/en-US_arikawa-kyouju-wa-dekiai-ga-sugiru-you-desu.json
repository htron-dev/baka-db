Which should mean they'll now live happily ever after, right...? When Mirei asks if she can go to an after party with her friend, Mr. Arikawa tells her he needs to leave his mark on her, so no one gets any ideas. Her body can't help but respond to his skillful ways...! She knows it's wrong, but she likes how possessive he is. Will someone walk in on this sweet punishment...?\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
