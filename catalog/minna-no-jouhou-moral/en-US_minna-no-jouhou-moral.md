## Sinopse

A 3-volume OVA series meant to teach middle and high school children internet safety, manners when it comes to online content (eg. don't force a friend to take a selfie with you just so that you can post it online for "likes". Consider the other person's feelings.), phishing and catfishing, "pranks", hacking, micro-transactions in games, "Craigslist deal gone bad" (eg. a girl is nearly mugged and raped when she went to a meeting place to buy tickets for a sold out concert), trolling, and libel.
