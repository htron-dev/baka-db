## Sinopse

Sakuto, a company employee, Kousuke, a bar manager and Yuutarou, a shop manager, met in college and have been close friends ever since. Although their sexualities, jobs and personalities are different, all three have on thing in common: each has lost his grip on life, friendship and love. Their determination to overcome these bad experiences and move forward binds them together.

(Printemps Shuppan, translated)
