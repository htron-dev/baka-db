    "sinopse": "A photograph of a seated heterosexual couple, naked apart from their long necklaces, is rephotographed with a fixed camera that zooms outwards in one take. The colors subtly shift as the camera zooms out from their arm to eventually reveal their bodies over twelve minutes. Screened at the 3rd Sogetsu Animation Festival 1971.\n\n(Source: Collaborative Cataloging Japan)",
