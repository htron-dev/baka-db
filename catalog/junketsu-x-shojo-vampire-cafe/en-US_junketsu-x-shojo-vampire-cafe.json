    "sinopse": "While sleeping in class one day, Yuna has an intense, sexual dream where she is making love to a handsome stranger. However, she gets the shock of her life when she and her friend Mayuko go to Rouge Garden—a popular cafe with gorgeous workers—after school, as it is here that she finds out the stranger from her dream is actually one of the waiters! This man, Tomoya, is easily one of the most sought-after waiters of the cafe, and there is no end to the number of girls who want him all to themselves. But there is more to Tomoya and the other Rouge Garden employees than meets the eye, and soon, Yuna's dream becomes more of a reality than a fantasy.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
