## Sinopse

Having been born with an ability to destroy things without having to touch them, a man was abandoned by his mother when he was a child. His name long forgotten, he continues to travel aimlessly, crossing paths with those with superhuman powers along the way. These encounters are perhaps brought about by his own power.
