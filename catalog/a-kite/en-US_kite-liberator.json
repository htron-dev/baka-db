    "sinopse": "In the previous series \"Kite,\" a killer—Sawa—suddenly disappears after she avenges her parents' death, and no one knows where she is.\n\nSeveral years later, a figure dances airily on the dark side of a big city. She is an angel of death, killing her victim gracefully and disappearing.\n\nMonaka is a normal high school student, though this quiet and modest life has a darker side. An angel of death is Monaka's other persona.",
