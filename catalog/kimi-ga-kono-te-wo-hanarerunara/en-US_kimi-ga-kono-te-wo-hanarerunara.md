   At a class reunion, Hazuki was reunited with his classmate, Watari with whom he used to have a relationship.

Those hot summer days that lead to the unstoppable urge to feel… Now that it came to mind, love was what it was. Will a reunion after 5 years apart reignite again the passion that was once there? (from Blissful Sin)
