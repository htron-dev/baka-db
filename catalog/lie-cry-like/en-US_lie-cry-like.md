Nozomi Towada is a popular actor, and ranked as the Number 1 Most Beautiful Man. But because of his arrogant behaviour in contrast to his looks, he has always driven away the people around him. One day, after a word from Towada, Tani is made to become Towada's personal hair and make-up artist and take care of everything around him.
