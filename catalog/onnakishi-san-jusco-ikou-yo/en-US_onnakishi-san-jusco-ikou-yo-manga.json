    "sinopse": "Once upon a time in the small town of Hiraya, Nagano Prefecture, lived a normal high schooler, Seta Rinichirou.\n\nOn one stormy night, he stumbled upon Princess Polilyfa and the Female Knight (Valkyrie) who served her, Krauzera, collapsed in the middle of paddy field. Both of them had escaped using Gate magic from their country which fell to Orc army attack. And now they decide to establish a government in exile at Rinichirou house.\n\nBetween jealous stalker childhood friend, Polilyfa, and Krauzera fascination at Japanese modern technology and culture, and super-dense Rinichirounium, a slapstick comedy choked with otaku culture reference in a rural Nagano countryside will begin!\n\n(Source: Novel Updates)",
