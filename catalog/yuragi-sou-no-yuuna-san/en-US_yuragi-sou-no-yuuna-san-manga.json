    "sinopse": "Kogarashi Fuyuzora has been haunted by the supernatural since birth, which possesses him at every opportunity. This eventually led to him being thrown out of his apartment and starting a vagrant life as an exorcist. One day, he discovers the Yuragi Manor, a boarding house with suspiciously cheap rent. Formerly a hot springs inn, legend has it that a student's body was found there, which has haunted it ever since. Eager to have a roof to live under and exorcise ghosts in the meantime, Kogarashi begins his stay at the manor.\n\nWhile relaxing in the hot springs, Kogarashi happens to encounter this rumored ghost. However, as he prepares to exorcise it, the malevolent ghost turns out to be a charming silver-haired girl! Having no intention to harm her, Kogarashi decides to help the ghost—who he learns is called Yuuna—discover her regrets so she can move on to the afterlife before she turns into an evil spirit.\n\nThus begins Kogarashi's life in Yuragi Manor. Accompanied by its peculiar residents and a beautiful ghost, he endeavors to help Yuuna find peace before it is too late.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
