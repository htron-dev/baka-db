He was too surprised to retaliate, but the smell that tickled his nose was… of Sakuma?! In addition he tells Takimoto to sleep with him tonight\"?!\n\nTakimoto, who couldn't refuse an elite superior is now being used all over the place! And the appearance of a troublesome yandere-ikemen, Iwase Yuutarou, doesn't help either.\n\nA bitter love, where the guys' wounds and secrets overlap, is here.\n\n(Source: justpeachyicedtea)",
