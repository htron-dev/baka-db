## Sinopse

There's a famous person at my school. He's a young high school student who's a well-known novelist, and he's good looking and smart. There are rumors that he's a little weird, but teachers say that he's quick at learning. It turns out that I have to confess to that famous person, Komaki-senpai, for my friend. That was the start of our friendship, but there's a rumor that Komaki-senpai sleeps with teachers...
