    "sinopse": "Hae Jun is obsessed with Sae Young. He wants her to be his, but he also wants her to come freely to him so he targets her sister instead. Wanting to protect her, Sae Young finally gives in to Jun's pressure and agrees to be \"his woman.\" She expects him to treat her horribly, but from time to time she starts to see a gentle side of him. Her sister is also not the victim who she poses to be and little by little Sae Young finds herself trapped in some very twisted \"love games.\" Is what Hae Jun claims to feel for her really love?\n\n(Source: Evil Flowers)",
