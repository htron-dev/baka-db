    "sinopse": "Fast food part-timer, Tachibana Souta receives a love confession over the counter from one of the regulars, a salaryman named Kanzaki Tooru. Because he was causing a scene over the register, Souta relents and gives him his e-mail. After that, he gets messages from him every single day. He thought nothing of them at first, but they've been coming in persistently and Souta slowly came to anticipate these messages. But one time, when Souta rejects Kanzaki as per usual, the man tells him, \"I won't come to see you anymore.\"\n\n(Source: Yaoi Is Life, Hoshikuzuu Scans, STK Scanlations)",
