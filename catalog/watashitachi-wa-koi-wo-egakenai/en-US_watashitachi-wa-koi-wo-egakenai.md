## Sinopse

Onodera Kano and Nanase Miyuu have recently made their debut as a manga author duo with Kano writing the story and Miyuu drawing the art. However, Miyuu needs some help drawing love scenes, so she gets Kano to agree to act as her "boyfriend" to keep their manga aspirations alive. The only problem is that Kano has mixed feelings about it because she secretly harbors feelings for Miyuu.
