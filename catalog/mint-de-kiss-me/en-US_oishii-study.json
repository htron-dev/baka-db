    "sinopse": "Ringo Itsuki is the top student of her freshman class with one talent: studying. Coerced into tutoring the abrasive upperclassman, Budou Tsurugi (brother of the resident Mr. Popular, Minori Tsurugi), Ringo unwittingly finds herself butting heads with Budou more often than getting any actual tutoring done. In an attempt to find out what makes Budou so reluctant to study, Ringo spies on him. She discovers a whole other facet to Budou's harsh character, and soon finds herself falling for him.",
