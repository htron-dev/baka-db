    "sinopse": "Akio Kosato is well-known by the girls in his school for his skill in creating \"love potions,\" though he himself receives no romantic attention. That changes when a mysterious girl named Chidori appears and gives him far more attention than he ever wanted. It turns out that Chidori is Akio's long-forgotten cousin, and there may be much more to Akio's family than he realizes.\n\n(Source: XLG)",
