## Sinopse

Ever since he was kicked out of his previous friend's rock band, Hoshino gave up playing the guitar... until he couldn't take his high school student's life anymore which led him to decide to create a new band. Maybe they will never become famous, maybe they will face a great amount of difficulties for months before being able to play live, but that's not important! What is important, is to enjoy yourself, let out everything, to feel music sound within yourself!
