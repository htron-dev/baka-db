## Sinopse

The students' association of Lexington High School is always broke, so it's time for them to pick up some odd jobs. Jobs like… ghost-hunting? It's just another normal semester at this school for sorcerers. Join plucky president Shingiru, Teoh the brainy V.P., Roah the cosplaying secretary, and Kay the straight-laced treasurer as they band together to face both troublesome spirits AND some high school drama!
