## Sinopse

Shima Akio and Soma Yoshino are lovers, facing the reality of their fourth year in university. No matter how much they try to think things over, they can't quite figure out what to do with their parents, their friends, or even their own relationship.

This is the story of their youth. Youth fraught with pain and regret.
