    "sinopse": "For Nozaki Haruka, moving from Tokyo to the small town of Ootsuuma was life-changing... but not in a good way. Half a year later, Nozaki is miserable; she is relentlessly bullied by her classmates, who use her as an output for their pent-up rage and frustration. Though she could, Nozaki does not retaliate nor tell her parents, as she does not want to worry them. With this mentality, she is prepared to endure until graduation.\n\nBut when her bullies put her through a particularly harrowing ordeal, her parents become aware of the situation and allow Nozaki to stop attending school. However, this only instigates the bullies, forcing them to take an irreversible step which shatters her world forever. Now utterly devastated, a burning ferocity begins to swell within Nozaki, one which her bullies can only hope to escape from.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
