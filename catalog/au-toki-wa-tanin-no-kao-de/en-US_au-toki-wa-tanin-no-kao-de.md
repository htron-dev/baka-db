## Sinopse

In the darkness of her bedroom, an unknown intruder steals a kiss from Elena's lips. She initially yields to an experience unlike any other before she pushes away her assailant, an Italian count named Angelo. A tremendous flirt she had met earlier that day at a party, he lives in a glamorous world completely unlike her own. It seems he expected to rendezvous with Elena's cousin, but mistook their bedrooms...however, their kiss was witnessed by others, and to prevent a scandal, the count's grandmother orders them to be betrothed!
