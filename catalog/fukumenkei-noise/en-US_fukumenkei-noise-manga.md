## Sinopse

When they were young, Nino Arisugawa and Momo Sakaki had promised that if they were ever separated, they would use their song to find each other again. However, Momo moved away without notice, leaving Nino with a constant urge to scream. For this reason, she begins wearing a mask.

During this time, while still missing her first love, Nino encounters Kanada "Yuzu" Yuzuriha, a boy her age who composes music and gives her the nickname "Alice." Nino falls in love with his music, while Yuzu falls in love with her. Every Wednesday they would meet at the beach—but one day, Yuzu also stops coming.

Six years later, Nino and Yuzu reunite in high school—unbeknownst to her, Momo has also entered the same school. Holding on to the childhood promise she made with him, Nino sings Yuzu's songs, hoping that her voice can still reach Momo. However, while she tirelessly tries to reach him, Yuzu continues to long for her, escalating a love triangle that has been built across years of separation.
