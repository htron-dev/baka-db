## Sinopse

Hibari, who has started working part-time at an antique store, has noticed that its calm and elegant owner, Setsuka, doesn't have the slightest interest in anything other than antiques and thus decides to leave him be. Setsuka, however, falls in love with the cute and serious Hibari at first sight, but he's never had much luck in love before... Love suddenly comes to an antique store steeped in history.

Also includes the story "Benriya-san Irimasen ka".
