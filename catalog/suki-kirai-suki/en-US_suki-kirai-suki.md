## Sinopse

He hates to lose and is a little shorter than other boys. A little cheeky, but when he smiles, he's really cute. This is the Miyamoto that Hitomi loves so much. Just before the entrance exam for high school, she has two chances to make a confession. But she is dazzled and doesn't really have to courage to do it, so she decides to leave it for after the exam. Or at least that's what she thought...
This is a very popular story about love, which makes the heart go "squeak"!!

Also contains the one-shot story: 23:55 I Love You
