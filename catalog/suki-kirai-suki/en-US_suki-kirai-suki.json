Just before the entrance exam for high school, she has two chances to make a confession. But she is dazzled and doesn't really have to courage to do it, so she decides to leave it for after the exam. Or at least that's what she thought...\nThis is a very popular story about love, which makes the heart go \"squeak\"!!\n\nAlso contains the one-shot story: 23:55 I Love You\n\n(source: Manga Fox)",
