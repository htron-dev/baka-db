    "sinopse": "A messenger's job is to support the gods, maintain their purity, and protect them from any potential threat. Shin has always desired to serve a god, but despite being a messenger, he is unable to get assigned to one. In addition to being a notorious troublemaker, Shin possesses extremely tiny wings which render him flightless and therefore unfit for the role.\n\nAfter causing a ruckus at the summit, Shin is finally appointed to a god; however, this particular one lives the farthest from the main mountain residing on \"Mountain 32.\" Nonetheless, he is happy to have found a master and—upon arrival—immediately begins serving the giant, seemingly immobile god.\n\nHowever, while Shin carries out his duties, the disappearances of other gods and messengers are slowly alarming the rest of the area's inhabitants. Shin is unaware of his vanishing companions, but does his god know something?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
