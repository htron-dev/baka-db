## Sinopse

In a world where human "professions" are determined by nature, there was a person who was the strongest, despite being "jobless." Fuuta, who trained harder than anyone else to achieve this and became a champion was cast out and exiled. At the end of his wandering, he was picked up by Lilac M Fangini, the first princess and ruler of a city.
