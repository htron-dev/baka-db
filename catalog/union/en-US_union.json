Just when he was thinking of trying to cure his phobia no matter what, a beautiful girl called Uni suddenly appears in front of him, and that's not all, that girl says she's the daughter of the alien woman who kidnapped and that her mother won an award by investigating him. Her mother feels truly grateful for this so she sent Uni to repay Yuuta with anything he desires and told her not to come back before she does it. What will happen after Yuuta asks her to cure his phobia in the least painful way possible?\n\n(Source: Casanova)",
