    "sinopse": "Comics Underground Japan presents the wild, subversive world of Japan’s most accomplished underground comics artists. Some of the dozen artists included in this anthology will be familiar to followers of manga; others make their American debut in these pages. The richly imaginative stories in this volume show a great range of graphic style, from painstakingly detailed craftsmanship to exuberant, maniacal renderings. At the heart of each work in this anthology is a unique personal vision and a fierce artistic compulsion–these manga artists are the misfits of the art form, and they are its visionaries. (Source: Blast Books)\n\nIncluded stories are:\n\n1. \"Hell's Angel\" by Yoshikaze Ebisu\n2. \"It's All Right if Yiu Don't Understand\" by Yoshikaze Ebisu\n3. \"Steel Pipe Melancholia\" by Masakazu Toma\n4. \"Future Sperm Brazil\" by Takashi Nemoto\n5. \"A Love Like Lemons\" by Carol Shimoda\n6. \"Selfish Carol's Summer Vacation\" by Carol Shimoda\n7. \"Mercy Flesh (Jiniku)\" by Kazuichi Hanawa\n8. \"Don Quixote #1 & #2\" by Yasuji Tanioka\n9. \"Planet of the Jap\" by Suehiro Maruo\n10. \"Mary’s Asshole\" by Hanako Yamada\n11. \"Volvox\" by Pan Migawa\n12. \"Bigger and Better\" by Muddy Wehara\n13. \"Laughing Ball\" by Hideshi Hino\n14. \"Cat Noodle Soup\" by Hajime Yamano & Nekojiru",
