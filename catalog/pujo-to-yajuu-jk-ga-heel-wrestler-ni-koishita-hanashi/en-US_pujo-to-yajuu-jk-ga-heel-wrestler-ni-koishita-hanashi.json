    "sinopse": "Pujo to Yajuu is a funny love story about a high school girl called Momoka who loves wrestling, and Kuga, a wrestler who looks like a bad guy and often plays the villain but has actually a pure heart. Momoka is a huge fan of Kuga and keeps sending him supportive messages on Twitter. She even sent him a fan letter and one day after one of his matches he suddenly calls her... That's how the clumsy love story of those two starts.\n\n(Source: Martina Trlica of MANGA.TOKYO)",
