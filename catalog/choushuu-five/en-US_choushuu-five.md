## Sinopse

I want to see a country called “England”.

The timeline’s during Bakumatsu, an era where smuggling is the subjected to the capital punishment of death. There were five people who put their life on the line and sailed over to England.

Bringing with them their enthusiasm and goal to create a new Japan, these young souls traveled out of Japan. One day, they will be “known” for their contribution that they have left, this is the start of the journey of these young souls…!
