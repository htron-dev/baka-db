## Sinopse

We encounter a very impoverished woman who ekes out a living by answering SNS posts offering money for sexual favors. She lives in a net cafe, often eats only one meal a day, has trouble speaking to people and is considered ugly in appearance.

Shuuji is a slacker college kid who spends his nights doing amateur video broadcasts, but he is running out of material, which he needs to attract viewers and ad money.

One day he meets the woman at a certain fast-food chain, who becomes unraveled after realizing she doesn't have enough money to maintain her already penurious lifestyle. At long last Shuuji has found his toy—a toy he and his viewers are free to break at any time.
