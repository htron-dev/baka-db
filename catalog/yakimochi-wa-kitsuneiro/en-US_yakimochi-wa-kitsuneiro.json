    "sinopse": "Akiha came to Tokyo to attend school, but on his first day, he's molested on a crowded train. Surprised by it, he was struck dumb but one young man stepped in to help. As they talked, he suddenly hugged the young man to thank him...? A slapstick love story between a college student who is loved by animals and a pure new student who is possessed by a fox!\n\n(Source: Home-sha, translated)",
