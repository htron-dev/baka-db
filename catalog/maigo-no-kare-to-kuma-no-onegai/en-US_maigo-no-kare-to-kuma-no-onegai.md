## Sinopse

One evening, solo courier Ronet, a child who lost his home due to conflict, rescues the beautiful youth Bear from being raped by a neighborhood thug. Bear, completely ignorant of the real world, says he's headed to Ronet's homeland, now a cursed forest. Bear asks Ronet to act as his guide, but he refuses. Bear then transforms into a stuffed toy before Ronet's very eyes?!
