## Sinopse

Mei is a twelfth grader in an escalator school system and has a crush on her upperclassman, Takaoka. Meanwhile, she has been annoyed by the pursuit of an eighth grader named Masami. At almost the same time, however, she finds out that Takaoka already has a girlfriend. Meanwhile, Masami starts to show impatience and begins to distance himself from Mei due to being refused repeatedly. Suddenly, she realizes that her crush on Takaoka is merely an admiration and that she has already falled in love with Masami.
