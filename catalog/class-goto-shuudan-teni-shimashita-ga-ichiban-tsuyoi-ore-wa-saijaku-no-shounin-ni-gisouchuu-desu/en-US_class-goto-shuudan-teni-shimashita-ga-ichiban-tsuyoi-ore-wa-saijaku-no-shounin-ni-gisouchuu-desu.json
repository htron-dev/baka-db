    "sinopse": "I, Aruto Takayama, was summoned again in replay mode, keeping all of my past stats. This time, a large Hero's Summoning was conducted, which brought along the whole class. Sick of doing the job of a Hero, I hid my stats from the others and chose to become a merchant. But, I must have hidden my stats so well that our summoner thought I was trash and was cast aside. So, I decided to form a party with the three beauties in my class who were similarly thought to be useless (a tsundere, a lolita and a meek girl)! But, it's okay. I still have my Item Box and Item Shop. I'll just have to make whatever it is I need! And so, I led a relaxed life in another world creating items DIY and hawking, but... The Dragon Demon Lord and my past wife, a succubus comes knocking on my doorstep and seeking love. It seems that the transmigration this time is going to be troublesome yet again!\n\n(Source: Futabasha, translated)",
