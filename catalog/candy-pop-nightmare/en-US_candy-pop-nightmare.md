## Sinopse

The "heroic punk action" manga follows Asuka Yagami as he transfers into an academy where whispered rumors speak of a terrifying, mysterious entity known as the "Unknown." In short order, Makina Himekawa of the school's disciplinary committee confiscates and searches Yagami's bag. Arisu Kokonoe and other students discover that all is not as it seems for Asuka.
