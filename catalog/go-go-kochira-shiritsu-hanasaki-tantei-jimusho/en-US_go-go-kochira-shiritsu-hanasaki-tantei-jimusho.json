    "sinopse": "Kokindaichi Kotaro just recently got accepted to work at the Hanasaki Detective Agency and can’t wait to get real work experience as a Private Investigator. Headed by a young beautiful woman named Hanasaki, her crew of detectives is nothing you would expect. They spend a majority of their times doing nothing and fooling around with no real case to work on. Kotaro tries to learn as much as he can, but the unprofessional work atmosphere makes it really hard. Just when he's about to give up, he sees what amazing potential each member of the agency has.\n\n(Source: M-U)",
