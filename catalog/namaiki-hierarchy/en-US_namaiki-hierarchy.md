## Sinopse

From middle school, high school to university, Yui’s kouhai, Mikki, has always been chasing after Yui. Even though Mikki talks cheekily all the time, he seems fond of Yui… Unconsciously, Yui started feeling a sense of superiority over Mikki and ends up getting ahead of himself, hence provoking Mikki…?!
