## Sinopse

Ribbons and lace... Jin loves those kinds of cute things and because of that, he's out of place in his class. His only friend is "Suzume," a mysterious sparrow that can understand human language. Suddenly, a boy named "Suzume" appears and declares he wants to be his friend. While bewildered, Jin is attracted to the kind and strong Suzume, but then he reveals that they can only be together for one year...

An inter-species love between a sparrow boy and a kind-hearted lonely boy!
