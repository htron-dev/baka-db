## Sinopse

Mugi is a chubby girl with a kind spirit and beautiful smile. She is comfortable with her weight, but thought that she would never have the opportunity to fall in love. When she meets Tagami, a boy who is a "pochama," or someone who likes soft and squishy things, love has a chance to blossom, and Mugi comes to realize that she loves herself as is.
