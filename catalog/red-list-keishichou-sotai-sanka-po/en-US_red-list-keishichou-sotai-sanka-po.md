## Sinopse

Hikaru Kago is a former yakuza roped into cooperation with the police through plea bargaining. Takaomi Togasawa is an elite cop who'd rather be doing desk work. Follow the improbable duo as they survive each day as protection officers in charge of yakuza victims or targets, and find out why their assignment is called "the last bureau before heaven!"
