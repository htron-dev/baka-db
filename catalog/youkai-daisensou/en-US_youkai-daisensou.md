## Sinopse

A timid young boy named Tadashi moves to a small town after the divorce of his parents. At a local festival, he is picked to be that year's "Kirin Rider," a protector of all things good. He soon discovers that his new title is quite literal, as a nefarious spirit named Kato appears. Originally a human who became a demon from the strength of his hatred for humans, Kato desires vengeance against their actions on the Youkai. To carry out his revenge, Kato allies himself with a Youkai named Hanako while he summons a fiery spirit called Yomotsumono, composed of the resentment of the many things which mankind has discarded.
By capturing other Yokai and burning them in the flames of Yomotsumono, he is able conjure up a manifestion of Yomotsumono known as "Nanjara-Monjara", a fearsome Yokai covered in tentacles that can fly.

Tadashi is mankind's last hope as he begins his quest to claim the "Holy sword" from it's protector, the Great Tengu before joining forces with all the Yokai that reside along the Mizuki Road to defeat the evil Kato once and for all.

Though 220 pages in length, Yokai Daisenso reads like an epic One Shot in as much as there are no chapters. It reads straight through from start to finish without any intervals.
