    "sinopse": "\"He's annoying, overly familiar, and to be honest, he makes me feel uncomfortable, until I saw that side profile.\"\n\nTsuga, who is fed up with the alpha supremacy of the world, has lived his life with a sense of propriety despite his alpha status. One day, however, he sees his least favorite classmate, Matsumae, staring blankly at the river from a bridge. Matsumae who is usually boisterous, was seen with an uncharacteristic side profile by Tsuga, and from then on, Tsuga couldn't leave him alone?!\n\n(Source: Libre, translated)",
