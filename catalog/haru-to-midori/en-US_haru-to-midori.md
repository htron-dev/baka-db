## Sinopse

Midori isn't good with people, and at 31 years old, she feels like she has no place in life. One day, she attends Tsugumi's funeral, a close friend of hers from junior high school. Unable to forget about her, she has a vision of the young friend she knew standing above her – only it isn't the girl she once knew, but her daughter, Haruko.

This is a story of the relationship between a woman without a place and a child without a mother.
