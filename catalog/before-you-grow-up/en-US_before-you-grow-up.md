## Sinopse

Before You Grow Up is a oneshot based off of a 10-year-olds insecurities about his love-relationship with a 23-year old man. Said 23-year-old man is what one would call a shotacon, his eyes always glued to elementary school boys. One day, the 10-year-old lover confesses his frustration to the school doctor who gives him a pill that puts him to sleep. The doctor calls his adult lover to see how the man reacts and when he comes rushing to his younger lovers side, the truth and purity about his feelings are revealed.
