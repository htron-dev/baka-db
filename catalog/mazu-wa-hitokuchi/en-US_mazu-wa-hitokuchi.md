## Sinopse

Oda and Hasegawa are childhood friends bound by a very special secret: Oda's a third-generation pig farmer on a farm that raises FLYING PIGS. When a nosy reporter starts investigating tales of upward-mobile porkers in the area, the two must band together (and thereby grow closer in doing so) to protect Oda's family's livelihood as well as the good-luck-giving swine.
