Both treasure each other and the relatioship they have, but soon unable to say what they really feel or ask for what they really want they for a time start to drift apart, until the distance and a \"final\" chess match decides once and for all what they both wanted all along.\n\n6: Holding hands together is about two cousins.\n\n7: Getting close to a cat\n\n(Source: M-U)",
