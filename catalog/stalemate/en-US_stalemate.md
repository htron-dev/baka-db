## Sinopse

1-4+extra: Shinichi and his uncle (Chiharu) have always had a close relationship, meeting almost everyday to play games and would have chess matches together all the way through to his high-school years. Both treasure each other and the relatioship they have, but soon unable to say what they really feel or ask for what they really want they for a time start to drift apart, until the distance and a "final" chess match decides once and for all what they both wanted all along.

6: Holding hands together is about two cousins.

7: Getting close to a cat
