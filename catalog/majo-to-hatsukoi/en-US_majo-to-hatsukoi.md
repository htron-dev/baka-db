## Sinopse

Sixteen-year-old Seira Murahoshi has the unique ability to detect the auras of those around her, which causes Seira's schoolmates to distance themselves from her and label her as a witch. Because of this, Seira wears sunglasses to Himesaki Girls' Academy out of respect for the privacy of her peers—with the exception being her only friend Mika Torino, who asks Seira to give her tarot readings.

One day, Seira's sunglasses are knocked off by a boy enveloped in a glittering aura who asks if she is the infamous "Witch of Himesaki," known for her eyes of petrification. Seira is not the only one left speechless—Mika is instantly enamored by the stranger's friend, who apologizes on his behalf. After the encounter, Mika expresses disappointment in potentially never seeing him again, which motivates Seira to locate her friend's newfound crush. Her search leads her to the neighboring all-boys Miyakita Industrial High School, where she reunites with the mysterious boy from earlier. However, this time around, his aura exhibits radiance even brighter than before.
