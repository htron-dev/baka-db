## Sinopse

Kengou Kuroi may be part of the Kuroguro group, but he cares greatly for the neighborhood he grew up in. He resolutely plans to keep his yakuza affairs as far away from it as possible. However, one persistent issue seemingly follows him around: his childhood friend, Touma Shirakaba, who brazenly confesses to Kuroi at every opportunity since Kuroi's inauguration as wakagashira—second-in-command of the yakuza—seven years ago.

Shirakaba's unwavering presence has since become a common sight at the group's base. His sharp features and fierce looks even cause the other members to forget that he is an ordinary citizen. By creating some distance between them, Kuroi tries to keep Shirakaba's hands clean. However, his plan soon backfires as Shirakaba voluntarily joins the Kuroguro group as its new legal advisor.
