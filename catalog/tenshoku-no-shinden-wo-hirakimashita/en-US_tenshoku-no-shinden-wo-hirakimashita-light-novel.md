## Sinopse

For people born as villagers, no matter how hard they work, they cannot change their status as a villager, nor there is any way for them to become swordsmen. This is a world where peoples' lives are determined by what "job" they are assigned at birth. And it is to this world, that one young man gifted with a certain ability, was summoned.
