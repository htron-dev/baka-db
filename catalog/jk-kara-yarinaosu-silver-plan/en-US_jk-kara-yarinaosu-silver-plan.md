## Sinopse

Her grandfather is a politician, and her father is a real estate owner.
Sayuri Ninomiya is an arrogant young lady who had the culmination of power and wealth during the bubble period.
However, it all came down together with the collapse of the bubble. Eventually, she became a middle-aged homeless person.

One day, a delinquent threw a rock at her. Just when Sayuri thought she had died while clinging to her past happiness, she somehow time leaped to the days of her high school period...!?

To save her family from the tragic future that awaits them and gaining hold of true happiness by not relying on money, she comes up with a "Silver Plan" by putting all her effort to make friends, save money, be healthy and more. Sayuri's second life begins now!
