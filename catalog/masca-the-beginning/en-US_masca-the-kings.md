## Sinopse

Did you think Masca: The Tale of the Great Mage of Hessed was over? Masca: the Kings is the sequel of Masca, in which Asarella goes on a journey to save Kainen. However, the first two volumes focus quite a bit on the development between Rea and Rakin (Kainen's beautiful ex(?) and another demon king).
