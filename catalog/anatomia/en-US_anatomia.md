## Sinopse

Luther has fallen in love with Eva. Luther is a young art student and Eva is his eccentric professor. Luther tries to convince Eva their connection is true love, unaware of the dark past that imprisons and tortures Eva’s soul. Is what forms between them love or merely intense infatuation? Anatomia is an intriguing spiritual love story about the healing powers of love and it’s ability to overcome hardship.
