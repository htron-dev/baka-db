## Sinopse

Mika Kamiya is a young woman who is a "magic printer"—that is, she helps to create grimoires and other mystic books which witches and wizards can use. However, she cannot use any magic herself. Desperate to find a spell which can send her back to her homeworld, Mika decides to create a completely magical market, where magicians can trade and show off their creations.
