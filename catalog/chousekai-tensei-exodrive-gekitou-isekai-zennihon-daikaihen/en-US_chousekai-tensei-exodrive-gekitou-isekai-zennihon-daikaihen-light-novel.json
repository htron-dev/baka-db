    "sinopse": "In the not-so-distant future, isekai is a way of life. Now the world has perfected hitting an average teenager with a truck so they're reborn into a new world for a fantasy adventure. How do you raise the stakes? Set up a televised tournament, of course! Now roaring crowds can follow a chosen Hero through his death, rebirth, and quest to save another world, armed with special tech for Cheat skills, stat indexes, and whatever else is needed. Surely this is all in good fun and no one would abuse this kind of reincarnation technology...!\n\n(Source: MU)",
