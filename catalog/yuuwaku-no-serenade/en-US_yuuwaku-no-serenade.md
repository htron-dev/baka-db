## Sinopse

Olivia, an interior designer, was introduced to Charles by her friend Ria. Charles is a billionaire who offers to lend money to Olivia so she can fulfill her dream: opening her own design agency. The shop is opened and is very successful. One day Charles suddenly dies. His son-in-law, Edward, is convinced that Olivia was his lover. Charles's lover was actually Ria, but the tabloids spread false information; now everyone is convinced that it was Olivia. Now Olivia has to find Ria, who has disappeared to escape the media, so that Edward knows the truth!
