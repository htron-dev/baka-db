    "sinopse": "Well well, if Tomomi only knew. When she first saw her new brother-in-law, Shishimaru, at age 10, she at once decided that he looked effeminate and she had to do something about it! So she got him interested in football, he went to the USA to study football... and now he's back, still looks extremely effeminate, and Tomomi falls for him! But what about Guy, his best friend who came along with Shishimaru and acts extremely protective of him? Is he Shishimaru's boyfriend? Sort of... it's just that Shishimaru doesn't know anything about it. And so a really weird love triangle between those three people begins.\n\n(Source: PRISMS, edited)",
