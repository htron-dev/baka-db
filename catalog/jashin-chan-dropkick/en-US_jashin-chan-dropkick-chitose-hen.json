    "sinopse": "The episode will be funded through Chitose's Hometown tax program, a system that allows taxpayers who live in urban areas to contribute to taxes that apply to rural residents. Taxpayers who contribute over 2,000 yen are then awarded in credit to reduce their income tax and residence tax. The Hometown tax program will also be the episode's focus.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
