## Sinopse

"Kare Kura! ~ A little bit dangerous extracurricular "love" activity ~". Ikeuchi is a girl without a boyfriend for 17 years. The one she fell in love at first sight with belongs to the "Boyfriend club", aka "Kare Kura"! Isn't it weird to have to pay a club fee even though she's in love with him!? (Source: Intercross)

Also includes:
-Tear Drop Ouendan:
Hokuto and Natsu are twin simblings. Hokuto goes to a boy's high school but he's been forced into the Ouendan (cheering) group and is being bothered by Kuroda to the point he doesn't want to go to school anymore. So Natsu decides to take action, go to her brother's school in his place and put Kuroda in his place... or will she?

-GAKEN:
Mitsu just moved back to the house where she lived when she was 5 years old. She used to play with her twin brothers neighbors, Yuu and Ren. Though she doesn't remember much, she still holds precious the vow one of them made before she left. Believing it was Yuu, she joins the Eiga Kenkyuubu aka GAKEN (Movie Research Club) to get closer to him, though she'll have to stand being with the grumpy brother Ren, the club president.
