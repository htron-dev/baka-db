## Sinopse

Masaki has been modeling for the sole reason that he's in demand. One day, Usami, his lover-slash-photographer, tells Masaki that it's over between them and he's getting married. Dejected, Masaki loses interest in modeling, nothing matters anymore, and he becomes a recluse. It's then that a friend tells him about a live-in job. His new employer looks like a pleasant enough guy at first... but looks can be deceiving...!! What will happen between the top salesman who's interested in nothing but his work and Masaki, his live-in housekeeper...?
