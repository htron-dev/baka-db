## Sinopse

When Tae Yeon Im finds out that the idol star that she's adored for ages is currently attending the same school as her identical cousin, Jung-Woo Im, she convinces her cuz to exploit their similitude and switch places, she will dress as him, attend his school and try to get close to her lover boy. And he will dress as her, attend her school and revel in its sea of babes. Or maybe he just likes wearing a skirt? The plan seems flawless until Tae learns of a bully named Ga-Wun Kim who likes to beat up on poor Jung-Woo. Meanwhile, Jung-Woo finds that being a woman might not be as thrilling as it seems.
