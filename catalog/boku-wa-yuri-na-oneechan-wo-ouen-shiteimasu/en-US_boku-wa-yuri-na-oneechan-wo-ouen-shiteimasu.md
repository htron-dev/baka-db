## Sinopse

Shizuku Futaba is a lonely girl. She rarely talks to her classmates and always eats lunch alone. One day, a student named Saki Mikoshiba transfers to her class and is seated next to her. As Saki introduces herself to Shizuku, their conversation is interrupted when the other students in the class begin to introduce themselves to the new student. Despite distancing herself following her failed attempt to befriend Saki, Saki continuously dotes on Shizuku for the rest of the day—an act that baffles Shizuku.

Shizuku recounts the day's events to her younger brother, Mio, who frequently worries about his sister. Wanting to help resolve her uncertainty, he encourages Shizuku to further interact with Saki in hopes of making her first friend. However, what Mio doesn't realize is that Saki has a crush on Shizuku!
