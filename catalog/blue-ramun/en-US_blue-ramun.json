    "sinopse": "A girl named Jessie Jackson comes from a special tribe of Blue Ramun (Blue Blood). Their blood is used as medicine and healing agents for almost any sickness whether in its purest form or mixed in with other herbal remedies. As Jessie comes of age at 15, she must leave their tribe to help those in need and she is assigned to the Lezak district with the handsome captain named Eagle and happy-go-lucky doctor/priest Randy. As she is now alone without her tribe members with her, Jessie strives to fulfill the difficult task bestowed upon her, thereby learning the strength of not only her body, but her spirit as well.\n\n(Source: Aerandria)",
