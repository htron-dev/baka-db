    "sinopse": "Awed by the beauty and elegance of a one-piece dress in a shop window, aimless university student Nanako Kuwabara leans against the glass to take a closer look at it. Just then, the plain-spoken shop owner Hirata steps out to tell her off for soiling the window he had just cleaned. The atmosphere of the shop and the owner's attitude are all in sharp contrast to the superior quality of the dress, but nothing deters the lovestruck Nanako from trying it on. When Hirata expertly alters it to fit her to perfection, she is over the moon, but she can hardly afford the price he names. Fortunately, she has no reason to worry, for Hirata offers to hire her as a part-timer in exchange for the dress. And what's more, this couldn't have happened at a better time: she is going to graduate soon with no job and no idea what she wants to do. Hirata repeatedly insists that she will be working at the tailoring shop only until she has paid for that dress, but it looks like Nanako might have plenty of reasons to stick around for much longer.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
