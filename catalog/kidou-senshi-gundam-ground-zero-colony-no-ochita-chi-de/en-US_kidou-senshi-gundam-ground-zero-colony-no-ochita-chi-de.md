## Sinopse

Universal Century 0079. The One Year War, which started with the Principality of Zeon's declaration of war, took the largest toll in human history. Their first step, in particular, was a colony drop, which brought unprecedented damage to the Earth and in an instant, resulted in the death of half of mankind. This story depicts the road to recovery of a ravaged land, the hardest hit area of Australia: Ground Zero for the colony drop.
