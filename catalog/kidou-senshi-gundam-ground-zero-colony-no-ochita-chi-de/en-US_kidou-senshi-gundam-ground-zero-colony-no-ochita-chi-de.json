Their first step, in particular, was a colony drop, which brought unprecedented damage to the Earth and in an instant, resulted in the death of half of mankind. This story depicts the road to recovery of a ravaged land, the hardest hit area of Australia: Ground Zero for the colony drop.\n\n(Source: Zeonic Scanlations)",
