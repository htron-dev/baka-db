## Sinopse

College student Otonari Otoya is a boy who lacks self-esteem and dreams of being reborn into a different dimension. One day while playing a video game, he accidentally clicks on an ad, and trips into another world?!

He's surprised but delighted, until he realizes that something's strange. A whole group of guys are treating him too kindly, almost like he's a girl! Could it be that the world Otonari was transported into... is an otome game?!
