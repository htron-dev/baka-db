## Sinopse

Masaki Tachibana leaves home in order to escape an oppressive existence with his father. He shows up at his grandfather's house, uninvited, and decides to live there. A garden that he saw in dream; his grandfather and his bodyguard, Harada; an old mansion inhabited by a beautiful, strong-willed girl...

At this point, the curtain rises on a mysterious drama of love and hate!
