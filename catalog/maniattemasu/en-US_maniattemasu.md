From Shoujo Magic:
Homare is a lovely first year high school student who has been sold off to the Ichinokura family as payment for her parents\' debt. Although there are only guys in the Ichinokura family, they are all clean and kind, and Homare works hard as a pretty maid, including washing their underwear and their backs!
