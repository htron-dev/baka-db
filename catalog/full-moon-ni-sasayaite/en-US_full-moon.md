## Sinopse

David and Marlo are a newly wed couple looking for a new place to live. However, they aren't your ordinary couple—David is a vampire and Marlo is a man that transforms into a woman during the full moon! They come to the town of Reto, which is home to only supernatural beings like themselves and magicians. Even though they like the town, they soon are caught up in trouble with some of the current residents. Another vampire doesn't appreciate the perceived trespass on his feeding territory and sends his cute little girl magician to deal with the new problem.
