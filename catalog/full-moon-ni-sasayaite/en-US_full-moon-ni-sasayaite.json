    "sinopse": "Marlo has a problem. On the night of the full moon, this half-werewolf, half-vampire undergoes a mysterious and terrifying transformation:\n\nHe turns into a girl.\n\nDesperate for a cure, his parents call on Doctor Vincent, a long time family friend. But Marlo wants to keep his condition secret from Vincent's son, the vampire playboy David.\n\nUnfortunately, the secret gets out, and an old problem resurfaces: David has been interested in Marlo for years! If a remedy can't be found, their parents believe the next best solution is marriage—a marriage between Marlo and David!\n\n(Source: Broccoli, edited)",
