But soon after their arrival, Eito gets seriously injured during a disagreement and is thrown out of the sector. With his consciousness dimming, Eito sees a pack of zombies coming and resigns himself to his fate. But what does he discover when he wakes up? A story of a living dead anti-hero begins.\n\n(Source: MANGA Plus)",
