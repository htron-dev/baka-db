## Sinopse

I want to be seen as a woman! Not as a wife and mother!

Gina has been married to her wealthy, handsome husband, Reid, for seven years. They were blessed with adorable children and supposedly living a happy life as a married couple. But then Gina started to suspect that her husband was cheating on her, and it left her in a state of indecision... Now, to make matters worse, her husband has announced the unthinkable—he and his secretary are heading off on a business trip. The worst part is they'll be staying in the same suite! Has his heart moved on from Gina to another woman? In order to win him back, Gina's going to take drastic measures that will shock even her!
