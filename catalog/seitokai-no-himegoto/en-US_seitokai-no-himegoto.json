    "sinopse": "Shirayuri Girls' High School is a high school like any other. It has its own rules and regulations, and of course, you'd expect a Student Council to help maintain them. The Student Council itself, however, is a different problem entirely.\n\nA perverted President who likes girls, a tsukkomi Vice-President, an over-zealous Treasurer and a quiet, brooding Secretary. This unlikely quartet form Shirayuri Girls' High School's Student Council.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\n(Source: Batoto)",
