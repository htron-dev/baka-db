## Sinopse

Shirayuri Girls' High School is a high school like any other. It has its own rules and regulations, and of course, you'd expect a Student Council to help maintain them. The Student Council itself, however, is a different problem entirely.

A perverted President who likes girls, a tsukkomi Vice-President, an over-zealous Treasurer and a quiet, brooding Secretary. This unlikely quartet form Shirayuri Girls' High School's Student Council.

What could possibly go wrong?
