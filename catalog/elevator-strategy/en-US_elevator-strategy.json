    "sinopse": "Despite working at an elite I.T. company, Wataru's life is less than ideal. Bogged down with overtime and sacrificing weekends, Wataru rolls in and out of work half dead. But, when his sleep time is down...his horny levels are up. When one errant sleepy boner catches the attention of his coworker Jin, Wataru finds himself riding more than just the elevator at work.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
