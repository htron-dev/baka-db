## Sinopse

The story centers on the life of Kawata Yoshio, an eccentric judge.

The popularity of the series seems to stem from both the good-natured wisdom of its hero, Judge Kawata, and the glimpse it offers of Japan's judicial system as it deals with current social issues ranging from divorce to substance abuse.
