## Sinopse

This story is about the middle school student Nanami, who was abandoned by her father, Nagakawa, whose wife left him and took their son, and Nagakawa's son Kenta, who was abused by his mother's boyfriend. These three injured souls meet in a shabby apartment building, and rusted gears begin to turn.
