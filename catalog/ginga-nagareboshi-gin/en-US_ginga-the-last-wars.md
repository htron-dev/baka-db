## Sinopse

The dogs have been at peace, and all has seemingly gone well. However soon the monstrous bear Monsoon attacks, wanting to claim Futago Pass as his own. All the while getting vengeance for his father, Akakabuto who was killed by Gin during the events of Ginga Nagareboshi Gin. Victory is not assured for the dogs, as an aging Gin has started to go blind. And the Supreme Commander Weed is fatally injured by one of Monsoon's kin. Weed's children have been sent away for training, and are oblivious to the crisis at hand. Can the soldiers of Ouu defeat this new take on an old threat? Or is this truly be to their last fight?
