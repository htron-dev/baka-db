    "sinopse": "It was definitely out of the blue. Manato, my favorite brother, is adopted?! Even so, I still sleep beside him, just like when we were little, because I couldn't leave the brokenhearted Masato alone―His slender waist leaning against me, his hair which feels so soft and fluffy and his sexy expression when looking at me...\n\nI can't think of Manato as my older brother!\n\nA heart-warming love story about all of the five brothers of Takasuga family.\n\n(Source: Fujoshi Bitches)",
