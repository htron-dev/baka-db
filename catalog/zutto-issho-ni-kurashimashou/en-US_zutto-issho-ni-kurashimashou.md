## Sinopse

It was definitely out of the blue. Manato, my favorite brother, is adopted?! Even so, I still sleep beside him, just like when we were little, because I couldn't leave the brokenhearted Masato alone―His slender waist leaning against me, his hair which feels so soft and fluffy and his sexy expression when looking at me...

I can't think of Manato as my older brother!

A heart-warming love story about all of the five brothers of Takasuga family.
