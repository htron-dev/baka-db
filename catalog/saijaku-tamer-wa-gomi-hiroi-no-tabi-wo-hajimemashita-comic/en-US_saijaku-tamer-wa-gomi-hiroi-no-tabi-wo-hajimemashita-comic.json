    "sinopse": "When Ivy was born into this world, she remembered her past life. Remembering her preincarnation, she strove to avoid strife. But fate curdled at the status check, when kids learn who they are. For she had only one skill - Taming - and not a single star.\n\nIvy was weak from the start - at most, she could tame a slime. And in her world, most people did not give the weak their time. Only one woman in her village would treat her as her own. But after she \"died,\" Ivy got the hint and ran from home.\n\nWhile on the run, she met a tiny slime and named it Sora. And such begins the heartwarming survival story of a small girl who can tame.\n\n(Source: TO Books, translated)",
