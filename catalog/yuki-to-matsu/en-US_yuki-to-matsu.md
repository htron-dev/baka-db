## Sinopse

On a dark and snowy night, Sho-an drags home what he believes to be the corpse of a beautiful man. But, even though Sho-an is ready to reduce the body into medical supplies, he is dismayed to discover the body lives. Sho-an names his corpse-cum-patient Yuki and gains a houseguest that eats his food and keeps his bed warm throughout the year.
