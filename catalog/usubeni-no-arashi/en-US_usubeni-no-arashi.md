## Sinopse

It contains the short stories Storm of Light Pink Color, The Flowers That Look At The Sun, and The Last Unrequited Love.
The title story is a slice-of-life school sports manga about a pair of brothers who both play baseball. While the eldest is a pitcher for a top-tier team with chances at winning the prestigious Koshien tournament, the youngest is a mediocre player with an attitude who has never gotten over the death of their father several years prior.
