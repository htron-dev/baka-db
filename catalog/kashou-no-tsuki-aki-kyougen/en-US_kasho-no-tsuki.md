## Sinopse

Arimasa was a half-demon priest who cared nothing of what others thought of him. That was, until one fateful night, while on a mission to exorcise a gang of demons, he encounters Kagetsu, a clumsy cat demon who will eventually change his world, and more importantly, his views of it. (Source: M-U)
