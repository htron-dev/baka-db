    "sinopse": "Anthology of 3 stories.\n\n1. Ciao, My Darling - Shishimoto who makes his living as a computer wizard picks up down-on-his-luck Tomosaka and his cat Hana off the street. Shishimoto seems to really have it all together, while Tomosaka can't even hold down a job for any length of time -- but not all is well behind Shishimoto's gruff facade, and over time Tomosaka finds out what's wrong, and comes to care. But then he causes Shishimoto to lose a lot of work by pulling the computer plug at an inopportune time to save electricity (quibble: the mangaka doesn't understand computers). Shishimoto has to call in his female friend Mika to help, which pushes Tomosaka into confessing his love for Shishimoto. But Shishimoto doesn't react well to his confession.\n\n(Source: Manga Updates)",
