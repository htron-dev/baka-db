## Sinopse

Though his name may mean good luck, Daikichi is far from lucky. Losing his home and his job, he narrowly avoids being homeless when he finds an old abandoned apartment building. But the apartment isn't nearly as abandoned as it first appeared, as it's being occupied by the ghost of a girl who committed suicide there many years ago.

Volume 2: Arashi no Date
