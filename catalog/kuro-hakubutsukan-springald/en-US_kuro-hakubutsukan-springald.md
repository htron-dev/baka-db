## Sinopse

In the Scotland Yard, there is kept a famous miscellany of criminal memorabilia known as the Black Museum. It is rumored that some time in the mid-19th-century, evidence from a certain investigation undertaken by the London Police in 1837 was removed from the collection by persons unknown...

Within these pages, an account of monsters, villains, and men unfolds, chronicling a hidden history of the terror of Victorian England—the mysterious figure known in popular folklore as "Spring-Heeled Jack."
