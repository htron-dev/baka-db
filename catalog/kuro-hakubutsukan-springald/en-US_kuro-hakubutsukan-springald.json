It is rumored that some time in the mid-19th-century, evidence from a certain investigation undertaken by the London Police in 1837 was removed from the collection by persons unknown...\n\nWithin these pages, an account of monsters, villains, and men unfolds, chronicling a hidden history of the terror of Victorian England—the mysterious figure known in popular folklore as \"Spring-Heeled Jack.\"\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)\n\nAlso includes the Springald Ibun: Mother Goose.",
