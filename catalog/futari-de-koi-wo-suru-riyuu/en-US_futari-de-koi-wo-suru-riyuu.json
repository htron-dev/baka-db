Too flustered to ask for his name or contact information, she swears to take action the next time she falls in love. But it turns out he is a senpai at her school!? Reunited, Urara believes it must be fate. But before she can take action, his childhood friend Jun Misono tells her \"I won't hand Aiji-kun over to you.\" What will she do?\n\n(Source: Shueisha, translated)",
