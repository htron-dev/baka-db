## Sinopse

Hiragi Kuroto, was a natural born ability user, but didn't interact with people and lived as if he were a normal human, before the former god user---divine spirit named Fele appeared.

"Let's save the world together"
"I refuse"

Kuroto readily refused the request of being a savior, however due to frantic persuasion, ended up going on the journey. Along the way, they got involved with some unforeseen situation.
Despite it being difficult, they finally arrived at the other world, five hundred years later than they expected...the world that Kuroto, the boy who was to become the savior, arrived at was a world that had been saved a long time ago. Due to an unofficial savior, this is an anti-savior story where the entire world is made to be your enemy, start!
