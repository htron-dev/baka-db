## Sinopse

One day an ordinary 2nd year high-schooler named Usami Yuu accidentally encounters Takano Hitomi, a big girl with a scary looking face. It seems like she's glaring straight at him, but why...!? Although Hitomi looks scary and awkward, she's actually a kind and adorable girl who simply wants to become more sociable. This is a story containing happy, heartwarming slice-of-life comedy!
