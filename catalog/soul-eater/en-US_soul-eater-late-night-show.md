## Sinopse

Additional specials included in two Blu-ray Box volumes of Soul Eater.

Originally they were a part of late-night version of dual broadcast of Soul Eater; the regular Monday 6:00 p.m. version and a late-night "Soul Eater Late Show" version.

Special footage was added at the start and end of the commercial break; the next episode preview was also different from the regular version.
