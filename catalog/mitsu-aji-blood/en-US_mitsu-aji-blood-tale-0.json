Hinata begins spending all her free time with Junya and soon becomes romantically entangled with him, but she notices that he won't kiss her.\n\nHowever, one day Hinata sees something shocking: Junya drinking the blood of his assistant. She discovers that Junya is a vampire and that his novels are more fact than fiction. In the ensuing confusion, Junya kisses Hinata. And according to his novels, if a vampire kisses the one he loves, he can only drink their blood for the rest of his life. Mitsu-aji Blood: Tale 0 follows Hinata and Junya's new, unconventional relationship.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shots: Himegimi ni Koi no Hanataba wo, Hatsukoi, Yoru ni Tokeru",
