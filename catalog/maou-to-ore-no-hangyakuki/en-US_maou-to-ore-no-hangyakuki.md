## Sinopse

Suddenly transported to another world. Being called the ‘Suitable One’, with the world’s strongest power “Holy Sword”. He thought he would use that power to make a great impact in this new world. However, in this alternate world there are "inhumans"; Monsters that oppress the lands. Questioning his own convictions, he asked, is this correct? Who should he use this power for? This is the beginning of an Isekai battle fantasy!
