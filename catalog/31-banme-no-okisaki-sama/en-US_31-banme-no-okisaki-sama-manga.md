## Sinopse

Feria, the sister of a feudal lord, is chosen as the 31st consort to the king. With a system where the sovereign meets the consorts on their respective day of the month, Feria is not called upon too often. In this sidelined position, Feria is barely provided the basic necessities, and she takes it upon herself to manage the household. Rolling up her sleeves and getting her clothes dirty are all part of a hard day's work for the earnest consort.

After a long wait, King Macron and Consort Feria finally meet. Unlike the other consorts, who force themselves upon him and act haughty, Feria is a breath of fresh air. Feelings spark between them; to be together, they will have to overcome age-old customs and greedy nobles, but what awaits them is true love.
