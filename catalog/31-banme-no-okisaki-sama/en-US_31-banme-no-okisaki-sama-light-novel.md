The selection of the queen of King Macron of Da Nang has begun. Thirty-one princess candidates gather at the royal castle.

First day is for the first princess, second for the second princess, third for the third princess... No one wants to be the 31st princess, who can only only see the king once every three months. She was chosen to be Feria, the younger sister of a young lord of the Carodia territory, a remote area. Can Feria survive the battle of women?
