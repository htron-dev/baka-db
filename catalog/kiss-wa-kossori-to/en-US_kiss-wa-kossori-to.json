Saya Yagi's one wish is to hear \"that's delicious,\" from her boss, Ogami-kun. Hitsuji has somehow become entangled with older brother's friend, Shiro-sempai, who swears he needs her next to him to get a (totally innocent...) good night's rest. Usami can't seem to shake her troublesome younger classmate...until she finds maybe she didn't want to lose him after all.
