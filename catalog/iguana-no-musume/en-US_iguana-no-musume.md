## Sinopse

A high school senior without self-esteem thinks she's an iguana. Her mother claims that whenever she sees Rika, she sees an iguana instead of a real human. Because of this, Rika has never received or was shown any love by her mother. Rika's younger sister Mami has been getting all of the love and attention by the mother.
