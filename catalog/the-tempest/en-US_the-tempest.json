    "sinopse": "“WE ARE SUCH STUFF AS DREAMS ARE MADE ON,” Prospero tells his spellbound captives. Prospero, robbed of his dukedom, has been marooned for many years on a wild island with his daughter Miranda. Now, finally, he applies his magic skills to contrive a shipwreck and take revenge on his usurping brother and the faction who exiled him. Prospero summons spirits to bewitch and torment the castaways, but it is the greater power of love which triumphs in a happy ending.",
