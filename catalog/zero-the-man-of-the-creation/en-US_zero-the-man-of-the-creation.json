    "sinopse": "The man known as \"Zero\" is an expert on antiquities, archaeology, art, and other types of artifacts. Specifically, he is an expert on rooting out their histories and discovering any extra-special qualities they might have—curses and so on—and then gets rid of them, and he will search the world to find the answers he seeks for his clients. He charges whatever fee he feels is appropriate; it might be a million dollars, and it might just be one.\n\n(Source: Natsuyume)",
