    "sinopse": "The description of Suwami Nogami's minimalistic line drawing piece, Imagination Practice, calls it an unending \"thought loop\". It depicts an artist sitting in front of a window with a self-portrait, like a miniature mirror image, on the desk in front of him. The window frame and the blue sky filled with moving clouds are in colour, but the figure of the artist is not coloured in. The soundtrack sounds like a skipping record that is punctuated by humourous springing noises (a la Bugs Bunny) as the image 'bounces' in an unending loop from the establishing shot into the \"drawing.\" A philosophical piece, Imagination Practice considers the circular dialogue between an artist and his work.\n\n(Source: Midnight Eye)",
