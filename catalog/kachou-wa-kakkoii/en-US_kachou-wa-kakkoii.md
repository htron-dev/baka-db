## Sinopse

More than with women, he is more affectionate with the male employees. Even with a bad personality, Manager Sakaki who only has his looks has taken a liking to the new employee, Takemoto. He especially can’t take his eyes off his butt. Drunk, without thinking, he attacked him while he was sleeping?! After much trouble, they end up going out, but they end up in a dispute over who’s top or who’s bottom! Here comes the love comedy with the problematic adults.
