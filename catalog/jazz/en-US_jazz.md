## Sinopse

Can a doctor and his patient ever find romance? Wait patiently, because this is one checkup you won't want to miss! Narusawa and Naoki have way-overstepped the bounds of their doctor-patient relationship. Naoki is instantly attracted to Narusawa, and will stop at nothing to be together with him. One glance into Naoki's despaired eyes and Narusawa caves instantly for Naoki's advances. Will this relationship go beyond a simple fling?
