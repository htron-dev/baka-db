    "sinopse": "Easygoing and playful Shuuji Tanihara has been on his best behavior lately: between his old-fashioned shop that sells cheap candies, toys, and the like, and taking care of his ex-wife's young daughter as a single man, he has had neither the time nor the inclination to pursue anything even remotely adventurous. So when Takafumi Saji—the new pediatrician in town with a serious disposition that could scare away his patients—walks into Shuuji's store, the bored shopkeeper immediately laps up the opportunity to kill time by allowing the gay doctor to seduce him. However, Shuuji soon realizes that this was never meant to be just a lighthearted fling, and he slowly begins to deal with his new, unfamiliar feelings for Takafumi.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
