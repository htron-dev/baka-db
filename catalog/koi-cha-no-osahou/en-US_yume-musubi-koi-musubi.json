    "sinopse": "Since Ao was a kid, his neighbor Ryoumei has been attentive to him and acts like an older brother. They have known each other for a long time, and now that Ao is seventeen, despite his weak and puppyish looks, he is pretty strong, straightforward, popular with girls and...lewd. So, is it on a teenage whim that he starts lusting after Ryoumei? And what would Ryoumei do about the sudden change in Ao's behaviour towards him? This is a story about an insistent high school student trying to win a Shinto priest's love.\n\n(source: queen2408)",
