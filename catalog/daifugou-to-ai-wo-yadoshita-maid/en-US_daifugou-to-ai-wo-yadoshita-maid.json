    "sinopse": "Laney, a maid for a stuck-up countess, rushes out into the middle of the street while preoccupied with one of her duties and winds up in front of a car driven by the world-famous, fabulously rich Kassius! For some reason, he seems to develop an interest in her—and he gifts her with a dress to wear at a ball being held that very night. At the ball, the two of them exchange a burning kiss, and she is on the verge of falling captive to his charms when he announces that Laney is going to bear his child! How on earth could Kassius go from Prince Charming to presumptuous lout so quickly?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
