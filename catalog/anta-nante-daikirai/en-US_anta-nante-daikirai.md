## Sinopse

Shizuka is your typical employee who can do work seriously and with accuracy. But he has an opposite side of himself, where his mouth smoothly speaks nothing but affectionate lines. He’s intoxicated by this side of himself that comes out only on the streets at night when he’s in the mood for love. One night, he meets Suzukuni, who has Shizuka’s ideal face and build. For Shizuka, he was just a one-night stand. While Shizuka tries to forget that amazing night, Suzukuni comes into his workplace, introducing himself as the acting president.
