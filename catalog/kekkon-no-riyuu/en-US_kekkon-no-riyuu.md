## Sinopse

Devon had every reason to strike the man at the fashion show, but she was still fired for it. And after all she had done to become a model! Depressed and beaten, she receives an invitation from the patriarch of an enormously wealthy family, one she knows well. Devon's mother had already betrayed the family, so why would they call for her now? Well, it seems the patriarch is determined that Devon should marry his grandson, Ryan, the very same man from the show!
