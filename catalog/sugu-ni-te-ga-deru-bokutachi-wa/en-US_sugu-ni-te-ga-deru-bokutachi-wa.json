    "sinopse": "Speaking of passionate love, Ginkawa who swings at foul balls. The serious, bespectacled Haguri who typically responds to that idiocy by ignoring/yelling at him or quickly striking out at him every day (swinging at fouls). He is angry, surprised, and irritated that Ginkawa is not discouraged... However, sometimes, silly men are controlled by their hearts, and there are moments where they can't swing at that foul... A new author with a rumored excellent reputation gives us an omnibus of awkward school-days love, with an additional chapter which takes them into their futures!\n\n(Source: Jmanga)",
