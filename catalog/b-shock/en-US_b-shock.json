    "sinopse": "\"B-Shock!\" is mostly a screwball romantic comedy, a showcase for Nakano's wry sense of humor that does not often show in her work in \"Young You\". However, \"B-Shock!\" is also a shrewd commentary on the relationship between the upper and working classes. As much as the Japanese pride themselves as being a homogeneous society, there still exists economic \"haves\" and \"have-nots\" as in all industrial societies. What would happen if you force together two people from different social strata who would normally not give each other even a passing glance? (Source: Manga-Sketchbook)",
