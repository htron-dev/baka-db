    "sinopse": "Tsuruta is the head of the art club at her school, but she's not a very good artist. The boy she has a huge crush on, an underclassman named Seto, is both handsome and talented in art! Tsuruta, who has a vivid imagination and a raging teenage libido, can't help being constantly distracted by vivid sexual daydreams. They don't stop at night, either, so Tsuruta is constantly sleep-deprived! Tsuruta is determined to improve her art skills, be a good club leader, and possibly get some attention from Seto in reality!\n\n(Source: MU)",
