    "sinopse": "Everyone's afraid of Koguma—the biggest, most intimidating guy at school. So when Shinobu accidentally spills milk on his bag, you can bet she's pretty scared about what's going to happen next. It turns out that the bag contains an antique kimono, of all things. It belongs to Koguma's grandmother, who runs a kimono shop. To make up for ruining the outfit, Shinobu's going to have to start modeling kimonos as part of grandma's big plan to market her products to younger customers. Big, scary Koguma's into kimonos? Turns out there's a lot no one knew about this tall, quiet boy, and now Shinobu's out to change that. But in doing so, will she also end up with a new boyfriend?\n\n(Source: CMX)",
