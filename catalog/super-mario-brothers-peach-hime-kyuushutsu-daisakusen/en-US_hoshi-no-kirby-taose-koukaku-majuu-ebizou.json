    "sinopse": "Special 3-D animated short based on Kirby: Right Back at Ya!. It was released on the Wii channel in Japan. It features the never-before-seen monster named Lobzilla. Fire Kirby makes a special appearance, as does a new Kirby ability exclusive to the short called Kabuki. Seeing that Nightmare Enterprises is active and Dedede's transporter is operative, this episode may have taken place before episodes 96-100.\n\n(Source: Kirby Wikia)",
