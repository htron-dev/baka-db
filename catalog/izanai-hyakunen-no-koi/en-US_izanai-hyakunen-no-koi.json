But when their one-time tryst turns into a torrid affair, Sevi's feelings come rushing to the surface. Can a human truly care for a creature of the night? Izanai: Hyakunen no Koi follows gorgeous vampires as they frolic and feed without restraint! No mortal or monster can predict the instant when their pulse will race at the sight of a brand-new mate…but when the end is imminent, is it worth it to fall in love?\n\n(Source: Digital Manga, Inc.)",
