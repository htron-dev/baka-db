    "sinopse": "The four girls of the Kameido High School tennis club play and don't play tennis in their side-splittingly funny daily lives. The new club member, Yuri Oshimoto, is forced to be the straightman to her idiotic upperclassmen. Then, there's Kanae Shinjou, the stupidity-machine who can't play tennis even though she's in the tennis club; Marimo Bandou, the unpredictable super-pervert from Kansai; and Nasuno Takamiya, the air-headed, mysterious rich girl who tries to solve everything with money. Today, tomorrow, and the day after, regardless if they're all there or not, it's a tennis manga you can't help but roar in laughter at?!\n\n(Source: JManga)",
