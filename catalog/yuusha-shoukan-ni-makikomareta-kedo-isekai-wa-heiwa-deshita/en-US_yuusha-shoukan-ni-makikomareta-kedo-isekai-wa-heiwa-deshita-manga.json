    "sinopse": "Suddenly appearing in a different world, it looks like I got caught up in a hero summoning. And of course, I'm not the hero, but it's another guy... and while being very cautious and scared of the cliché-like development, I was thrown into the maelstrom of war... or not.\n\nThe Demon Lord? It was defeated a thousand years ago. Hero? He's just the main actor in a festival. Nobles? They're kindly taking care of us. The demon race? They have good relationships with humans. Wars? It's already 800 years since the last one. Monsters? The Guild and Order of Knight are taking care of them. Return to Earth? It is essentially no-risk.\n\nWhat I'm planning after being caught up into this? I'm gonna enjoy the life in a different world as much as I want to, go on a cultural exchange and sightseeing, and after experiencing the festival that is only held once every ten years... I shall go home safely.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
