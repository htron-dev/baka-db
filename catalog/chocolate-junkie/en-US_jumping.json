In an effort to change herself, she takes her only friend up on her offer to share a room in Aomori, where to her great pleasure, they have a riding club. Oizumi has always wanted to ride horses like her cousin Sou-chan, but never had the nerve to join a club, but that will change when she comes across Tsugaru, a horse that does not want to let others ride it.",
