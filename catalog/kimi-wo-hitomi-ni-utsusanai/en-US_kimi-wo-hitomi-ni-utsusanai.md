## Sinopse

After graduating from a university in Tokyo, Chiharu returns to his family home, a hot spring inn. As the only son, it is his destiny to become the heir of the inn, but being bad at communication makes it difficult for him to fulfil the responsibility. One day, he encounters a famous college judo player named Sonoda, who comes to stay at the inn for rehabilitation. Sonoda is a polite man, and he doesn't look down on Chiharu for being bad at communication. Chiharu feels at ease around Sonoda, until one day Sonoda asks him, "Do you like men?" What should Chiharu answer to that?!
