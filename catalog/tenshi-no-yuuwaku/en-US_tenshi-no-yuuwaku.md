## Sinopse

Is he an angel... or a devil? Baron Ciel Angelucci will grant your wish - at a price.

When one hapless antiques dealer breaks the Baron's seal, he is once more free to roam both time and space, bending reality to his will, finding lovers in women as well as men.

Every wish comes at a price, and more often than not it's a gruesome one. In a gripping mix of horror and beauty, Milk Morizono & Yuria Watanabe brings you four dark and sensual tales of the Baron.
