## Sinopse

Miko leaves the house of her parents to live in the house of her uncle who runs a shared house, but her first meeting with Matsunaga-san is not good and then discovers that he is one of her uncle's tenants. Even as a secondary student, she surrounds herself with university students who have a very different life from her own. Can she fit in that shared house?
