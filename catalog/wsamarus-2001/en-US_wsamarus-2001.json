    "sinopse": "This is a collection of bizarre images, shorts, and short stories. One of the most notable stories involves a young girl whose sick-seeming friend insists that she be taken to the ocean. Without asking any questions, she enlists the help of a random passing driver to fulfill her friend's strange wish. The reason for it will end up being stranger than she could have guessed! Another story involves a young girl whose older sister has an illness that has left her asleep for 8 years. One day, her older sister wakes up, and the two share their first real day together.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
