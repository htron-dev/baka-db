Suzaku has been hogging up all of the girls in town, leaving Hotei hungry and desperate. One day, a human boy gives Hotei a piece of candy. Although there is a danger he’ll have a bad reaction, Hotei eats it, and turns into a young boy! Knowing that Suzaku prefers young boys, Hotei decides to use his appearance to leech off of Suzaku and have revenge. But with a turn of events, Hotei finds himself at the receiving end of his prank!\n(from B-U)",
