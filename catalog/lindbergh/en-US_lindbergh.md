## Sinopse

Eldura is a country surrounded by high walls; flying is forbidden, and is generally considered a crime.

Knit is a spirited little boy whose life's dream is soaring across the beautiful blue sky he admires every day. Then he meets a strange creature who just might be the ways and means to make his dream come true... but he'll need a lot of courage—and a good deal of help—to achieve this wish.
