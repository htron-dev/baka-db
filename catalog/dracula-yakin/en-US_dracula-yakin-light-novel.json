    "sinopse": "Vampires are creatures that turn to ash if they are exposed to the light of the sun. Although they can only move around at night, but they have actually been able to live quite comfortably in modern times.\n\nWhy is that, you ask? That's because there exists the concept of a \"night shift.\"\n\nToraki Yura is a vampire who lives in the modern age. He works at a convenience store in Ikebukuro (night shift only), and lives in a semi-basement apartment that gets next to no sunlight (blackout curtains are a necessity). For the sake of going back to being human, he lives his life on the straight and narrow everyday.\n\nHowever, after saving a blond-haired beauty from a drunkard, he finds out that she is Sister Iris, a nun who found her calling in exterminating vampires! Moreover, his natural enemy ended up as an unwanted guest in his apartment!? What is going to happen to Toraki's peaceful vampire life!?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
