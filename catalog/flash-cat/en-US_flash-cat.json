    "sinopse": "Amyoung Doe and Padam Ma have always been cited as the misohnyun (handsome guy(s)) of their High School, but for some reason, they've been rivals for almost forever. Suddenly, Amyoung's mother and Padam's father marry and go off on an extended vacation, forcing them to live together at Padam's house. Then one day, Padam's father calls and tells them his deceased friend's daughter, Sihtah Ah, is coming from India to live with them. As their parents are absent, Padam and Amyoung deal with Sihtah, who seems to have a strange feline curse, and eventually, Madi Park and her friend Heesook move into the home. As Amyoung and Padam deal with each other and their quirky new guests, odd circumstances and strange cats appear.\n\n(Source: MangaUpdates)",
