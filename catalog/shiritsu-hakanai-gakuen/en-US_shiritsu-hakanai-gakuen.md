## Sinopse

The female student body is left in confusion and disarray as the new student council president has just banned all underpants. The ordinance extends to males and females alike, but of course, it's less of a bother for men since they have more to wear than a cloth wrapped around their waist. Read what happens to the girls of this school as skirts fly!
