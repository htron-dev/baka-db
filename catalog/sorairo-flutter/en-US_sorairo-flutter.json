    "sinopse": "Outgoing high school student Noshiro finds himself drawn to Sanada, the school outcast, who is rumored to be gay. Rather than deter Noshiro, the rumor makes him even more determined to get close to Sanada, setting in motion a bittersweet tale of first love.\n\nWhen Noshiro transfers to a new school, he meets Sanada, a loner who doesn't seem to have friends—or want any. The other kids whisper that Sanada keeps to himself because he's secretly a gay. But rather than scare Noshiro away, the rumor only makes him more interested. He sets out on a campaign to win over the surly Sanada, embarking on a surprising friendship.\n\nA butterflies-in-your-stomach high school romance about two very different high school boys who find themselves unexpectedly falling for each other.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
