    "sinopse": "Tachibana is a hapless system engineer who has never had a girlfriend. One day, he was forcibly taken by a female boss to Club Naked, a strip club where men take off their clothes. Among them, the number one dancer Leo caught his eye. Tachibana falls in love with Leo's powerful dancing, stimulating outfit, and his beautiful physical body! To think that the day would come where he was captivated by a naked man! Before he knew it, he was going there every week?!\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)",
