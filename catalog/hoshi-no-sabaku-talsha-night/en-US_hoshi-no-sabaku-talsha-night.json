    "sinopse": "Mana and Kenji, twin sister and brother, found a star as little children. On a far off world, their star is called the Talshas, meaning 'Stone of Wind and Gods', and it will grant the wishes of one person for as long as they live. And though it has lain quiet for 10 years, that is swiftly changing. The twins' lives are rocked by tragedies and miracles, chance meetings that are not as innocent as they seem, and trust forged and broken as a war between two distant planets descends around them. And ultimately, the only real wishes are the ones made for the sake of another.\n\n(Source: MU)",
