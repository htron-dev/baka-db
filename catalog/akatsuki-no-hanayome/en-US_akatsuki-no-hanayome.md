## Sinopse

How can a heartless man be so kind and passionate?

After her parents died, Tara was able to continue only because of her little sister, Charlene. And then, a year ago, she lost Charlene, too. She was murdered by the coldhearted Gavin Deveroux. And what's harder to believe is that, according to witnesses and her sister's diary, he's a vampire! Though she has her doubts, Tara finally confirms the truth at her sister's memorial service when the man himself shows up. No human could possibly be as beautiful as this man, and in that moment Tara completely forgot about her plan for revenge!
