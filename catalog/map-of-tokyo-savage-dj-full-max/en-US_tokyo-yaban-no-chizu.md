## Sinopse

When Takashi Shinohara, aka "Devourer of Evil Spirits", and his intriguing associates of exorcists rescue a young boy from possession, they face more than they bargained for. Takashi's haunted past surfaces by way of a rather perverse organization of fellow exorcists with an agenda all their own. Are a simple minded incubus, a seemingly mild-mannered teahouse owner, and a man with "no name" and a mysterious past enough to help Takashi face his foes and even himself?
