    "sinopse": "When Takashi Shinohara, aka \"Devourer of Evil Spirits\", and his intriguing associates of exorcists rescue a young boy from possession, they face more than they bargained for. Takashi's haunted past surfaces by way of a rather perverse organization of fellow exorcists with an agenda all their own. Are a simple minded incubus, a seemingly mild-mannered teahouse owner, and a man with \"no name\" and a mysterious past enough to help Takashi face his foes and even himself?\n\n(Source: Dr. Ten Translation Project)",
