    "sinopse": "Tomoe Kuchiba has been sent by his Father to honour the long-held tradition of protecting the head of the Mitsugi clan. Mamoru Mitsugi proves to be anything but receptive to this offer -- what with running a Host Club where all the girls are really boys, who has time for such old fashioned nonsense? And why would Mamoru require protection? Mamoru is, however, anything but what he appears -- much like those he surrounds himself with such as Takashi Shinohara, Nananshi, Katsuragi, and Konome from Dr. Ten's prequel \"Map of Tokyo Savage\". Mamoru is not going to make Tomoe's job easy at all! Mind, he never makes life easy for anyone including himself!\n\n(Source: Dr. Ten Translation Project)",
