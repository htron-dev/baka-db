    "sinopse": "Demetri Kastro has dark suspicions about Joanna, the young and very attractive woman who has escorted his father home to Greece. Though the elderly millionaire is ill, Demetri is certain Joanna isn't what the doctor ordered!\n\nHowever, Demetri's attempts to dig beneath Joanna's coolly beautiful exterior reveal few clues as to the nature of her relationship with his father. She's giving nothing away... except an unwitting sexual attractiveness that Demetri finds hard to resist...\n\n(Source: MU)",
