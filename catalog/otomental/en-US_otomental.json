But of course, finding love isn't going to be easy, especially if you have three delinquent boys who are your childhood friends. Otome explains to the boys that since they are in high school now, she wants to find love and fall deeply in love, but Tokio (one of her childhood friends) insist that she be part of his plan. He dreams of taking over the school and becoming a grand gang leader; he'll even let her join as the sub-leader. What is she going to do? As she sneaks away from the boys, she catches a couple of girls watching the most popular boy, Touyou, being confessed to!? Is this love at first sight? She decides to spy/stalk him...what will she find out?\n\n(Source: whyanime)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nTonari no Danshi (The Boy Next Door)\nChitsujo vs. Jiyuu: Saint Jiyuu Gakuin (System vs. Freedom: St. Liberty Academy)",
