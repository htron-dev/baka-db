## Sinopse

Every three hundred years, the Evil God's awakening foretells destruction and despair. To prevent this from happening, heroes known as the Braves of the Six Flowers are chosen by the Spirit of Fate, and marked with a crest as the saviors of the world. No matter what, there are always six heroes—but this time when the chosen convene, seven arrive.

Adlet Mayer, self-proclaimed "strongest man in the world," is one of the seven Braves. Among others, there is also first princess Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra, loyal knight Goldov Auora, feline-esque assassin Hans Humpty, childish yet deadly Chamo Rosso, the stern Mora Chester, and loner Fremy Speeddraw. Though all are likely candidates for being Braves, there is only one explanation for the extra hero—the seventh is an infiltrator attempting to sabotage their mission and tear apart the Braves from within.

With all evidence pointing to him, Adlet becomes the prime suspect, and finds himself on the run, desperately attempting to prove his own innocence. But as the clock continues to tick down, and as the Braves turn on each other, the Evil God's minions restlessly await its return.
