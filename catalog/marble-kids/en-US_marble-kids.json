    "sinopse": "Kisaragi Moka is in Grade 10 at Kouyou High. She’s also the captain of the cheerleading team and a dancer. When she was younger, she used to be very shy and would never show off when dancing. During shows and competitions, she would always stay in the back because she had no confidence. Then one day, someone showed her a photo of herself in a magazine dancing, and she looked wonderful. Becuase of that she found courage and decided to dance for other people to give them courage(this is why she cheerleads). She doesn’t know exactly who took the picture, but his name is Ryo. She keeps the picture with her all the time in a small bag. She wants to find Ryo because she thinks he must be a splendid person",
