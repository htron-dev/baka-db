    "sinopse": "Rui lacks the feminine features needed as a hostess, so she instead dresses up as a guy to go earn some fast money as a host. Her friend Sera had told her to not leave the place with clients, but before she realized it, she was taken to a hotel. While trying to get away from the client, Touma buys her for one million dollars, chasing away the client. But, Rui's not quite free to go yet. What will Touma do with the Rui now that he has bought her?\n\n(Source: MU)",
