## Sinopse

Quart Franagan is a spirit medium, although unfortunately he's not the best. His medium house has lasted for generations, but he only has a quarter of their ability—the only spirits he can call are animals, and while his touch can feel the spirits, he can't even hear them.
For that, he needs help from his feline sidekick, although he can only be called half a cat, as he has the past life memories of a dog.
Together they aid the animals they encounter, helping them find perspective by exploring their pasts.
