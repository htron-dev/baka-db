## Sinopse

Horiuchi Yutaka-san is a popular idol, who isn't as glamorous and happy as her fans may think. Naturally, her next steps include a radio show, but one she isn't all too keen on doing. Although she tries her best to keep up her image, things quickly turn for a worse. As she soon finds out, her voice is not hers alone.
