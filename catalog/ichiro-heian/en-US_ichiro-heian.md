## Sinopse

A 18-year old-Japanese otaku from Tokyo runs into a cute and lost Chinese cyclist. He offers her to lead the way, and she gladly accepts. But what happens when her destination turns out to be Kyoto instead of the sports stadium he thought of? Will the Chinese he learned from anime be enough to communicate, and moreover where will this unexpected journey lead them to?
