## Sinopse

The huge labyrinth city, Orario, is the gateway to the huge underground maze commonly known as the "Dungeon." Its strange name causes excitement, a place to gain honor, and maybe even a romance with a pretty girl. A place where people hold their breath, hoping to gain all they wish for, a place where a solitary young man meets a little "god."

"Alright, Bell-kun, follow me! It's time for the "Familia" initiation rite to happen!"
"Yes! I'm going to get stronger!"

The fated meeting of a boy who wants to become an adventurer, and the failed god who doesn't even have a single follower.

This boy's journey as written by the goddess, "Familia Myth."
