    "sinopse": "The huge labyrinth city, Orario, is the gateway to the huge underground maze commonly known as the \"Dungeon.\" Its strange name causes excitement, a place to gain honor, and maybe even a romance with a pretty girl. A place where people hold their breath, hoping to gain all they wish for, a place where a solitary young man meets a little \"god\"...\n\nThe fated meeting of a boy who wants to become an adventurer, and the failed god who doesn't even have a single follower.\n\n(Source: Baka-Tsuki)",
