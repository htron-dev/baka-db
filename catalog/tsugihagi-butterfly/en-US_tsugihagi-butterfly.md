## Sinopse

"It's full of patches, this world..."

Tokyo, Shinjuku, where a large scale infectious syndrome has spread. The population lived their lives as if they forgot about such an event. However, that something that isn't quite human, really does exist. Set in a town where a large amount of depression, hope and desire intersect, a boy with multiple personalities, a host who is set on getting a girlfriend, a trouble shooter with the motto: "Swift death to evil," and an extraordinary girl who wishes for ordinary happiness, together they weave a jet coaster like story!
