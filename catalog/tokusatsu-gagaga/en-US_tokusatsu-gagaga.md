## Sinopse

Nakamura Kano is an office lady with a secret... she's a "TokuOta," a tokusatsu otaku, who is obsessed with live action dramas of heroes, monsters and robots. She lives her life by the code of the tokusatsu heroes, and constantly imagines them to help her through difficult situations. But this isn't easy when all of her co-workers think that people who like anime and other childish things are weird, and they keep trying to make her socialize.
