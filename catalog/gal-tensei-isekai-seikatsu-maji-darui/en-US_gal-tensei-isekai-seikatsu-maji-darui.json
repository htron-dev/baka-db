    "sinopse": "On a typical day, a speeding truck hits a trio of gyarus, promptly transporting them into an alternate world. Now, the short-tempered Rinka Tachibana, the crazed-looking Kokoa Haseba, and the smart Maki Makita are stranded in a different realm with only their attitudes and mobile phones at their disposal.\n\nWith no evident escape from this place, they decide to remain and make the best out of their situation. Being somewhat slow, they soon realize their biggest problem: their money is worthless in this world. Even though the girls thought their homeworld was boring, they will have to work tirelessly to stay alive here.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
