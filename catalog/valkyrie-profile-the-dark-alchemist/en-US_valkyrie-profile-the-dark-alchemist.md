## Sinopse

Humans are suited to be come a warrior of the Gods world. Once proven to be the holder of an honourable soul, a Goddess - The Warrior Virgin - will lead and show those the way into the Gods world, and yet dead, their souls will be given the opportunity to walk down the path of life. Necromancer, Lezard Valeth and his young apprentice Louie meet a "Hero" from a small town. Is he perhaps one of these honourable souls and what interest does Lezard have in him? (Source: Boku-Tachi)
