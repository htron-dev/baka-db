## Sinopse

On the planet Earth, its been 60 years since a destructive meteor impact. Since then, the surface of the planet is occupied by people known as the Eidrons who are capable of controlling powerful mechas known as Shadows. These Shadows are dangerous entities that are capable of easily causing destruction and wrecking havoc.

The protagonist of this story is Lifa, a 14 year old girl who has lost her memory in their family restaurant but has recorded works. After the incident in which a Shadow attacked a plane which led to its destruction, as well as the demise of all the passengers onboard, Lifa ended up as the primary suspect. For that matter, both the US government and a secret organization had placed poor Lifa on their blacklist and are hunting her down. At first, Lifa was totally hopeless of surviving the dangers but luckily, some mysterious ladies appear to the rescue.
