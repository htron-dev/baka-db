## Sinopse

Moriguchi Orito is transferring to a new school, but being lost in the fog he can't find his way to it and end up bumping into a beautiful girl and got struck by a vision of her in a very sexy pose. Seeing him with his cellphone in his hand, she thinks he took a picture of her and runs away crying, "My life has ended!", dropping her own cellphone in the process. Finally finding his way to the school, he realizes that it's full of very weird people, and that his new seat is next to an empty desk where a bag is hanging with the same strap as the one on the cellphone the beautiful girl dropped...
