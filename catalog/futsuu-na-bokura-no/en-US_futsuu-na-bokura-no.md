## Sinopse

Tsubaki is a young girl who leaves Tokyo and moves to the seaside. Before classes begin, she recovers a lost scarf and a beautifully written letter that belongs to a young boy. She falls in love at first sight when she reads this letter and decides to try to find this boy at all costs.

She soon discovers that he is in the same school as her, that his name is Ibuki and that he is a year older. Believing it's destiny, she tries to get closer to him but it turns out that he is hiding a secret...
