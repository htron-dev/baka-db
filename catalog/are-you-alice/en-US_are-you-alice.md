## Sinopse

A disillusioned young man in search of "something" stumbles into the weird and wacky world of Wonderland, where, as "Alice," he is thrust into a murderous game of "Kill the White Rabbit" by command of the ruler of the land, the Queen of Hearts. But while Alice rails against the role that has been forced upon him, he has little choice but to comply. For in Wonderland, not sticking to the script can have deadly consequences...
