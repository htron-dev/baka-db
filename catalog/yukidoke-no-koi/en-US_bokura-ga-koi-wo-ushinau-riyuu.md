“If you’re okay with me, you can use me.” Oushirou has held years of unrequited feelings for his childhood friend Koba. One day, he’s drinking in a bar, when a man named Inamura chats him up. He’s suspicious by Inamura’s loose personality, but suffering from his unrequited love, Oushirou looks to his kind and easy-going hands for help. A bittersweet love triangle between a mysterious, kind man, and his childhood friend.
