Marika Fujisawa is a crazy plant lady who is deeply passionate about anything green and growing. While training to become a plant coordinator, Marika is hired by "HEAVEN," a prestigious plant rental service dedicated to high quality decorative vegetation for special events. There, she meets stern Tetsuya. At first he seems dull, but then Marika comes across his rose arrangements and wonders how such a blunt man can create such heavenly decorations... On top of that, Marika has to stay on top of work! How will a wedding turn out under her expertise?
