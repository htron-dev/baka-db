## Sinopse

Sangbum, a misogynistic, germophobic plastic surgeon, is shocked to discover that the sperm he donated as a medical student has resulted in a 13-year-old daughter, Myunghae. Myunghae's foster parents were killed in an accident, so she gets unceremoniously dropped into her biological dad's life. Sangbum isn't prepared for the responsibilities of fatherhood, but he quickly comes to love the daughter who looks so much like him.
While she adjusts to her happy new life with Sangbum, however, Myunghae is shocked to learn that her boyfriend is now dating her best friend. And then she has to contend with the attentions of Bokit, one of the popular kids at school...
