## Sinopse

Chieko owns a doll that is very precious to her. When her friend Hatsuko dies, Chieko’s parents decide to offer the doll to Hatsuko and to bury her with it, so she won’t feel alone during the travel to the kingdom of death. But Chieko doesn’t want to give doll and decides to hide it.
Years have passed and Chieko has become a mother herself. She finds the doll during moving her stuff. From that point on, strange events occur in the house, as if the doll was haunted…
