## Sinopse

Meguri comes from a poor family with many children. She longed for a place where she can call her own. Her meeting with Shingen, a heir monk of a temple who's being urged by his mother to get married soon, probably gave that chance. Falling for Shingen's charisma, the two got married, so it's probably happy ever after...
