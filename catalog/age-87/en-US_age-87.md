## Sinopse

At 48 years old, Eiji Sugurono has enjoyed a long and successful career as a mangaka. However, recently he's been having a recurring nightmare that about a girl from his time in high school, though his memory of her seems to be repressed. One day, after getting hit by a car, he finds himself back in high school, 31 years in the past! He soon realizes that the girl is Meguru Tokisaka, his classmate and soon-to-be girlfriend, and his memories of her were repressed after her untimely death. While he doesn't know when, where, or why it happened, Eiji will do everything to save her with the second chance he's been given.
