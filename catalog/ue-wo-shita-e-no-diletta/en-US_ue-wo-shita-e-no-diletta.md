## Sinopse

After a television producer tried to kill Otohiko Yamabe by pushing him off the top of a building, the latter, a cartoonist, acquires a superpower. This power, called the 'Diletta', consists in his being able to share his crazy hallucinations with the people around him. The artist thus builds a huge transmitter to share his thoughts, creating a new medium, far more powerful than television.
