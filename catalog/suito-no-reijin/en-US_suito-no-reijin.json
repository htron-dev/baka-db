    "sinopse": "The age of the Inquisition was terrifying for many. Despite being the daughter of the duke's doctor, Jessica is an accomplished healer in her own right, and yet must keep her face hidden from society. Cursed with a birthmark under her left eye, she's perceived by the wary populace as a spawn of the devil. When the future Earl of Thornbury, Francis Bardolph, comes to Jessica to treat an old wound, he may end up healing her fear of the world and her father. With a jealous courtesan angling for a brighter future, will Jessica be forced to stay in the shadows, or can she dance with Francis at the carnival?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
