## Sinopse

On a hot summer afternoon, Hayato meets the new transfer student name Souma, who has not been able to adapt to the new environment. Hayato always manages to be in Souma's sight, and thinks he will be able to take care of him. The familiar touch allows Souma to familiarize with the environment, until he's able to smile once more. All the while Hayato tries to fix things from his past.
