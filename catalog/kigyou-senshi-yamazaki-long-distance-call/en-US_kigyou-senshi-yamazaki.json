To boost their sales and improve their marketing scheme, they sometimes hire a professional consultant to help them.\n\nNeo=System is a company that proves resourceful staff for just that kind of situation, and Yamazaki is their go-to-guy. Most people never realise who he really is; they just think he is some old guy who gets hired to work with them.\n\nYamazaki, however, is more than a human. When facing his unusual opponents, his working ethic, business philosophy and analytical skills combined don't only help him solve business problems. They also help him touch people's lives, inspiring them to live and work in a tough world.",
