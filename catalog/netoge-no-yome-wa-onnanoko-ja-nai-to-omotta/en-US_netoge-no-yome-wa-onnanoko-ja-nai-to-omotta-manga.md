## Sinopse

Hideki Nishimura has sworn never to trust or pursue any girl he meets online after realizing that his in-game crush Nekohime, whom he had proposed to, was in fact a middle-aged man. Two years later, a girl named Ako Tamaki, also a member of the guild Alley Cats, proposes to him through the very same game but he refuses to accept that Ako is a girl in real life, despite her repeated assurance.

Their guild master, Apricot, reveals that he is also a girl and proposes an offline get-together, inviting the two of them and the other male member, Schwein, to meet in real life. Unaware of what to expect, he agrees to go. To Hideki's astonishment, he learns that his fellow guild members are genuine girls, and that they are all enrolled in the same high school. Ako, however, never attends school, playing video games all day instead. In an effort to get her to go to school and raise her grades, they establish a gaming club. Thus, the Alley Cats begin their adventure in the offline world!
