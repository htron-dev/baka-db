## Sinopse

By some ill fortune, Hikaru died in a traffic accident. He was in heaven standing in line, waiting to be judged, when he ended up being convinced to transfer his soul to a person in another world. He received an ability called Soul Board which he could use to allocate points to Skills to make himself more powerful. But there was a catch...

"You must kill a certain person within one hour. If you don't, your soul will be destroyed."

To pull off the absurd task assigned to him, he poured all his available points to the Stealth skill tree. This is a story of a boy who specialized in Stealth. With his skill trees as weapons, he would demonstrate his unrivaled strength in another world.
