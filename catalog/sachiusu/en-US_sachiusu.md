## Sinopse

Mukai Sachi is extremely unlucky. Stubbed toes, lost items, bird poop... it all happens to her. Her most unfortunate problem, though, is Gokurakuin Misako, the only member of the Occult Research Society. Misako is an honors student, beautiful, very strange, and friendless. She is interested in Sachi's "power" because she wants strange, unexplainable things to happen to herself, too. The problem is that Sachi has absolutely no interest in the occult, so Misako's continued, oddball attempts to get her to join the Occult Research Society are yet another piece of bad luck for Sachi!
