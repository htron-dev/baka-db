## Sinopse

Sakuraba Junko is an English teacher at an English Language School in Tokyo. Her dream is to live a fancy and dramatic life abroad, but the reality is that she is 27 years old and still single. Her family forces her into an omiai with Hoshikawa Takane, but Hoshikawa turns out to be a monk at a Buddhist temple, who fully expects his future wife to quit any outside jobs and lead a quiet, proper life, becoming of a monk's wife. Junko is horrified and refuses immediately, but it seems he is not one to back down so easily...
