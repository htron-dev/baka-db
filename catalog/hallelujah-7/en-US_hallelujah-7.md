Since the death of her grandmother, Makoto has gone to live with her father, but not even a few days had passed before he left her a note saying that he was going on a long work-related trip and that he had asked his friends the Sengoku family to take care of her. When she gets to the Sengoku house, however, she meets some extremely interesting characters. What are their secrets and what is the secret behind her father's sudden trip? Fujita Maki weaves together a supernatural themed human drama in this short series.
