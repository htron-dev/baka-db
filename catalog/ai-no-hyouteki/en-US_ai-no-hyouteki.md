## Sinopse

Because of his father’s job transfer, Sakura had to transfer schools. The person who was waiting there was someone who holds the title student president, a huge sadist “demon”! From the moment they met, Sakura had been locked on as his target of love, having his body stolen, rudely stole him entirely. On top of that, the demon Masaomi’s father is the president of Sakura’s father’s job… in other words there is no escape!!!
