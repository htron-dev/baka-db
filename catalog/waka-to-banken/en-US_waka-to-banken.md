## Sinopse

In a chance moment, the yakuza Takeomi happens to save a young man being attacked, who turns out to be the son of the kumichou, Seiya. Since men keep coming after him, charmed by his ethereal beauty, the kumichou had forced Seiya to stay locked away. Ever since that day, Seiya has become Takeomi’s responsibility. At the same time, the sudden death of the kumichou leaves Seiya to take up the job in his place?!
