    "sinopse": "Many Shonen Jump characters have big dreams, but this character's big dream is a nightmare! A very realistic reoccurring nightmare where a giant monster destroys a city. And it always ends with Kou, the poor dreamer, getting crushed under the rubble. But when Kou meets an unusual man who somehow knows about the monster in his dream, his nightmare takes on a whole new meaning.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
