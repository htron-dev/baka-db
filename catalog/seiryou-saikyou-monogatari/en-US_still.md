## Sinopse

It's been eight years since Ishida and Yano shared a very awkward moment during their graduation from Seiryou High.

After college, Ishida hadn't seen or heard from his best friend for over three years. One day, he briefly glimpses Yano on a passing train. When did he come back and why do his friends insist it couldn't possibly be Yano? Ishida begins a desperate search for his missing friend with the old Student Council in tow.
(From Blissful Sin)
