## Sinopse

In college, Kuze secretly harbored feelings for his adjunct law lecturer, Kitahara. However, knowing that Kitahara was married, Kuze sealed away those emotions.

Seven years later, by bizarre coincidence Kuze finds himself working as Kitahara's assistant. What's more, Kitahara is no longer wearing his wedding ring.

Unrequited love might be romantic, but the real deal is always better. (Source: DramaQueen)
