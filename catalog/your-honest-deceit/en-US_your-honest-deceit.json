    "sinopse": "In college, Kuze secretly harbored feelings for his adjunct law lecturer, Kitahara. However, knowing that Kitahara was married, Kuze sealed away those emotions.\n\nSeven years later, by bizarre coincidence Kuze finds himself working as Kitahara's assistant. What's more, Kitahara is no longer wearing his wedding ring.\n\nUnrequited love might be romantic, but the real deal is always better. (Source: DramaQueen)",
