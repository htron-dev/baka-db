## Sinopse

Yuzu was afraid she'd be completely on her own after her mother died… but when she finds out she's not, she doesn't know whether to be relieved or annoyed! A sudden meeting with her long-lost grandmother reveals her status as heiress to a wealthy estate, but Yuzu isn't at all sure she wants anything to do with it.
