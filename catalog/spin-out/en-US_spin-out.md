## Sinopse

Endlessly frustrated by his position as a babysitter for sweet but useless young master Ryouma, Tatsumi vents his stress on Miki, a nail artist who enjoys rough sex. Initially attracted by Miki's resemblance to the young master, Tatsumi becomes confused when it's Miki himself he can’t stop thinking about.
