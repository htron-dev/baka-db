## Sinopse

Fushigi na Melmo
Melmo's mother dies in a traffic accident, leaving young Melmo and her younger brother Totoo. Anxious Melmo's mother in heaven asks God to prepare some magical candies, and hands them to Melmo. There are two kinds: Melmo can grow 10 years older to become any sort of adult she wishes by eating a blue candy. By eating a red one, she can become 10 years younger. Using these miracle candies, Melmo disguises herself as a nurse, schoolteacher, policewoman, and overcomes troubles together with her brother, Totoo. (Source: MU)

Bouken Rubi
Rubio is a primary school boy. One day, a meteorite from space falls down in Rubio's back yard. Concealed in the meteorite were two helmet-like hats. When Rubio puts on one of the hats, he hears a voice which was apparently that of a space being. The space denizen tells Rubio that it had strange magical powers and that a huge space monster called "Zonda" was aiming to obliterate Earth. The space being urges Rubio to utilize the magical powers of the hat to save Earth from Zonda.

Rubio gives the other hat to his schoolmate, Kuriko, and start out looking for a way and means to annihilate Zonda. The magical hats enabled the two to fly through the skies and also gave them supernatural strength. The two fly throughout the world and solve numerous difficult incidents and then they blast off to space. After a long journey, they finally discover Zonda. (Source: Kodansha)
