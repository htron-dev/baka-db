## Sinopse

It's Kyoto, and yet it is not.

A microcosm of peculiar origins, "Mirror Kyoto."

A small incident causes a young girl, Koto, to wander into this world.

She runs into a mysterious monk, gets chased around by a tech-obsessed girl, and heartily enjoys her chaotic and colorful new life, but meanwhile, out of sight, a certain plan is being set into motion...

In this mysterious city where spirits and humans have been thrown together, the festivities are about to begin!
