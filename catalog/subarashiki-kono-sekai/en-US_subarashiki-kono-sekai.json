    "sinopse": "In the middle of Shibuya's scramble crossing, one boy finds himself able to hear the thoughts of the people around him. Unsure as to why he's there with nothing but a mysterious black badge with a skull on it, Neku Sakuraba is quickly spotted by a girl who demands to make a pact with him, explaining that she requires it to not get \"erased\" by malicious creatures known as the \"Noise.\" After forming the pact, the mysterious girl defeats the Noise and introduces herself as Shiki Misaki, along with her stuffed animal Nyan-tan.\n\nShiki explains that the two of them must join forces for the next seven days, as they are part of the \"Shinigami's Game.\" Much to his dismay, Neku reluctantly goes along as an invisible wall prevents him from leaving Shibuya. Not only will the duo need to protect themselves from the Noise using \"psychs\", abilities gained from badges, but they are also required to clear daily Missions given under certain time limits.\n\nAs he clears the seemingly needless Missions one after another, Neku is left wondering about the true nature of the Shinigami's Game.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
