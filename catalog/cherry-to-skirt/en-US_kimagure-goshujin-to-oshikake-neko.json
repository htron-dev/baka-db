    "sinopse": "Rikuo is a struggling college student who one night finds a person at his front door claiming to be the cat he met at a park weeks ago. Skeptical at first, he tries to ignore the person, but later on, Rikuo cracks and takes in the cat-person in his home and names him \"Tama.\" But it seems that \"Tama\" has a secret of his own. What will happen when Rikuo finds out?\n\n(Source: MediBang/Julian Publishing)",
