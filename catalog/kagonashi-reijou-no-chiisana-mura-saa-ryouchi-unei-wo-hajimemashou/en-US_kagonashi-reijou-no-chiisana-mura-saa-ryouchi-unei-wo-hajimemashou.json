    "sinopse": "I reincarnated as the villainess in a game world—I'm not afraid of banishment, I'll manage my territory and live as I like!\n\nI reincarnated as Celistina, the villainess of an otome game. As the fiancée of the crown prince, in this world where everyone is gifted with blessings by the gods and spirits, I'm the \"young lady without a blessing.\" As a result of being a fan of the game, I know that the crown prince will be with the heroine sooner or later, and he will break our engagement. Alternatively, if they don't end up together, I will be executed...\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
