    "sinopse": "This story is set in (maybe) the Edo period. Kokaku, a samurai usually found wearing a gaudy kimono without a hakama, is a member of a clan. Though lazy, he mercilessly punishes bad guys. This is an action-packed story about a hero who sneaks into gambling parlors and brothels and beats up thugs and bullies.\n\n(Source: Jmanga)",
