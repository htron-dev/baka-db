## Sinopse

Yuuji is a chef in his own brewery, and seems to lead a rather pleasant life there. On the other hand, he still cannot forget the love he had for his childhood friend, Souichi. But while Yuuji has moved away from him to suffer less, Souichi reappears, thinner and exhausted by his work. Listening only to his concern, Yuuji invites him to his brewery. Now that they are adults, wouldn't their relationship take on a different meaning?
