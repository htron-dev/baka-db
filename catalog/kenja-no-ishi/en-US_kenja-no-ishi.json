    "sinopse": "The mysterious alchemist Lorenzo Lusignano, a descendant of the royal family of Cyprus, is searching for the ultimate secret of alchemy—the Philosopher's stone \"Elixir.\" Rumors of this blood-red gem creep everywhere, but nobody seems to have seen it, so Lorenzo's travels through Europe's Renaissance are never easy. Follow him on his journey as he meets kings and queens, witches and wizards, pirates and gypsies, fairy-tale creatures and monsters, and even gods.\n\n(Source: Aerandria)",
