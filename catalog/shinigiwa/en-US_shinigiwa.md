## Sinopse

Toshimori was born with the power to see a person's moment before death. Despite his efforts to save the people around him, he quickly realized that if he were to save someone, another person would die in their place, and his hand would also become deformed for a while.

As everyone started avoiding him because of various incidents that occur to people around him, a girl approached him without fear. Feeling an attachment to the girl, he now struggles to keep the girl alive with his power.
