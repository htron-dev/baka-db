    "sinopse": "\"How can you call someone insane if they're not even arbitrarily murdering other people?\" she said while holding a bar of chocolate in one of her hands.\n\nMayuzumi Azaka, an arrogant, cold hearted, self-willed picky eater is also a fourteen-year-old girl with supernatural powers. Holding her red paper umbrella, dressed in her Gothic Lolita fashion, she smiled at me. A smile that seems to bring me into a deeper despair. And then under a blooming cherry blossom, she spoke to me \"Stay by my side.\"\n\nA cruel and painful, ugly and beautiful mysterious fantasy is about to begin!\n\n(Source: Back cover of the novel)",
