## Sinopse

"I am a Clotaku. That is, it's a portmanteau of 'Closet' and 'Otaku'. We try to appear to be normal people, while secretly keeping up with our Otaku lifestyle. Having overcome a trauma in the past, I, Kang Injin, have been secretly living the Clotaku lifestyle at Eunsung High School, and hoped that my peaceful (?) days would last forever. However, I was found out by Kang Injin. That girl, threatened that if I don't comply with her wish to create the 'Clotaku Club', she would reveal my secret to the school."
