Having overcome a trauma in the past, I, Kang Injin, have been secretly living the Clotaku lifestyle at Eunsung High School, and hoped that my peaceful (?) days would last forever. However, I was found out by Kang Injin. That girl, threatened that if I don't comply with her wish to create the 'Clotaku Club', she would reveal my secret to the school.\"\n\n(Source: Imoutolicious LNT)",
