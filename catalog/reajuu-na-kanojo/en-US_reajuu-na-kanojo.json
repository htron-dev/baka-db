    "sinopse": "Andou Kanna is obsessed with a dating sim mobile game called Special Master-sama Complete. In order to earn money to buy the in-game gacha tickets, she looks for a high-paying part-time job. However... when she answers an ad for a job that pays in gacha tickets, she meets a group of young men who all look just like the characters in the game...?! What's more, the real versions don't act anything like their gallant game counterparts, and are always picking on her! Love in games and in real life... surely it can't be that simple...?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa Gempak Starz)",
