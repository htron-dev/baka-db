    "sinopse": "Akiyama is a salaryman who is stressed, overworked, and tired of everyone at his office expecting him to do their jobs on top of his own just because he's an Alpha. After hours he goes to his usual bar, where his Omega drinking buddy Kasahara listens good-naturedly to his drunken rants. Their relationship changes drastically, however, when Akiyama awakens to find himself half-naked and tied up in the other man's bed, with Kasahara begging him to bite his neck!\n\n(Source: Anime-Planet)",
