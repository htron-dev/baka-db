One night, Tetsu happens to glimpse the man behind the monster, and decides that the man would be the one to teach him the sword and allow him to take his revenge. However, the swordmaster Shino is hardly interested in taking on any students. What will Tetsu have to do to get his revenge, and what happened to Shino in the past to turn him into who he is...?\n\nIncludes: Castilla",
