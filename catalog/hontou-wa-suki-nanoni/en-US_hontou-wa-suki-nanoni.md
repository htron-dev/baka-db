## Sinopse

The two, Natsuki and Naoto, have grown up together since kindergarten. As they grew older, things began to change. Naoto, instead of being a crybaby and a shy child, has become a formidable man, which makes Natsuki feel attracted to him without knowing why. What will happen to the attraction that Natsuki is starting to feel? If Naoto realizes... what would you do...?
