## Sinopse

Mimori Hibiki's goal was to find love, after leaving her backwater town for schooling in Tokyo. However, her grandmother's demand that she use her feminine wiles to lure a groom back to her hometown, combined with a fateful meeting with a young man, has complicated matters. Now she must attempt to juggle emotion and obligation as she attempts to carry out both of these tasks.
