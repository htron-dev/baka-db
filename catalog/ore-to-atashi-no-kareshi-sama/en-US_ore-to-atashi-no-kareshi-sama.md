## Sinopse

Hanamura Chouko, a 16-year old girl, finally summons the courage to tell Tsukiyono her feelings for him. However, her twin brother Hayate (said to be a sis-con) is worried about her because Tsukiyono is very popular among girls. While he's trying to persuade her to keep away from Tsukiyono, they accidentally fall down the stairs and switch bodies.

"I am You, and You are Me? What's going on...?" Give me back my lovey-dovey days with Tsukiyono-kun...!
