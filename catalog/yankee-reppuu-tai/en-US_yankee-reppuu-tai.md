## Sinopse

Impossibly tough and hairsprayed biker boys and girls fight turf wars in the streets, with much revving of motors and "you killed my buddy, prepare to die" dialogue. Based on the Shonen Magazine manga by Masahide Hashimoto, whose hero was so tough that he transferred schools 20 times. Only a Japanese tough guy would continue to go at all!
