    "sinopse": "Ueda Tomoharu is a cop manning a local koban station, and he's quite happy with his job and relatively quiet life until he happens to run into yakuza member Gotouda Aki while chasing down an underwear thief... and is suddenly confessed to! Aki doesn't seem bothered in the least about their \"star-crossed lovers\" status and eagerly dives into a super lovey-dovey relationship with his policeman, but Ueda's about to find out just how dangerous it can be dating a mobster... in more ways than one.\n\n(Source: MU)",
