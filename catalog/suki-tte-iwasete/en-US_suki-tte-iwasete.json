We study at the same university and share an apartment, although I do not pay the rent... I live under the same roof, but... I am in trouble! I'm happy, but I find it problematic... The excitement of living with the person I love. I have to add that his older brother, Hidekazu, falls for a tsundere at first sight.\n\n(Source: Girls' Generation Scanlations)",
