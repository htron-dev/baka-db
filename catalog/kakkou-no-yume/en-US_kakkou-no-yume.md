## Sinopse

A drama story about Natsuka, his best friend and his sex friend. Natsuka has been in love with his best friend, Hakushima, for four years without any gain. Though not wanting to stain his best friend and their friendship he never confesses. To divert his feelings from Hakushima, Natsuka embraces his sex friend, Seno, as a substitute. One day, Seno ends up running over Hakushima while on his motorcycle and this leaves Hakushima unconscious. Later, Seno wakes up saying "I am Hakushima." Natsuka comes up with the idea of embracing his sex friend who now has Hakushima's soul inside.
