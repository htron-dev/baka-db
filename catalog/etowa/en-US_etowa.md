## Sinopse

Chapters 1-3: Love Machine: Phase 1-3
Chapter 6: Love Machine: Bonus
Kokuyou is a obsessive writer and life-long loner. When his scientist friend gives him a "replica", a boy android, he doesn't want it. Will Shiro's puppy like devotion be what Kokuyou really needs? (Source: M-U)

Chapter 4: Sweetoy - Sde Story to "Love Machine".
When the more sophisticated, fully-grown, male model of Etowa (the android model) was developed, the prototype was Hachi. This is the story of his early days.

Chapter 5: My Boyfriend is a Vampire - Oneshot
Shiozaki and his classmate Hagashi are boyfriends. The only problem is not that Higashi is a vampire, because all those stories about vampires aren't really true, except for one thing: when they make love, Higashi can't keep from sucking Shiozaki's blood.
