    "sinopse": "It is the year 1999. In Nagano Matsushiro stands the pyramid of Japan, the private Voltstein Academy.\n\nThis place is famous for the repeated occurrences of occult phenomenon within its premises. Hence, it is also called the Occult Academy. The dean is committed to studying the occult, while the students are zealous in their everyday schoolwork.\n\nOne day, the dean passes away and his occult-hating daughter, Kumashiro Maya, visits the academy. There, she meets a self-proclaimed spoon-bending \"time agent\" from the year 2012, Uchida Fumiaki. As the two encounters various bizarre phenomenon within the academy, the reason for Fumiaki's timeslip to 1999 becomes clear.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
