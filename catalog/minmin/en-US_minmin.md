## Sinopse

MinMin was a witch who lived in the Magic World and studied magic under Balma-sensei. Because of her stupidity, MinMin was cursed into a doll and exiled to the Human World. As a mini-sized doll, MinMin was able to live and do many things just like normal human, but she can't use magic when she was still that form. One day, MinMin was found by a poor college student named Ichiya who lived in a poor apartment. When he kissed MinMin in her doll form, she changed back into a witch girl. However, every time she went to sleep, she will returned back to her form as a doll, and Ichiya will have to kiss her again.

This story was about the adventures of MinMin, Ichiya, Kunitachi (a rich male model with an obsession of the Magic World and crushing on MinMin), Amon (The Prince of the Magic World who was also MinMin's childhood friend), and Shiva (Amon's loyal servant). This manga was highlighted in a light humorous way with charming characters.
