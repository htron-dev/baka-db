    "sinopse": "What do animals do in the spring of their lives? They mate! Wildly!\n\nFour mischievous friends have met their match: their own hearts! Now that they're older, the only troubles these country boys find make them moan and pant. Kou-chan wants to confess to Kishi, but he's full of heart-pounding doubt over Kishi s response. Mitsuru, the serious boy pining for a lost love, is ambushed by Tarou, an obtuse, air-headed sadist, full of devotion for his darling. And who is this tall boy, beating everyone up yet shooting flowers out of the panels? Somebody needs to figure out his body language.\n\n(Source: MU)",
