## Sinopse

With the upcoming inter high basketball tournament coming up, Akira Takashiro and Eiji Kudou declared a competition: whoever scores more points in the tournament will confess to Miku Aizawa, the girl they both have had a crush since childhood. However, just as the rivalry was to be resolved, an earthquake knocks Akira out. When he wakes up, he finds hideous monsters swarming his school, leaving tons of corpses and blood on the ground...

Where is Eiji? What is happening? And why? As he moves on, shocking revelations will be unveiled, and maybe there's something deeper that the government is hiding.
