## Sinopse

Kitty was left heartbroken after her affair with Jake, who was far above her status. After spending their first night together, he suddenly seemed to become a different person, and then married another woman! "I'll never come back to this place," she vowed. Time passes and Kitty makes it big as an actress. However, hearing of her grandmother's death, she returns to her hometown for the first time in 8 years, only to bump into Jake! "You finally came back," he said. Jake, a man who left a deep scar in her heart... But why does her heart flutter when she sees him?
