## Sinopse

Katagiri Yuuji is a divorced, single, lazy gambling addict whose only real activity is playing Pachinko. He does it well enough to get by, but his life is more or less empty... until a young girl named Miura Satomi appears, who is a big fan of his. A classic story by Fukumoto about Pachinko, attraction, and the thrill of gambling.
