    "sinopse": "Asagi can't seem to catch a break. He has his dad, his brother, and a group of yakuza, all trying to capture and confine him because they think he stole some money. His only ally and companion is a sadistic lawyer name Takatsukatsu who has his own issues and can't seem to keep his hands off Asagi either. Will Asagi ever find relief from this pack of men competing for dominance over him, and more importantly, will he ever be free from the collar they keep putting around his neck? Check it out and see for yourself!\n\n(Source: DMG)",
