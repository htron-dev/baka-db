## Sinopse

Even though he grew up in a farm, Akinori Kimura never wanted to become a farmer. But after his wedding, he ended up taking over his father's lands. His daily life will be turned upside down when he discovers that his wife is allergic to pesticides. Akinori decides to do the impossible at the time: grow his apples naturally. During ten years of his life Akinori will never give up.
