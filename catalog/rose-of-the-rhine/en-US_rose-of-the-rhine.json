    "sinopse": "King Dietrich of Bern and his loyal advisor, Hildebrand, have been summoned to the neighboring kingdom by a beautiful princess. She wishes to hold a tournament to test the strength of her fiancé, and discover the strongest warrior in the land. In return, she’ll bestow a wreath of roses from her private garden, and a tender kiss, upon the victor. Though Dietrich would rather stay home, he has to venture forth when Hildebrand sets off without him. Once at the tournament, the sullen king prefers not to take part in the pointless game, but Hildebrand cleverly manipulates him to fight. Will Dietrich be able to defeat the dragon-scaled Siegfried?
