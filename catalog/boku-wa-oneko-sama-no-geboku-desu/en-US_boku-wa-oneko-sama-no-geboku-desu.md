## Sinopse

Izumi Yukihara, high school second year. His life is completely average-until a series of misfortunate events turn his life upside down. As if losing his parents weren't enough, he's saddled with their massive debt and forced to relocate to a new residence. On the bright side, the owners of his new residence offer him a chance to repay his debt...by serving cats?!
