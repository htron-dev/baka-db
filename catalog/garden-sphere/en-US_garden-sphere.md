## Sinopse

The kingdoms of Karna and Horun have been at war for a long time. In an attempt to end this never-ending conflict, a political marriage has been arranged between Roh Ezur Karna, the easily flustered prince of Karna, and Sukur Radirest Horun, the petite yet feisty princess of Horun. A foreign prince who is easily distinguishable by his large wolflike ears would attract unwanted attention from the population of Horun, a people recognizable by their large horns. To avoid such, Roh and Sukur are brought to the Garden Sphere, a small isolated palace in Horun.

Despite not being familiar with each other, the two royals are forced to act like a couple, all for the sake of representing the reconciliation between Karna and Horun. However, neither of them has had any prior romantic experience, and it does not help that there is only a year left before they will show their affection to the public.

With the fate of Karna and Horun's armistice hanging in the balance, the newlyweds attempt to learn the basics of love—even though they are clueless about romance.
