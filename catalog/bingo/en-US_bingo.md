## Sinopse

Trouble follows Kisanuki Shin around. Accidents and fights always seem to find him, but Shin's quick reflexes and strong martial arts keep him relatively safe. As his bad luck would have it, Shin causes a car accident that totals an expensive Porsche, burdening him with a large debt. Unable to pay, Shin faces the prospect of dropping out of school to work—something he desperately wants to avoid. Due to his past delinquent behaviour, Shin was only admitted on the good graces and trust of the chairman's representative; thus, Shin doesn't want to trouble him or betray his faith.

Fortunately, Shin's recent actions haven't gone unnoticed. A popular model, Takami Ukon, witnessed both the car accident and a fight that Shin effortlessly dominated. He approaches Shin at school and proposes a deal: Shin protects Ukon from harm, and Ukon will pay the monthly installments on Shin's debt. With barely any thought, Shin agrees to the deal. However, it turns out that Ukon was hiding his own secrets—he's a strong fighter himself and also a magnet for trouble! It looks like Shin will be working hard for his paychecks.
