    "sinopse": "The 1980's was an unusual decade. The price of land skyrocketed, and the value of money went well above the norm. The numbers that defined the world all spun out of control, launching one of the largest bubble economies Japan had ever seen.\n\nFor Mahjong, as well, it was an age that saw high stakes games on a scale unlike any age before it. And in this age, a man some call \"Kai\" lives as a \"Mukoubuchi,\" what true, lone-wolf gamblers are called.\n\n(Source: Batoto)",
