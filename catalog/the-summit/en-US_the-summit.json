    "sinopse": "A high school dropout and a pocket picking delinquent find themselves bound together by an undeniable attraction.\n\nHan Sae-Lee is every girl's dream: tall, dark, and handsome, with a whole lot of attitude. He knows he's a catch, but right now he's more interested in catching a brazen, blond brat and teaching him a lesson or two. Looks like every girl's dream man has some growing pains to go through.\n\nBold and edgy—the first boys' love story from Korea that is sure to entice the senses.\n\n(Source: DramaQueen)\n\nThis series is on hiatus.",
