## Sinopse

A collection of short stories:

Starry Night: Brainy Yunjoo has her head in the stars--literally--as a member of her school's astronomy club. But her universe is about to be turned upside down by a treacherous romantic rival...

Toy Soldier: It's Alice in Wonderland with spectacular action scenes when a young girl learns that the make-believe world of her dolls is more real--and more deadly--than she ever imagined!

An Autumn Parting: Nothing stops one of Heaven's clock-punchers from finishing his tasks--not even when the mission calls for taking a mortally ill young girl's soul to the afterworld.

Shine Like a Star: A carefree bachelor discovers unexpected depths in himself when he takes in a homeless street kid with a smart mouth.
