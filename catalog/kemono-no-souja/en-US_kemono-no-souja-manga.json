She has a big love for animals, especially the Touda, dragon-like creatures used in the war.\n\nHer mother Soyon was originally of the Mist People, an ancient clan whose members have green eyes. Because Erin's late father was the son of the chief of a village of Touda breeders, Erin and Soyon live there and Soyon is the head Touda doctor.\n\nBut one night, the Kiba, the Duke's strongest Touda, mysteriously die, and Erin's life will be changed forever, involving her into the fate of the whole country.\n\nThe series tells the story of Erin's life from childhood into adulthood.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 11: Ryokui no Hito",
