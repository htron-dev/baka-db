    "sinopse": "Cranry Bennett is a bachelorette nearing the age of thirty—rather peculiar for a woman in late 19th century England. Opting to forego the traditional lifestyle of a housewife, she runs a small cafe in town, but when things begin falling apart at home, she finally decides to hire herself a maid.\n\nUpon returning home one evening, Cranry is greeted by her first applicant: the orphaned 13-year-old Shirley Madison. Having then realized she had forgotten to specify an age requirement on her flyer, she is initially reluctant, but after conversing with the young Shirley and being impressed by her mature demeanor and eagerness to work, she offers the little maid a job.\n\nShirley tells the lighthearted and wholesome story of a young girl searching for her place in the world and the happiness that fills her heart upon finding acceptance from others.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
