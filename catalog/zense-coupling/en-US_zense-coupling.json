    "sinopse": "Once upon a time, cruel fate led four couples to never meet their happy ends. But now, years later, all eight people have been reincarnated, and some retain memories of their previous lives! Even reincarnation is not able to stop their love, be it between a princess and her butler, a master and his cat, a hot-headed man and his equally hot-headed arranged fiancée, or a devoted man and his sickly lover.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
