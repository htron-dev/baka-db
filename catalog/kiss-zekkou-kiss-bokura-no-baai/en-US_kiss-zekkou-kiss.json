    "sinopse": "This series is a prelude to the relationship between Sakisasa and Hatori, their ups and downs. What sets this series apart is the fact that each situation is told twice - from the girl's POV and then the guy's POV. That hence makes it a very interesting read and provides the reader with the chance to look at the two different sides of a coin.\n\n(Source: VK Scans)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Karada@Meate",
