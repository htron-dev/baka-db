## Sinopse

Continuation of Kiss, Zekkou, Kiss, a shoujo manga following the relationship between Sakisaka and Hatori—the ups and downs, misunderstandings, the tears and the laughter.

A unique thing about this series is that each story/situation is told twice—once from the girl's perspective, and once from the guy's perspective! The reader ends up learning what each side was thinking.
