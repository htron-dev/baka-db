## Sinopse

Meet Yohji and Iku, a couple of transporters (truck drivers) who have found a fun way of passing those long hours on the road. Meanwhile, their boss (who is quite amusing) is depending on them to make sure that they don't lose customers to a rival transportation company. Can they help keep their company alive?
(from B-U)
