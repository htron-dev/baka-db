## Sinopse

Shinonome Azuma hasn't made any friends in high school, and his classmates pick on him and get him to do lots of work for the classroom. One day, he runs into a transfer student, Saionji Sai, who says he is a director from his former school's club, and who convinces Azuma to join the theater club with him. After joining the quirky theater club, timid Azuma's life will never be the same!
