## Sinopse

Mutsu Tsukumo was considered to be one of the greatest fighters of all time. He conquered Japan's mixed martial arts (MMA), became the US boxing heavy weight champion and later came up on top at the Vale Tudo in Brazil where the best of the world compete. He accomplished all of this in 2 years and took the competitive fighting world by storm. However, just as the world recognized him to be the best, Mutsu Tsukumo disappeared into thin air and has not been heard of by anybody for almost 3 years.

Just as the world begins to doubt the Enmei style that Tsukumo uses, he returns to everyone's surprise. Follow Mutsu Tsukumo's story in the sequel to Shura no Mon as he attempts to regain his status as the strongest fighter.
