What might develop between them?\n\n3. Koboreru Uso to Pierce Hole\n   “Everything you say sounds like a lie.” After hearing that from a classmate, she vowed to change, but earrings and dyed hair might just get in the way of her new found honesty.\n\n4. Koiiro Tayori\n   When Megumu found a misplaced love letter, she went to return it to the underclassman who had written it. Only, he didn’t look like the type to have written something so serious.\n\n5. Yonjyuukyuu no Eien\n   “Uera-kun, you’re not running any more?” Those were the last words she thought she’d say to the boy she loved, who died that afternoon saving a girl from being hit by a car–until his ghost appeared.
