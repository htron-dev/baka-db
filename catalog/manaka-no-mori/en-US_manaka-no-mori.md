## Sinopse

Manaka is a high school girl who is burying herself in part-time jobs. One day at an old mountain shrine, she meets the physical form of a god of fire named Chikaomi. As they continue meeting each other at that shrine, Manaka gradually finds her previously monochrome daily life becoming filled with color. Set in the city of Sendai, Japan, warm bonds spun together by meetings and departures.

A romantic story about an awkward girl and a god who's lost his powers.
