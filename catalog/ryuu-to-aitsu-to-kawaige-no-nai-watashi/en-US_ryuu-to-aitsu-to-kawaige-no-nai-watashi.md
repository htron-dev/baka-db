## Sinopse

Ange, a royal palace magician is looked down by her peers even thought she has excellent ability, just because she's a commoner. To bear the loneliness, she closed her heart and lost her cute side. Ange gets given a mission to save the world by defeating a demon king. As well as this, her chosen partner is Rex, a knight who was born in a family of heroes, but has a fear of blood.
