## Sinopse

As a child, Kazuki's head was filled with the stories his dad told him of another planet called Artemis. Even now that he's older and his dad has passed away, Kazuki refuses to stop believing. All he wants to do is visit Artemis, and a surprising chain of events may just give him his chance! Now Kazuki begins a quest to learn about the new world he finds himself in and the strange people he meets.
