    "sinopse": "Born into a shamanic family, Sunbi has inherited the power to see and communicate with spirits from her grandmother, a noted shaman and savior of the little fishing village in the South Sea that they live in. As a young child, Sunbi can see the supernatural, such as a fraudulent shaman being thrashed by a dragon of the deep. Because she does not understand that none of her schoolmates can see such things, she becomes feared and alienated. Her powers make her the amorous target of hedonistic demons even when she is but a child.\n\nLong shielded from the realities of her power, she finally learns the secrets behind her mother's death, and why her grandmother was never able to leave their village.\n\n(Source: Netcomics, edited)",
