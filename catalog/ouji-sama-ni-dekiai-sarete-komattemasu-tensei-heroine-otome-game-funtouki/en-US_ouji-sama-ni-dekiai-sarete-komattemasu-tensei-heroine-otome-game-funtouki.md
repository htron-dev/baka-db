## Sinopse

Sylvia was reborn into the world of otome games. "And not only that, I became the heroine of an R18 one?!"

Sylvia decided that she would evade all the destruction flags and live in peace. "I'll do my best to survive this game," she said. However, the prince, a capture target she wasn't aiming for, became fond of her and began to disturb all of her events. "Although he is handsome, this is different from I've planned." "In the first place, I excluded him because he has a terrible setting!"

Now cornered, what will Sylvia do?
