However, the prince, a capture target she wasn't aiming for, became fond of her and began to disturb all of her events. \"Although he is handsome, this is different from I've planned.\" \"In the first place, I excluded him because he has a terrible setting!\"\n\nNow cornered, what will Sylvia do?\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
