Miku, on the other hand, is a bit skeptical. Sure, she has recently started dating a third year, has a decent part-time job, and her home life is peaceful. In fact, you could even say that Miku is content... but, maybe, too content?\n\nUnfortunately, when she comes home Miku no longer has time to find out that her father has quit his job, and her parents are turning their home into a... boarding house? And, even worse, one of the new boarders is a guy from her school?! Miku is quickly going to find her peaceful days a distant memory from the past...",
