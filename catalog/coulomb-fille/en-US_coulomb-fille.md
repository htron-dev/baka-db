## Sinopse

The story follows Kanzou Wakai, a 15-year-old who is considered weird due to his hair which has looked like "dried seaweed" since birth. The boy with the troubled adolescence happens to encounter Noemi Hokari, a mysterious, peculiar girl who believes that she "cannot touch people." Were the "dried seaweed monster" and the "electrified girl" destined to meet?
