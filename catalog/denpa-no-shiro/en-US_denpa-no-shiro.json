    "sinopse": "Amamiya Shio was a radio weather girl from Hokkaido who came to Tokyo to pursue her dream of being a television newscaster. She seeks the help of a once famous talent manager, Kujiraoka, who introduced many models to the industry. Shio has great speaking skills and has the looks but, most of all, she has the aura of experience surrounding her. In fact, unknown to everyone else, Shio's every move, how insignificant it may seem, is part of her big plan to move from the nightly weather girl to the most influential journalist the country has ever seen.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
