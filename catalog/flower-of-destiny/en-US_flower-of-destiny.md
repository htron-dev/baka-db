## Sinopse

When King Hasana hears of the prophecy that he will die by someone from the Sui Tribe, in order to thwart the prophecy, he seeks out the potential killer, only to find that his "murderer" was only a child. Instead of killing him, Hasana takes the child back as a slave.

As the child, Dakasin, and King Hasana begin feeling sympathetic towards each other... Destiny threatens to tear them apart....
