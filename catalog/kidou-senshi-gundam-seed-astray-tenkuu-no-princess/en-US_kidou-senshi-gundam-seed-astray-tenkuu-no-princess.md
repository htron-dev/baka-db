## Sinopse

The Cosmic Era. Coordinators, born through genetic modification and Naturals, who are born naturally. Both experienced two great wars. People devoted themselves to fighting for things they believed in and things they should protect. Fighting gives birth to hatred and hatred in turn gives birth to sorrow. The battlefield swallows the fate of the soldiers and turned into the gravestone to an invisible future.

Although a transient piece arrived in the end, the scars of war run deep. Yet in such a world, there were those who walked a path they strongly believed. Engineers giving their lives and roles to that which was discarded and destroyed: Junkers. Those who fight for those without power: Mercenaries. Those who convey the truth to the people: Journalists. Even if they deviate from the noble path, they will follow a path they believe in according to their own beliefs... Astray.
