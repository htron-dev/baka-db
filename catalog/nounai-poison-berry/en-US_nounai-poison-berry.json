    "sinopse": "Sakurai Ichiko is a 29-year-old woman whose head contains council members (each with differing personalities) that dictate her every thought and decision. While waiting at the train station one day, she encounters Saotome, a man whom she met and made short conversation with at a drinking party with friends. Although she's interested in him, being a much a older woman, Ichiko hesitates over whether or not she should approach him, causing a wave of uproar between her intracranial council members.\n\n(Source: Asian Girls on Mopeds)",
