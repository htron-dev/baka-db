## Sinopse

This love is too heavy!

Lutia, the reincarnation of the Holy Sword Exceltier, was just a normal girl working for the guild. One day, the Holy Sword's former owner and the hero, Ashard, walks into the guild! The Holy Sword Exceltier completed its role after the battle against the Demon Lord but it seems that Ashard loved the Holy Sword too much, even going as far to bathe and sleep with it! If he finds out Lutia is the reincarnation of Exceltier, what will happen to his love?
