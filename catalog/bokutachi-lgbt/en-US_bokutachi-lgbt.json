    "sinopse": "\"LGBT,\" which stands for Lesbian (a woman who loves a woman), Gay (a man who loves a man), Bisexual (a man or woman who loves both men and women), and Transgender (a person who holds a gender identity that is not bound by societal definitions of gender), is collective term for sexual minorities.\n\nSexual minorities...? No, no. In the diverse contemporary society, they already exist as normal \"personalities!\" There are still many hardships and difficulties, but they have positive attitudes toward love, and even marriage!\n\nThis is an essay comic delivering \"99.9% experience stories\" on the romantic affairs of those individuals, as well as of the author who has come out as a bisexual.\n\n(Source: Shueisha, translated)",
