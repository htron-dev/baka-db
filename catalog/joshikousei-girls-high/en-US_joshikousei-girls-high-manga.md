## Sinopse

High school is a time of new opportunity, new adventures... and the same old silliness that you thought you grew out of. Yuma, Eriko, and Ayano are three friends starting their years at an all-girls high school, and are forced to learn just how things run in this new crazy world. Classes, cliques, and even sex... nothing is avoided when high school girls are let loose!
