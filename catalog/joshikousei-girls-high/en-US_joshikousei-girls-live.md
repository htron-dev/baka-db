## Sinopse

Hanako and her two friends are very passionate about remedying feminine problems. They have a series of suggestive pun high school club names for each cause they undertake. Some examples of their causes include a crusade against the burden of wearing bras and panties and an effort to design an ideal vibrator for a woman. They tend to take their ideas a little too far, even pulling Hanako's male childhood friend into their plans, but at least they never have a lack of enthusiasm!
