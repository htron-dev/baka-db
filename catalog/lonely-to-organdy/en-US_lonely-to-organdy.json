    "sinopse": "Haruto Soma used to love music. Previously, he would write songs to play on the guitar and sing along to them. Haruto left his hometown to come to Tokyo and pursue a musical career, but his first live street performance was a major discouragement. Since then, he no longer experiences the same joy on the rare occasions he touches his instrument.\n\nStill living in Tokyo, Haruto is struck by a scooter one evening and taken to a hospital due to the alarming amount of blood at the accident site. Luckily, he is discharged a few days later, relatively unscathed; the only remaining ill-effect is a fuzzy feeling in his head.\n\nWhen Haruto returns home, he discovers a stranger lounging comfortably on the floor of his living area. His first thought is to wonder who this person is; the stranger, however, questions why Haruto suddenly notices him, because he wasn't able to see ghosts before!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
