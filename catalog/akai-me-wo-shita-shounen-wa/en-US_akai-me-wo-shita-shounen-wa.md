## Sinopse

When his friend's younger brother, Ryou, cried and confessed to Yoshiyuki, Yoshiyuki didn't reject Ryou and went out with him. Yoshiyuki always drew a line between them because Ryou was still a high-schooler. As Ryou's love became more passionate and stronger, Yoshiyuki couldn't help and kissed him. Would their love advance to the next level soon?
