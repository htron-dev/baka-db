## Sinopse

Matsuri had always been victimized and bullied because of her bright red hair. One day, two brothers are hired to work at her family's bed and breakfast. It seems they have run away from home and are trying to earn their way in the world. However, there might be more to them that meets the eye... especially the strong, silent Tsukiya who manages to look past Matsuri's red hair and see her for who she really is.
