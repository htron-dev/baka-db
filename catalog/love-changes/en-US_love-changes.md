## Sinopse

Manga adaptation by Ayako Shibata, based on Barbara Bretton's novel "Love Changes"

When first love failed her, it took someone special to prove love changes... It took Stacey Andersen five years to put the pieces of her life back together after her fiance walked out. As a successful businesswoman with part ownership in a small computer company, Stacey was satisfied--until Franco Borelli exploded into her peaceful world. Sophisticated and secure, Franco shook her very core, and with burning ecstasy threatened the deepest, darkest secret any woman could ever reveal!
