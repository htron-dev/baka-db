## Sinopse

The novels center on Thea, a boy whose dream is to become a ceremonial swordmaker. On his way to the capital to realize his dream, he is attacked by orcs, but just at that moment, a strange female swordfighter appears and slaughters the orcs brutally in an obvious overkill. Her name is Shey, and she wields a cursed weapon. Thea then finds himself becoming Shey's exclusive blacksmith.
