## Sinopse

Nine years ago when Amane was a little girl, she wished to save her grandfather. When she did, a god named Shizuka appeared and said he could save him. However, in return Amane ended up promising to become Shizuka's wife when she turned sixteen. Now, she has grown up but this perverted god doesn't want anyone to have her so he cast a spell on her and turned her into a little girl!

Amane desperately wants to have him change her back to her normal size permanently and get this god out of her life! Because this good looking yet perverted god still wants to make her his bride and consummate the marriage!
