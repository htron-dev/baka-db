## Sinopse

Hisanori Nouchi is a 38-year-old virgin. It's not that he's uninterested in women; it's just that he hasn't had many successful opportunities to meet them. While he works for an ordinary company during the day, at night, he's actually a successful erotic novelist. One day after work, he happens to help a pretty lady named Chika who invites him to a meal as thanks. However, there's no way that Chika is actually a young man dressed as a woman is there?
