## Sinopse

Takeda is a boy who loves football. He switches high school numerous times, and finally he finds a school where there is a football club. Unfortunately, as he has no official football record, he cannot play as a striker, but is positioned by the captain as a Libero, a special type of defender which runs freely around the field playing in both offence and defence.
