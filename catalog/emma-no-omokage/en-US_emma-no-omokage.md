## Sinopse

Manga adaptation by Masako Watanabe, based on Kay Thorpe's novel "Master of Morley."

He wanted an heir more than a wife! The rigid conventions of Morley Grange had driven Emma's grandmother into exile when she had dared love a man beneath her social station. Now Emma had returned to her ancestral home and found love with the present master of Morley. Only Emma wasn't at all sure her grandmother would have approved! For although Emma loved Craig Stafford deeply, he had proposed to her only because he wanted a son and she satisfied his family's standards. Would marrying him be the worst mistake of her life?
