## Sinopse

I like romantic comedies. However, romance doesn't develop like that in reality. There was once a time where I thought that. Encountering a girl who fell from the sky, my school life changes with a clang. From the author of the popular harem comedy Noucome comes a new out of this world romantic comedy!
