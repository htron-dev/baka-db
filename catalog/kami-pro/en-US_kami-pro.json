Unfortunately for him, the god that gets assigned to his temple turns out to be a war god, Tonari. In this peaceful world, Tonari's war powers only bring unwanted chaos and not a lot of help for Kagetsuna's promotional ideas. These two will have to figure out a way to use Tonari's powers so that the temple doesn't completely go bankrupt.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
