This seemed to have affected the Defense Army as a whole. Love started blooming everywhere: between the enemy commander and the colonel’s assistant, Miller; the instructor and his new soldier; the intelligence captain and the enemy’s spy; the mercenary captain and the elite chief of staff. Couples were accumulating in droves!\n\n(Souce: FantasyShrine)",
