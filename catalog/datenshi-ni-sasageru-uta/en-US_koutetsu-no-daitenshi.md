## Sinopse

After his older brother died in the war, Hanse has no one if not for Colonel Michel Rosenberg who took him under his wing. Despite the Colonel’s cocky attitude which Hanse dislikes, the orphaned boy couldn’t help but respond to the Colonel’s sexual advances.

But where does a wedding and a honeymoon in the battlefield fit in the story?!

The book also includes 3 oneshots: a boy who seduces his older brother’s friend, a high school student who volunteers to be the collateral for his brother’s loan, etc… sexy, scandalous love stories with sweet temptations.
