## Sinopse

Fujita is a second year middle school student with a face as pretty as a girls. On top of that he's whimpy and a bit of a crybaby so he's often confused for a girl. Echo-chan is a fairy who promises to grant his wish and turn him into a strong and attractive man capable of sweeping Onigasaki, his unrequited love, off her feet if he agrees to help her.
