## Sinopse

Ondal's task is to recapture the three demons that Tangun let loose. Of course, Ondal is not remotely capable of accomplishing the task. Therefore, Hemosu accompanies Ondal. Hemosu recruits his old student, David Copperfield who by the way Ondal thinks a gay, to the team. The team also encounters Samson, and she eventually joins the team after destruction of Vatican city. A little later, Pai and Pei join the team.
