    "sinopse": "He's a prince and she is the daughter of a gang member. How could it ever work between them?\n\nJanis visits her husband, Mykal, for the first time and is shocked by the size of his mansion. She is also worried. She wants Mykal to divorce her and relinquish custody of the baby she's carrying. But will he agree to such a thing? Just then a man is carried into the mansion by a medic van. The man is none other than Mykal! He is apparently returning home after being severely injured in an accident. The strong, confident Mykal that Janis once knew now seems completely different. And just when Janis thought things couldn't get any worse, she realizes he has no memory of her!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
