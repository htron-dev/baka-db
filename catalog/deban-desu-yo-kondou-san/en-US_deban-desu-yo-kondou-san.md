## Sinopse

Everything was supposed to change for Kondou Isami in high school. She was known for her impulsive and masculine personality in middle school due to her life being centered around kendo. As the national champion for two years in a row, she was the best, but, as a consequence of that lifestyle, she was no longer attractive to the boys. Vowing to become more girly and refined when she starts attending Seishinkan High School, fate seems to fight against her will until she joins the idol club at school.
