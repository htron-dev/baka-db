He was called upon using an Otherworldly Grass which found it's way to his world. The reason for summoning him was to dispel the lingering attachment and/or regrets of a group of heroic spirits from another world.\n\nBrought up as a hero to dispel regrets, the era of the world made him into a demon lord instead.\n\n(Source: Novel Updates)",
