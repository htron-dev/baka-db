    "sinopse": "A heated rooftop confession takes place between two men, but not all is as it seems. The good-natured Souta Aoki has had his heart stolen by the angelic smile and kind actions of his female crush Mio Hashimoto. Unfortunately, he is devastated when she lends him an eraser with another classmate's name—Ida—engraved on top. When Kousuke Ida spots his name on the eraser, he is led to believe that Aoki is the one harboring romantic feelings for him. Aoki is left struggling to clear up the situation alone without revealing Hashimoto's feelings for Ida. Fake and honest pinings mix as misunderstandings abound in this heart-pounding triangle of first loves.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
