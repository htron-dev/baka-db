## Sinopse

Daisuke, who runs a local livestock business, spent his ordinary days working until his childhood friend Masataka returned home and his life changed completely. In the past, Daisuke molested Masataka, but now he's being blackmailed, asking for his body in return. Can the two of them lay on the hay in the barn like before?
