    "sinopse": "A god of a different world had abruptly appeared in Kamiya Yato's classroom and forcibly summoned the entire class to his world... except for him—because he was sleeping in a seat in the corner of the class, and the summoning magic circle didn't reach him—and he ended up staying here on Earth, but with brand-new skills.\n\nAfter he made it through a whole year full of police interviews and journalism reports, he finally became a high school student, but the quiet days he had hoped for were far from over—be it terrorists who decide to occupy his school or even monsters from different world, one by one new incidents take place in the town he lives in...\n\nWill a boy without any motivation be able to save the world?\n\n(Source: Novel Updates, edited)",
