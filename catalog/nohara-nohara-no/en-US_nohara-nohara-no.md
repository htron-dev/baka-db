## Sinopse

Life doesn’t always go as planned. High school sophomore and star catcher Itoshima devoted every fiber of his being to baseball, only to have the cruel mistress that is fate rip his one love in life away from him, due to an irrecoverable injury. Freshman Saitozaki never dreamt that his beginning days of high school, what should be the prime of his youth, would consist of battling incompetent bus schedules, unsympathetic teachers, and punishments that put his very life at risk. He also never imagined having these strange new feelings that have arisen ever since Itoshima crossed his path in his time of need. Is fate playing another harsh trick on this hapless duo, or will Saitozaki and Itoshima take destiny into their own hands and rediscover how to laugh and love?
