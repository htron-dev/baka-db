## Sinopse

The protagonist is 16 years old and sports a pair of glasses. Although he didn't notice until Sakura came, he's actually half nekogami and half human. He is liked by cats and can understand their language. He's also the object of extreme "reverse harassment" by just about every female character in the story.
