## Sinopse

Sachi has always been known for her gorgeous amber-colored hair that she inherited from her mother. She has a happy enough life, except for the fact that her mother is dead, which she keeps a secret.

One day, she is approached by a classmate who seems to know all her family's secrets, and is forced into his "Money Game."
