    "sinopse": "Akihisa Yoshii is a student at Fumizuki Academy, a brand new, prestigious school which has implemented unique educational methodologies. One of those is the Placement Exam, which divides the students into classes based on their scores, with the best going to Class A and the worst to Class F. The higher the class, the more privileges and luxuries they have. Yoshii, placed into Class 2-F, is also labeled the biggest idiot in the class on top of everything else.\n\nThe most important event at the school is the Summoner Test War, made possible by advanced technology where the students summon creatures and wage war against other classes for a chance to earn the assets of that class. Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu! tells the hilarious story of Yoshii during Class 2-F's battles against the other classes on their way to the top.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
