## Sinopse

Ayaka, who works at the bridal department at a hotel, has a beauty that everyone recognizes, yet her personality is the worst. Everyone calls her a "wicked woman" after the way she wraps numerous men around her finger. The one who sets his eyes on her is the hotel's new executive Tougou, who is the son of a very powerful person of the town. What are the orders that this King-like man requests of her!?
