## Sinopse

Lewin Randit is a first-year student attending the Gaius School of Witchcraft and Wizardryâ€”except that he shows no aptitude for magic. Currently in training as a Swordsman, Lewin is constantly picked on by classmates and teachers alike for his lack of talent. But one day in the library, Lewin makes a couple of friends from the Magic division, and for the first time ever there are people who actually enjoy his company. However, a visit to the Magic division's labs goes awry when Lewin and his new friends accidentally unleash an army of undead! Now a team of inexperienced first-year students must fend off a magical dilemma that even the school professors would have trouble with.
