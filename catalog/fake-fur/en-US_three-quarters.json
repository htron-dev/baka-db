However, their school friends are starting to question the closeness of their friendship...\n\n7. Sleeping Lovers\n   Minato likes having a warm body in bed to huggle up with, but every person who shared his bed gets annoyed that he won't do any more than huggle.

Ren agrees to share the bed with Minao, but on one condition: help him to find \"Kanou\".\n\n8. Atogaki\n\n(Source: M-U)",
