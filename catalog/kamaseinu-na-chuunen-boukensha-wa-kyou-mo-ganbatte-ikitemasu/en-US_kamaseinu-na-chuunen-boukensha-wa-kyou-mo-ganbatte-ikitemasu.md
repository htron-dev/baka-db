## Sinopse

This is the comfortable life of a veteran adventurer! The daily life of single middle-aged B-class adventurer, Georg Kylie is too regular compared to his appearance. Eat breakfast, wear armor and head to the Adventurer's Guild. Get a request form, get a reward for doing the commissioned work, finish the side work as a jeweler craftsman, spend time in a tavern of his liking and go to bed. While Georg spends every day like this, sightings of a sub-dragon which is a class A monster come. Soon afterwards he meets a new adventurer girl who wants to sell sub-dragon scales, and he calls out to her.

"Don't lay your hands on Cecil again!"
"Guwah!"

He was mistaken for a molester, and was beaten by a boy who seems to be her companion. After this incident, the daily life of single middle-aged adventurer Georg began to change into a life full of encounters and adventures. From “Let's become a novelist”, let’s look into the scary, but kind middle-aged adventurer's life!
