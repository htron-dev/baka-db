    "sinopse": "Whenever Tomo gets a girlfriend, his selfish childhood friend Hideaki comes between them. Now that Tomo has a new girlfriend, he's on the lookout, but nothing happens. Thinking the lack of intervention strange, Tomo then discovers that Hideaki has a new lover—a man! Maybe he was just showing off, but Tomo can't forget how gentle his friend looked when he was worrying about love.\n\nA straight guy easily moved by kindness and affection and an egotistical hottie with a strong desire to monopolize. They can't go back to the time when they thought they knew everything—a romance blossoms between friends.\n\n(Source: Shinmakoku Scanlations)",
