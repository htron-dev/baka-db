## Sinopse

When she stands, she is a peony; when she sits, she is a lotus; when she walks, she is a lily. Oozing sex, pheromones in full throttle, is the perfectly flawless princess, Hanada Ran. And now that she's transferring from her high-class all girls school to a co-ed school, she's decided to search for her prince! First she meets Kashiwagi Eiji, a pervert who insults her—he's the last man she'd ever want. Then she meets the student body president, Watabe Shizuru, a perfect prince, and sets her sights on him! But then her parents announce that she has an arranged marriage with the son of the people who saved their lives... the Kashiwagi family!?
