## Sinopse

The end of the 21st century in France. Due to the suspension of immigration, the workforce of the country declines. From this concern, dead humans are resurrected with new technology, Bioroids—artificial humans. France is brought back to life. Paris, once known as "The City of Love," or "Capital of the Arts" becomes "The Capital of Illusions"—"La Cité de L'illusion."
