    "sinopse": "The student council of Kokuun High, one of the most prestigious schools in the country, is made up entirely of elite students from families with storied pedigrees. But for some reason, Kousuke Tamanaka, an ordinary student whose only good point is monstrous strength, was chosen to be a new member of the student council! And he was also directly nominated by Junichi Tennomiya... to be his personal bodyguard?!\n\n(Source: Gentosha Comics, translated)",
