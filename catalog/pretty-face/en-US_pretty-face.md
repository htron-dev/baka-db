## Sinopse

Randou Masashi, a self-centered, brash karate star, was the victim of a horrific bus accident that left him comatose, his face terribly disfigured by extensive burns.

Genius plastic surgeon Dr. Manabe saved Randou's life and went to work on his face, gradually reconstructing it based on a photograph found in the wreckage of the bus. But in a cruel twist of fate, the photo that the doctor used as his reference was not a picture of Randou, but of Rina Kurimi, the girl whom Randou has a crush on!
