## Sinopse

After little Tama's mother died, she went to live with her cousins. They accepted her with warmth and love, particularly Nonoko, a 14-year-old girl who was delighted to accept Tama as a younger sister. Nonoko is a cheerful girl with an odd habit of drifting suddenly off to sleep at odd times. Eventually, Tama wanted to go back and live with her Dad. Nonoko accompanies Tama back to her father's house, although they are both uncertain how welcome they would be. Tama's dad is a very quiet man who is difficult to read. Nonoko realizes that she doesn't really know very much about him at all, and she's not exactly sure how much he loves his daughter. She is determined to stay with her little cousin until she knows Tama will be okay. And thus their daily life together begins...
