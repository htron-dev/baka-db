## Sinopse

Hajime Amemiya is a bubbly high schooler who has a problem: He's in love with surly upperclassmen Saburo Ninomiya! Hajime is ready to do whatever it takes to win the love of Saburo, but that may be a bit harder then it sounds. Hajime has to contend with a co-worker that wants him, Saburo's childhood friend, and the fact that Saburo is too much of the strong silent type to ever let Hajime know if his advances are working. Will Hajime be able to win over the heart of his senpai?
