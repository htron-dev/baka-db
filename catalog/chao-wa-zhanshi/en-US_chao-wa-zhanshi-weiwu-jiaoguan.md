## Sinopse

Millennia ago, a ferocious nomadic tribe uncovered a forbidden lair of data crystals. These crystals gave the SWARM tribe advanced knowledge of warfare and genetic manipulation. Like wildfire, their vast empire soon spread across the galaxy, conquering and destroying everything in their path. The few survivors brave enough to fight back rose from the ashes. This is their story.
