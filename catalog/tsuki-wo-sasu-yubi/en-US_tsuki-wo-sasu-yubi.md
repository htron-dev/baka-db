## Sinopse

Fujii Yoshiyuki is a single man who works as a cameraman and has found no success in life. At the age of 32, he enrolls at the Buddhist Institute in order to become a Buddhist monk and to take over the temple of his uncle, who has no heir. Despite the Buddhist etiquette he is not familiar with and thanks to his adventures with his new classmates, Fujii's way of life will inadvertently begin to gravitate towards the core values of Buddhism.
