    "sinopse": "Anne, known to Helen as “Teacher,” first taught her student discipline, then “finger-spelling,” and finally, language itself. Eventually Helen learned how to actually speak. After graduating from college, she travelled and lectured around the world, devoting her life to the creation of a society where people with and without disabilities could live together. Her efforts spurred the development of educational and welfare programs in many countries. Helen’s story is an inspiration for young people everywhere.",
