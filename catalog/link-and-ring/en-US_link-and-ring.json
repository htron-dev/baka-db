    "sinopse": "\"If I ever get brave enough to say I like you from the top of my lungs—\" Bessho coincidentally meets Makita in a university lecture they share, finding out that they both like cute things. While Bessho hides his preferences like a dirty little secret, Makita makes no excuses for who he is and what he likes. Despite the twists and turns they encounter along the way, the pair of lovers deal with their possessive and jealous urges on their slow journey to answering the age-old question: what is the best way to fall in love?\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
