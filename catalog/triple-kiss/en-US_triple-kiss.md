## Sinopse

On the way to school, Yukino stumbles into a handsome boy, and is surprised to find out that he is Sasegawa, a transfer student joining her class; however, when he enters the classroom, nobody can see his beautiful face hidden beneath his thick bangs. At first Yukino is confused as to why he hides his good looks from the class, but as she develops feelings for him, she starts hoping that nobody will see his real face, for fear that the rest of the girls in class fall in love with him as well. How will Yukino and Sasegawa's relationship turn out in the end? And who is the mysterious man who claims to "own" Sasegawa?
