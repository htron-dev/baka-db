## Sinopse

Aoki, a high school teacher, has little motivation for anything other than expending as little effort as possible. After being scolded by a senior teacher, he goes to the infirmary to check on a student that has been skipping class. There he shares his first real conversation with the eerily perceptive school nurse, Manabu Tengoku.
