## Sinopse

Ancient Greece. In a time when women were not even permitted to step foot outdoors on their own... Erinna is a bit of a strange girl who aspires to join the ranks of Greece's finest artists: the poets. Taken under the wing of Sappho, the greatest poetess of her day, Erinna wholeheartedly ignores her maidenhood and domestic training to throw herself into song and harp! She'll be participating in a choir competition in the spring, but...?! Set in an Ancient Greek girls' school, experience the story of Erinna's wonderful youth with her best friend and upperclassmen!
