## Sinopse

Edward the Executor cuts people's heads off with a giant pair of scissors. But one day his heart is punctured and he lands straight in hell. Edward hasn't quite digested the news of his death yet, so he has to look for a job and an apartment, pay the bail and the rent... He quickly realises that hell is going to be hot. He meets Jack the Ripper and finds out that monsters are no longer his biggest problem.
