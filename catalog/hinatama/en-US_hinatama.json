    "sinopse": "Amano Hinata, a high school boy, lives a quiet life in the country. One day, a light-haired transfer student, Kazama Ayato, arrives from Tokyo. In such a small town, it's not long before Hinata runs into the laid-back, absent-minded Ayato, along with with his lively younger siblings: Hayato, Ikuto, and Chiyoko. It's going to be quite a challenge for the Kazama family to assimilate into their new community out in the country!\n\n(Source: Moi-xRyu Scanlations)",
