## Sinopse

Meet Izumi and Tachibana who are right in the middle of a very hot and heavy romance. Seems normal right? Except Tachibana is a teacher at Izumi's all girls high school. Izumi is calm and collected, and is part of the student council. Tachibana is lecherous and always trying to find a way to into Izumi's uniform. See if they can handle their hush-hush relationship and themselves.
