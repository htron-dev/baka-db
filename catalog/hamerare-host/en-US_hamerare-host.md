## Sinopse

Keigo, the #1 host in his shop, always tries to deliver the best service to his customers while keeping everyone happy. But when Taisei-san, a male doctor and a regular visitor to the shop, makes a move on him, Keigo is not sure anymore if this is just another job or if it means something more.

On top of that, he has his hands full with his kouhai, Tomoya, the #2 host, who always tries to upstage him and get his attention.
