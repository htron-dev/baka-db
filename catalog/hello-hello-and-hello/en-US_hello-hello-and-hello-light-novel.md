## Sinopse

"Hey, Yoshi-kun, I..." The first time I heard that voice my feet stopped. On my way back from school, near the bookstore in front of the station. There, in the empty field where the white cat sleeps, a mysterious girl, Shiina Yuuki, always calls out to me.

Happy times, sad times, our memories that fade every time. Repeated promises that are forgotten every time. At that time, I knew nothing. The value of Yuuki's smile, the meaning behind those tears, all those hellos and goodbyes.

A story of encounters and farewells.
