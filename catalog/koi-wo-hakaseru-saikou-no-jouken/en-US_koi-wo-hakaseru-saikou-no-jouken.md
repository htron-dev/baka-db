## Sinopse

Youta's the manager of a high-end women's designer shoe store. He spends all his time and energy pouring his heart and soul into shoes because of his not-so-secret foot/leg/shoe obsession, but he hasn't found his perfect pair of legs yet. One day, part-timer Chika gets forced to try on some sample heels, and Youta gets blown away by the most angelic pair of perfect, slender, and flawless legs he has ever seen. Youta keeps telling himself that Chika's a guy and it was just a momentary lapse of judgment, but when Chika tries them on again after hours, Youta gets so turned on that he loses control and starts licking Chika's legs...!! Are these feelings purely physical, or could it be romantic attraction?
