    "sinopse": "\"I love you! Let's get married!\" That is how Itou's first encounter with Naitou went on their first day of school. Since then, Naitou has been relentless; proposing to Itou at every opportunity and singing his love for her. But Itou is no obedient goodie-goodie to just sit back and let Naitou do as he pleases. Firing back with her own diatribes, she is determined to fight this out till the end.\n\nA comedic tale of two twisted idiots and a boy's neverending pursuit to get his girl... even if that girl absolutely hates him.\n\n(Source: Meraki Scans)",
