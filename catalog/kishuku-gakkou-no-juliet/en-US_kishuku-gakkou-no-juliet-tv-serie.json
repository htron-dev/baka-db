    "sinopse": "We lay our scene in the fair Dahlia Academy, where two countries, both alike in dignity, come together; the \"Black Doggies\" of the Eastern Nation of Touwa and \"White Cats\" of the Principality of West have a longstanding feud. Romio Inuzuka and Juliet Persia, leaders of their respective dorms, seem to be bitter enemies.\n\nIn reality, however, Romio and Juliet are hopelessly in love, but revealing their relationship would call upon the ire of all their comrades. They hide their love to maintain peace, but a clandestine relationship means they miss out on many of the activities couples get to do. As they grow closer together, Romio and Juliet must come to terms with the fact that keeping their relationship a secret may prove to be impossible.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
