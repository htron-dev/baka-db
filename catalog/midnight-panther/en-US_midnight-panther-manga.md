## Sinopse

Taking place in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world, this is the story about three beautiful young females who are the extremely popular girl band called The Pussy Cats who are managed by an old hag. In actuality, the girls are also secretly the notorious female assassins known as The Midnight Panther, who will kill men for money by first sleeping with them and executing them in their own unique manner. The old hag is in reality a witch that also arranges the transactions. However, when the girls receive a commission to kill the despotic king who is killing his subjects, one of them takes the job personally and requests the honor.
