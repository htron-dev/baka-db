    "sinopse": "Sara Kinsale is stunned to be thrown together with a prince of the desert, and even more so to find herself unbelievably attracted to the elusive Sheikh Kahrun bak Samin.... Especially as she's indebted to the sheikh and it's only a matter of time before he demands to be repaid!\n\nKahrun soon names his price -- marriage! He needs a trophy wife, and Sara is already living under his roof. But will she be the sheikh's bride in name only -- or will her marriage duties be a little more intimate...?\n\n(From: Shoujo Manhwa Scans)",
