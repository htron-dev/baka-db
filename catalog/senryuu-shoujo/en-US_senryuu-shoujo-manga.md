## Sinopse

Nanako Yukishiro is an average cute and cheerful high school girl, except for the fact that she does not speak! Her only method of communicating her thoughts and feelings is through senryuu—a form of haiku which utilizes the 5-7-5 format.

Surrounded by friends such as the misunderstood ex-delinquent Eiji Busujima, stalkerish and eternally single club president Amane Katagiri, shy but talkative artist Kino Yakobe, mysterious Tao Hanakai, and Eiji's self-proclaimed "big sister" Koto Ootsuki, Nanako's high school life has never been more enjoyable.
