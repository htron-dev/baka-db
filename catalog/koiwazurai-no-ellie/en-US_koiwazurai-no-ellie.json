    "sinopse": "At school, Eriko Ichimura is a nobody. She looks plain, and her classmates overlook her existence until they need to dump their responsibilities on her. On Twitter, however, she is \"Lovesick Ellie,\" a girl with a vivid imagination who writes posts inspired by her fantasies. Akira Oomi, the object of her fantasies, is the most attractive boy in her school, and everything about him seems to be perfect.\n\nEriko's fantasies take a hit when she accidentally eavesdrops on a conversation between Akira and their homeroom teacher. His true nature is laid bare—he is, in fact, a foul-mouthed and insensitive snob. But when she clumsily forgets her phone at the scene, Akira himself approaches her to return it; however, he has already skimmed through her embarrassing Twitter posts. What Eriko does not expect is him offering to help her realize her fantasies—but only if she stays silent regarding his character.\n\nTrouble seems to follow Eriko wherever she goes, and her luck is absolutely the worst... or is it?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
