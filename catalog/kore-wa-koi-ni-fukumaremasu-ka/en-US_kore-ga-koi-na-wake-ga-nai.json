    "sinopse": "Cold-hearted and diligent Kaoru Iida is deeply hurt when his underclassman rejects him. But along comes Yuzuru Yanagi of the sports club, tall and totally straight, who suddenly tells him, \"It was love at first sight! Please treat me like trash!\" It was such a masochistic and passionate confession. Iida was honestly conflicted over it, but as they're guys, he decides to meet with him every day to take care of their sexual needs.\n\n(Source: Houbunsha, translated)",
