    "sinopse": "Popular guy, Hiiragi Tsukasa saves his classmate, Asahina Iori, from an attempted rape. His initial impression of Asahina was that he was a quiet and studious guy. But he's surprisingly plagued by his problem with attracting guys. So Hiiragi proposes that they pretend to start dating in order to keep the guys off of him. But after promising to protect Asahina from the others, he himself begins to fall for Asahina.\n\n(Source: Hoshikuzuu Scans)",
