## Sinopse

After his father unexpected passed away, Ichirou Kuga had to take care of his two younger sibling, despite only having a middle school education. He became a manga artist but had fallen behind the flow, struggling along in analog while the industry shifted to digital. After losing his assistants to their debut, he's now in huge trouble, as deadline approaches and unable to find assistants who still use pen and paper... Until his editor contacts him with a good news: a new assistant! And the assistant turns out to be a beautiful, mysterious young girl who seems to know more about him than she should...
