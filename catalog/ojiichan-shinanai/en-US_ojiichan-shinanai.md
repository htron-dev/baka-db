## Sinopse

A pure angel descends from the heaven to carry a dying old man to the afterlife. What she doesn't know is that this is not your typical feeble grampa. No, he is much more... charming. Thus, their misadventures begin as the angel realized what type of man she's dealing with. This old man won't die anytime soon.
