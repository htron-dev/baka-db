    "sinopse": "Close friends since childhood, Touma has a long intensifying unrequited love for Takaya.\n\nThough he has a rough personality and mouth, Touma thinks like a maiden and is hurt every day by his own servile thinking and self-deprecation as he cannot express his love. And it doesn't help that Takaya has gotten himself a girlfriend since starting university, and as Takaya's \"nursemaid\" and close friend, Touma can't avoid close contact.\n\nAt the same time, club senpai Yonezawa and a mysterious woman have gotten close to Touma; and here starts the harsh and painful changes in unrequited love for Touma——\n\n(Source: Fujoshi Bitches)",
