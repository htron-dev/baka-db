## Sinopse

The World Rift—a giant line of water jets that divides the world in two. Eight years ago, an epic battle punctured a hole through the rift and strange creatures began to leak into the known world, making it so that the only ones who venture out to sea are fools and pirates.

Cherry Blossom is one of these aspiring pirates, setting out to sea in order to find something important to him. Along the way, he crosses paths with Sun, a mysterious boy who holds the World Rift Tear, an amulet said to be the key to traversing the World Rift and discovering what lies beyond. Together, they set out into uncharted seas, inviting any grand adventures that awaits them!
