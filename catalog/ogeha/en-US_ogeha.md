## Sinopse

Satoshi Kiji has an obsession with weird bugs. One day, to his delight, he finds a girl with winged arms and an insect-like rear. Deciding to bring her home, Kiji names her Ogeha. Treating her like a regular bug, he pokes her and hits her, thinking that she is merely a weird organism. On the other hand, Ogeha has never lived anything other than the life she has with Kiji. She mostly accepts her situation, wondering if enduring endless pain is her destiny.

Ogeha follows Kiji and his giant anthropomorphic bug, Ogeha, depicting their sickening relationship as well as Ogeha's possible otherworldly origins.
