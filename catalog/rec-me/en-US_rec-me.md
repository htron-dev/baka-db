## Sinopse

Yusuke and Chizuru are known actors in the showbiz industry. To everyone else, they appear to be amicable work colleagues, but off cam, they are in a secret and complicated sexual relationship. While their relationship just sort of happened, Yusuke wants nothing but to monopolize Chizuru, but the latter is insistent on riling him up by seducing other people. At times, Yusuke finds something familiar about Chizuru here and there, and it seems Chizuru has his secrets and a plan he's been plotting for all this time.
