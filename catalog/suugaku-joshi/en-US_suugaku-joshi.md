## Sinopse

Masae Yasuda's Suugaku Joshi is a comic adaptation of the author's experience studying mathematics at a Japanese university. Praised by algebraic geometrist Shigeru Iitaka as "a must-read for all mathematicians," this humorous depiction of the trials and tribulations of young women in STEM fields encourages young women to persevere through the difficulties they are likely to encounter.
