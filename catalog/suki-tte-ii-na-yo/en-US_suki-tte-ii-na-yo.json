    "sinopse": "After several incidents during her childhood that involved bullying, 16-year-old Mei Tachibana decided that she did not need friends as they would only ever end up hurting her. She is the exact opposite of Yamato Kurosawa—the most popular boy at school. Having dated several girls in their year already, Yamato is a flirt who gets along with everyone he meets. Mei's aloof demeanor immediately catches Yamato's attention, who vows to become her friend no matter what.\n\nAfter a tense situation where Yamato protects her from a stalker at night, Mei believes that she is developing feelings for him. Soon enough, the two teens find themselves in an unlikely relationship together, much to the dismay of Mei and her jealous classmates. As they grow closer, Mei will need to determine whether or not her affection is genuine and if she has the courage to say \"I love you.\"\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
