## Sinopse

Yuto is a typical male high school student whose family is rooted from a long line of “onmyouji.” One day, while in the family storage house, he accidentally awakens a god who was sealed away hundreds of years ago. This god turns out to be extremely good-looking and possesses immense powers. Now, if only the said god remembered who he was! Stuck with a mysterious amnesiac god who’s strangely attached to him, Yuto ventures into the clamorous life between a high school and a god!
