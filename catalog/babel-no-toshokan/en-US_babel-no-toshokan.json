    "sinopse": "Meet Watase, an awkward teen with an unusual power over the written word. One day he uses that power to do something impossible, which draws the attention of Aiba, a girl he finds interesting. But Aiba lives in a secret world of her own devising, believing that the world around her is a lie. And so Watase's impossible act seems like fate to Aiba, and sets the pair down an unexpected path.\n\n(Source: Lovely Strange Dark)",
