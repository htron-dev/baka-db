## Sinopse

Hagure Narihira is a your average hopeless romantic sophomore in a magical high school for power users. He has no friends and has a crappy ability called the "drain" that unconsciously absorbs human energy within a radius of 1 meter. Because of this "special ability," no one wanted to be his friend much less his girlfriend.
