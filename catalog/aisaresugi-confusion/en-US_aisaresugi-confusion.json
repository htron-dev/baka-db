    "sinopse": "Clean freak Mochida meets his match with his classmate in the same major, Mutou. Oblivious to everything, he clings onto Mochida and doesn't take care of the things Mochida lends him. On top of that, he gives Mochida a porno as a thank-you gift!\n\nLike a big dog, he goes all out and doesn't know how to read the mood, joking all the time. But after a certain incident, he stops touching Mochida. But he's not lonely! Right!?\n\nWith a mischievous dog and a clean-freak, where is this road of love taking them?\n\n(Source: Hoshikuzuu Scans & Yaoi Toshokan)",
