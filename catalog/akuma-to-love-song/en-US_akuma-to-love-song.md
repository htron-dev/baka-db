## Sinopse

Maria Kawai transfers from St. Katria Girls' School to Touzuka Public High School, and her arrival sparks interest for two reasons: St. Katria has an excellent academic reputation compared to Touzuka, and Maria is incredibly cute! When her classmates speculate upon her transfer to their less-than-impressive school, she flatly informs them that she was expelled for violence against her former teacher. This is characteristic of Maria—despite her angelic appearance, she will tell the unadorned truth regardless of social niceties, and as such, people often compare her to a devil.

On her first day, Maria is introduced to Yuusuke Kanda and Shin Meguro, two unlikely friends. Yuusuke pretends to be cheerful and fun-loving, but in reality, he is uninterested in many things and people. In contrast, Shin acts cold and distant, but can secretly be quite caring.

Yuusuke proposes to Maria that she should put a "lovely spin" on the things she says to make her words sound less harsh, even if her message remains the same. Unfortunately, Maria cannot master this "lovely spin" when speaking, but people seem to be touched by her voice when she sings. Can singing help Maria convey that she is lonely, that she wants to be liked by others—and most of all—that she wants to be able to like herself?
