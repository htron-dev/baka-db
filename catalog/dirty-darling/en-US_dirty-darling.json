Having struggled with his sexuality for years, Shouji throws himself into his work to distract himself from the rejection, but when a young homeless man called Hama shows up at the shop, Shouji finds himself curious to learn more about him and, hopefully, befriend him. Attempting to make their way in a society that labels each of them as \"dirty\" and \"outcasts,\" as they grow closer the two men find they have more in common than either of them could have anticipated.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
