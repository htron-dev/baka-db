But the two girls have a secret: Miyoko is a vampire always thirsty for Saki's blood, and Saki is a vampire hunter who has had enough of being teased!\n\nIt's Saki's mission to kill vampires, but which will really enter Miyoko's heart first—a wooden stake, or Saki's growing affection for her?\n\n(Source: MU)",
