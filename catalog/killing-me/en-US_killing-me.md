## Sinopse

To their classmates, Fujimiya Saki and Kujou Miyoko appear to get along pretty well. But the two girls have a secret: Miyoko is a vampire always thirsty for Saki's blood, and Saki is a vampire hunter who has had enough of being teased!

It's Saki's mission to kill vampires, but which will really enter Miyoko's heart first—a wooden stake, or Saki's growing affection for her?
