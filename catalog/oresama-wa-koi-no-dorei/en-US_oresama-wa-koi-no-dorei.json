Takatsuki refused to accept Suou’s rejection and insisted staying over at his house to be his slave. However, Suou asked him to leave because Takatsuki couldn’t strike a balance between schoolwork and doing his slavery duties. What should he do to get Suou to look at him?\n(from Attractive Fascinante)",
