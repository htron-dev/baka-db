## Sinopse

Takatsuki thought that Suou sensei was the only one who was compatible with a top student like him. Takatsuki refused to accept Suou’s rejection and insisted staying over at his house to be his slave. However, Suou asked him to leave because Takatsuki couldn’t strike a balance between schoolwork and doing his slavery duties. What should he do to get Suou to look at him?
