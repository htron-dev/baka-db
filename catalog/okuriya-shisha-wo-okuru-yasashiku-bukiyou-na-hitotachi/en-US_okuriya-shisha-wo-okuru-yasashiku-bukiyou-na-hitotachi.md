## Sinopse

Segawa Takumi is a young man who used to not involve himself with others. He wasn't like that when he was little, but changed with adulthood. As soon as someone around him was showing too much interest toward him, trying to pray into his past, he would immediately change his address and work in order to reset everything. And above all, he used to keep his mouth shut about that little something he was able to do, and that no one else around could. Not that anyone would believe him anyway. It would just make others ostracize him for being creepy.

Because Takumi can see ghosts, and freely talk with them as well. Forget about the misconception that ghost are full of hatred or other ill feelings. They aren't. They're actually often nicer than they were while they were still alive, as if dying and being liberated from their body washed away that kind of things, only leaving some lingering feelings stopping them from moving on.

But isolating himself from others is no longer an option. Takumi is now a new employee in a company where everyone is like him. They use that little something others don't have to work for insurance companies and police behind the scenes, asking the ghost directly for the circumstances of their death, unofficially leading the cases toward their rightful conclusion. And also, part of the pride of this job is to help those ghosts to pass on after they completed the insurance company or police request.

As a new employee, Takumi will have to learn from his seniors how to understand them, and deal with their lingering feelings, one way or another. But can someone who rejected others for all those years really understand how they feel?
