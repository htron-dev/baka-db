## Sinopse

The plot revolves around a young Edo resident named Atarou who lives with his father X-gorou (read as Batsu-gorou) and runs the family store downtown. After his father's sudden death, Atarou must take care of the store himself and, along with the help of his father's ghost, his friend Dekoppachi, former yakuza leader Butamatsu, and a nutty alley cat named Nyarome, whom he protects from the tanuki-faced gang leader Kokoro Boss.
