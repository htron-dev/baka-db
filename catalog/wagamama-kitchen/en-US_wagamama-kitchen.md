## Sinopse

Handsome Kumaki hides a burning secret. This serious salary man appears to be quite the lady-killer, but in fact, he constantly finds himself head-over-heels in love with guys - straight guys! Kumaki\'s crush of the moment is on Naoto, a temperamental artist he met on his rounds as an office repairman. Will this be yet another disappointment in a never-ending series of heartbreaks? Or can Kumaki convince the doubting Naoto that true love lies within his embrace?
