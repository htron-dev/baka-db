## Sinopse

Having lived as a fighting legend in Busan, he wanted to live peacefully in Seoul. However, we all know that wasn't how Lee Jung Woo lived. Showing off immense skills in the fight against the best fighters in the school, Lee Jung Woo takes over the area in no time at all. After that, the gangs nearby never leave the "Tong" Lee Jung Woo alone. Although he is the "Tong," since Lee Jung Woo does not wish to bring harm to those not involved, he starts changing the way he lives. What exactly was Lee Jung Woo trying to protect through all that violence?
