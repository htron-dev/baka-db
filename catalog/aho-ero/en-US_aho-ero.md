## Sinopse

The ordinary and weak-minded Sakaguchi spent everyday with the talented cook and thoughtful ikemen Takato attached to him. The two roommates have a physical relationship that resulted from watching an AV together, and Takato's sexual requests begin to escalate day by day. Nowadays they bathe together and kiss passionately like lovers. But one day, Takato went out to a mixer, and recently it seems as if he's gotten a girlfriend. What are his intentions?
