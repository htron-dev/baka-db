Interestingly enough, the game presents an alternate version of his city...\n\nThe next day, when he returns from school, he finds one of the characters he had created in the flesh and blood (or, more accurately, cables and iron). She tells him there is some interference between the real world and the \"Iron World,\" and that he must now go up against the very villians he created himself.",
