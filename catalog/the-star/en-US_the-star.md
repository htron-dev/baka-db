## Sinopse

Nagase Yuuya always gain the highest test score in the school. One time, he got the 2nd rank and missed the chance to be an exchange student to go to the USA. His friend is frustrated and said that Yuuya is intended to do this to help another people that wants to study abroad.

She then handed him a sheet of paper, an announcement from the movie production saying that they need Yuuya to have a 2nd round audition for their new film. It appeared that his friend sent his picture to the judges without him knowing it for the first place. Yuuya is however, doesn't want to hurt his friend's feeling so he go there and expect that he'd fail the competition anyway. The road to Yuuya's life in show business is about to start.
