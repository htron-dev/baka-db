## Sinopse

Tricia works at a coffee shop for now, but she dreams of starting her own business—a pet salon. The problem is that the bank doesn't want to finance her dream. But then a mysterious man walks into her coffee shop and introduces himself. His name is Lassiter Dragan, and he's a well-known venture capitalist! He tells her not to miss this chance and promises her a loan if she'll agree to play his wife over the holidays. Tricia knows this is the way to make her dreams come true, but a man that charming is dangerous! She's hesitant, but she decides to go along with his suggestion. Could this be the start of a Christmas miracle?
