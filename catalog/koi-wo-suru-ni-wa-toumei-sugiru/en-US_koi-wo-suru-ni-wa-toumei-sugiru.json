    "sinopse": "Kazuya, the manager of a hair salon, is a gay man who enjoys impersonal flings with no strings attached. One day, his childhood friend pressures him into taking on an assistant beautician—although he rejects the troublesome idea of having men in the workplace, he relents when he hears that the assistant in question is \"Miki-chan\"... but he turns out to be a man with drop-dead gorgeous looks?!\n\n(Source: Media Soft, translated)",
