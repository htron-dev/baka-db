## Sinopse

Himari Uehara, for a first-year high school boy, knows very little about sex. Without his father at home and having skipped health in middle school, Himari is only confused when he wakes up with his boxers a mess and has no one for advice. Luckily, Himari has Gaku Asada, a new friend from high school who offers to teach him everything and more he missed out in health class.
