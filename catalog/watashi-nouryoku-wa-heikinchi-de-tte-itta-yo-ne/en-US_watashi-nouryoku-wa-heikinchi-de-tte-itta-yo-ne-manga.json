    "sinopse": "When she turns ten years old, Adele von Ascham is hit with a horrible headache—and memories of her previous life as an eighteen-year-old Japanese girl named Kurihara Misato. That life changed abruptly, however, when Misato died trying to aid a little girl and met god. During that meeting, she made an odd request and asked for average abilities in her next life. But few things—especially wishes—ever go quite as planned.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
