    "sinopse": "Shunpei Crowther's grandfather, Alsyd Crowther, was an odd man. He traveled around the world always coming back to Japan to tell his grandson all the amazing adventures he would have. Before leaving to Africa on Shunpei's 7th birthday, he gives him a teddy bear named Hyde. Six years have passed and one day Shunpei receives a mysterious package that contains a deadly surprise. To survive, he will learn more about his grandfather than he ever dared to dream and learn what it takes to be a real man, and not the coward he always thought it was all right to be.\n\n(Source: Endless Youth & Co.)",
