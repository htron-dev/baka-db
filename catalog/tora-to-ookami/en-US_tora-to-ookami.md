## Sinopse

The series started as a 60 page one shot in the December 2009 issue of Betsuma, but was later serialized starting on February 13, 2010.

Mii is a BL (Boys Love) fanatic who helps her grandmother run a family restaurant. Her monotonous life is turned around when two beautiful college boys come to eat! One is the kind Tora, and the other is the snotty Ookami, who refuses to eat the restaurant’s food.

More than boy troubles, Mii needs to save the restaurant from corporate big-shots who want to renovate the area!? And what role will the boys play in this!?
