## Sinopse

Ambulanceman Mikoto has a special ability, that is to see the last moments of any person he holds hands with. With such an ability, Mikoto foresees the death of his step-sister, Sara, whom he also loves as a lover, but he can only watch over her fate and await the moment he loses his love... It is now only 1 year away from her death.
