## Sinopse

High school student Kukuri is the third thief with the name "Umesato" and she feels she has pretty high standards to uphold. With her partners Niki and Maruo, Kukuri works hard at thieving, less so at school and always seems to come out behind in the final count. When another group of thieves helps themselves to her bounty, it's simply intolerable.
