## Sinopse

1. Kitsune to Atori
   This is a tale of human and fox, of Atori, who hates lies, and of her sister, who lost one eye because of a fox.

2. The Doll's Girl
   Minori is a reserved girl who would rather be left alone to make clothing for her dolls. Kanae is a flashy, spur-of-the-moment type of girl who's always enthusiastic. When the two end up in the same hospital room, they become fast friends. But when a fight tears them apart, it'll take a lot to get them back together. Can a friendship truly be eternal?

3. Extra story for Yaeka no Karte
