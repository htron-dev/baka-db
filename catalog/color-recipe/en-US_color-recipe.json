    "sinopse": "Shoukichi is a stylist who struggles with being unpopular due to him being unfriendly and overly serious about everything. Fukusuke, a top stylist who is frivolous and sarcastic, starts working at Shoukichi's salon.‬‪ One night, Shoukichi lets Fukusuke stay over at his place because Fukusuke missed the last train. While Shoukichi is sleeping, Fukusuke climbs on top of him and pushes his dick in his face. Because of this perverted thing that Fukusuke does, Shoukichi begins to hate him more and more. However, as creepy things continue to happen to Shoukichi, his thoughts about Fukusuke begin to change...\n\nMaybe he's really a prince...?\n\n(Source: Cocobees)",
