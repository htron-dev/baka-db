## Sinopse

Yamada Hana's just moved to Tokyo, and her perfect debut falls disastrously flat. Not only do things at school start off bad, but her demon sister's sold her off to work for Haru, who seems to spend way too much time touching girls. If that weren't enough, Haru's gorgeous, and Hana has a strange condition where she breaks out in hives whenever cute guys touch her!
