## Sinopse

Kenji Sakuragi is a poor lawyer and ex-motorcycle gang member looking for an opportunity to boost his career. His chance finally comes with the nearly bankrupt and notorious Ryuuzan High School, referred to as "baka gakkou" (stupid school) by some. There, he sets up a special class that aims to prepare five students to take and pass the entrance exam of Toudai.
