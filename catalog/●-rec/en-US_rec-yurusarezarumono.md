## Sinopse

While going out to eat with his roommate Aka Onda, Fumihiko Matsumaru encounters Tanaka, a woman from his company's accounting department who had previously stood him up on a date. Dumped by her boyfriend just minutes before, Tanaka forces Fumihiko to drink with her, spurring Aka's jealousy.

After Fumihiko escorts a drunk Tanaka home, he ends up tending to her the entire night, leading Aka to become suspicious. How will Fumihiko clear up the misunderstanding?
