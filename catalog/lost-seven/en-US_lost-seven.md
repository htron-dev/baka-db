## Sinopse

Tanlou is one of the roaming Blair tribe: a stubborn lot who keep to themselves and frown upon interaction with "outsiders". He, along with six of his friends find a young princess from a nearby castle, wandering in the forest. She begs them to help her, but their help comes with a price. Tanlou is cursed by the head of his clan, and the seven men are banished. Still, they feel compelled to help her. The princess' name? Snow White. After a vicious battle to regain Snow White's kingdom that leaves the princess gravely injured, the evil queen unleashes her wrath, and the unthinkable comes to pass when two of the seven mysteriously disappear, leaving behind five bereft buddies who have no idea what has become of their comrades.

And thus begins the plight of Tanlou and his friends...
