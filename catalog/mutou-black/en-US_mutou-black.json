    "sinopse": "Wandering traveler Kurotsuki Yukiji goes from town to town enjoying the women, food, and culture each has to offer. He is the master of the Kurotsuki style martial art where instead of using brute force, it uses the aiki form where you use the opponent’s strength and manipulate their force against them. It focuses on settling the conflict without hurting both sides and harnessing the “bladeless soul.” Yukiji is traveling to perfect this style and trouble usually finds him although going by his outward appearance, he looks like a peace seeking man.",
