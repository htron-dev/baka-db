## Sinopse

Reira Yazawa transfers to a new school. She is surprised because her new classmates are very calm and obedient. She soon realizes that her new class is controlled by Jin Koumura—the most charismatic guy in school. Jin had come out with the idea of an arbitrary system that classifies the students according to their popularity. But when he offers Reira to join the leaders' group she starts to revolt and she swears to end this madness.
