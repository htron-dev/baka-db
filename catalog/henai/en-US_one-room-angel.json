    "sinopse": "There are a lot of things that Kouki doesn't have—no hobbies, no friends, no lover, no stable job, and no will to live. So when a random tussle with some kids gets him stabbed, he thinks maybe this is finally his ticket out of this crappy life. But just as he's about to pass out he sees a beautiful \"angel\"... How is Kouki supposed to cope when less than a month later, he's mysteriously healed, has astronomical bills to pay, and suddenly has the same beautiful angel as his amnesiac roommate?\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
