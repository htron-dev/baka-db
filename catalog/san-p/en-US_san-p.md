## Sinopse

Sizzling hot college co-eds: Reika, Sara, and Mizume, are looking for more than just a quickie from their men. Reika must contend with her boyfriend Naoto's demanding job and demand some attention for herself. When she catches him watching hentai, will it break their relationship or spics things up?! Mizume's boyfriend, Shuuichi, is the book-worm type, but he's tired of studying can she convince him that there are more important (and fun)things than books- and that a little bondage can go a long way? Sara is all free for love, but will this get her in trouble when she's caught double dating, or will the boys see it her way and try to win her over in the most naughty way?!! Three P stars three hot college co-eds in nine steaming short stories of love and lust. When they're not out getting it on, they're hanging out together and comparing notes! Do Naoto or Shuuichi, or any other guy really stand a chance against the wiles of these sexy women?
