Natsume came to the human world to look for his bride who is called Ameno Uzumi No Mikoto who turns out to be Amano Chizu himself. It is said that Ameno Uzumi No Mikoto is actually a Wife to the Natsume clan and that the only way the clan can make children is to make love with Ameno Uzumi No Mikoto.
