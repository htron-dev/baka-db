## Sinopse

In an unexpected turn of events, Haru transmigrates into the body of Reina, the villainess of an otome game.

As soon as she transmigrates, an event in which the villainess bullies the heroine starts. If she bullies the heroine just like the game, the only ending waiting for Reina will be one of destruction. This isn't the time to be acting like a villainess, I want to enjoy my life! That's what Reina decided, but the heroine and the game's love interests keep falling into trouble?!

This is the long awaited manga version of the story of the villainess aiming for a happy ending in an unprecedented isekai life.
