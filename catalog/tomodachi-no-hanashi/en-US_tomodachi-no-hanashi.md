## Sinopse

Moe is a gorgeous high school student whom others find difficult to get along with, as her blunt honesty often comes off as insensitive. However, after meeting Eiko Sakamoto, a plain but exceedingly gracious girl, Moe feels she has finally found someone who truly understands her. Ever since then, the two have been inseparable best friends.

Because Eiko has an exceptionally kind heart, Moe takes it upon herself to protect her because of how much she cherishes their friendship. With guys often asking her out, she immediately lays down a single rule: dating her means they must also spend quality time with Eiko. Though the affections of others may push them apart, the two girls refuse to falter and show just how deep their bond truly is.
