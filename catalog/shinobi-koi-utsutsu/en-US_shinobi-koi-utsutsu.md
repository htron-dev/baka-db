One day, Kaede accidentally cast a genjutsu (illusion jutsu) called "Meromero no Jutsu" which causes any guy within a range to fall head over heels in love with her! Now, she has to pick one of the guys she charmed to train together so she can pass her ninja exam. Trouble is, the guys she charmed are all popular guys in the academy!
