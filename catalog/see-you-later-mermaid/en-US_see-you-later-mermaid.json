    "sinopse": "Amidst the crashing of raging waves, two strangers meet by the oceanside, their eyes filled with loneliness. Tatsumi Higaki has always believed his voice to be a curse, an unwanted \"talent\" placed upon his shoulders: the power of compulsion. Fearing its consequences, he has resolved to remain alone forever. On the other hand, Kazushi Kimijima came to the sea in search of somethingâ€”or someone.\n\nAs the two men are put at odds, they are forced to confront their intertwining histories, and as their emotions reach a peak, the two are borne back ceaselessly into the past.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
