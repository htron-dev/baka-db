## Sinopse

College student Sano, who is curious about love but has never felt it, decides to go to associate professor Kigami, who's famous for doling love advice out to his students. When he's mistaken for a part-time assistant, however, Sano gets roped into cleaning the Archaeology department's room for Kigami instead. Impressed by his work, Kigami gives him advice in exchange for his trouble and suggests Sano be his teacher's assistant for real. But would his advice still successfully snag Sano a girlfriend, even though Kigami's only ever liked guys?
