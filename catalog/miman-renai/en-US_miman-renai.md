## Sinopse

Twenty-nine-year old Kurose Kazumi is a programmer in a eroge company and has played plenty of galge when he was younger, but he's completely uninterested in young girls. A chance encounter changes that when he meets a middle schooler who suddenly says she can't date him, but he realizes how cute she is and wants to keep her with him.
