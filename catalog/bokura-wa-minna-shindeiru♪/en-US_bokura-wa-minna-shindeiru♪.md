## Sinopse

"Love Game" rules:

1. All participants are already dead.
2. If you want to be resurrected, you must fall in love with one of the members.
3. Once the first couple have been established, it's game over for the rest of the participants.

Nine people with different genders, jobs and age were gathered together by "God," who informed them that they're already dead and were to play his "Love Game." One of the participants, Rin held doubts for the aim of this game and the true face of "God" and is now desperately trying to get to the bottom of everything.
