    "sinopse": "Since high school, Masaki and Rion have been best friends, and have lived together since adulthood. Their personalities are distinct opposites, but beneath the casual intimacy of friendship lie the unripened buds of Masaki’s feelings, unacknowledged by either of them.\n\nThe birth of a child of Rion’s ex-girlfriend and reminiscences with an old kouhai from school bring back memories of their shared past, both the public and the private. Will the feelings between them finally be allowed to blossom?\n\n(Source: Hero Scans)",
