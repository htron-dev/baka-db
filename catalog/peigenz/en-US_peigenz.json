    "sinopse": "At the beginning of the 21st century a sudden increase in genetic mutations cause some people to be born with special abilities. However, these enhanced humans are not welcome amongst the general population. As time goes by, they are marked for exile and shunned by society, resulting in a life of crime for many. As their special powers make them difficult to apprehend, the government joins hands with an unofficial, secret group of bounty hunters known as Peigenz. The Peigenz organization is filled with the most gifted and highly trained mutated individuals.\n\nJay Berell, the heroine of the series, is a normal high school student. During a battle between Peigenz and a dangerous serial killer, Jay find herself caught in the crossfire. This triggers her special mutant abilities and leads to her recruitment into the Peigenz organization.\n\n(Source: Infinity Studios)",
