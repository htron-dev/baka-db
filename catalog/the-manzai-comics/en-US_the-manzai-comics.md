## Sinopse

Determined to create the funniest two-man comedy team (MANZAI) around, Takashi Akimoto pursues his fellow male middle school student. the misfit Ayumu Seta. After cornering Ayumu, Takashi suddenly blurts out, "Please go out with me!" After desperately trying to reject him, Ayumu eventually finds out that Takashashi meant "Go out with him" as his partner in a Manzai Comedy duo. However, the more Ayumu tries to get away from the excessively confident and forceful Takashi, the more he finds himself sucked into a world of comedic mayhem!
