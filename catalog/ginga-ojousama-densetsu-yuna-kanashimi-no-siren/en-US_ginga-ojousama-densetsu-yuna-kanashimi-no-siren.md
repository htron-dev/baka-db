## Sinopse

Yuna Kagurazaka, a clumsy and sweet sixteen year old girl, had her life drastically changed when she won an intergalactic contest for the person with the purest heart. Now, she is an intergalactic superhero and magical girl known as the Savior of Light. She pilots the mecha El Line to maintain the peace of the universe. But Yuna’s entire world is shaken when she is wrongfully accused of destroying a city with El Line. She is captured and taken prisoner by Misaki Ichijouin, a special agent from the Galaxy Alliance. However, Misaki soon realizes that she has been deceived, and teams up with the rest of Yuna’s friends to free the Savior and save the galaxy before an evil force is restored to power.
