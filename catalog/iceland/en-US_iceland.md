## Sinopse

As an anecdote on any voyage, three enigmatic protagonists seek for a fourth character in an environment in which even the most everyday action (watching TV, fishing, sleeping, taking a taxi) will turn strange. A place to discover and decipher characters. These are the components of this visual adventure that is called Iceland.
