## Sinopse

A family and their maid are going about their daily lives when, unexpectedly, a woman bursts into their home shouting, "They're coming!" She then vomits out her organs, turns into a zombie, and attacks the master of the house. The maid saves her employer, but he and his daughter are stunned and have difficulty processing the events. As more and more zombies invade the residence, the maid decides it is her duty to defend the house from unwanted guests—using a chainsaw!
