    "sinopse": "Real Zama’s first and last love ended because a fortune teller said there was zero compatibility. A few years later, Real has become that very thing: a fortune teller. But, rather than taking advantage of poor wandering souls for their fat wallets, Real tells it like it is and has earned the reputation of being a harsh fortune teller.\n\nOne day, when a sickly looking Shoujirou Futami walks in and explains how another fortune teller had told him to drink a suspicious bottled substance called “Vital Hydrogen Water,” Real advises he go to the police and to stop drinking the mystery liquid before it’s too late.\n\nA month later, the transformed Shoujirou appears in front of Real to repay him for his help. Although his naivety and lack of awareness anger Real, he may be the only person to lean on when Real is in trouble!\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
