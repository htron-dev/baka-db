## Sinopse

Hachi, Kyuukichi's faithful dog, leaves Edo and heads for Ise Jingu Shrine to obtain a shrine talisman in place of his injured master. People called such dogs "sanguu dogs" and took good care of them.

In the Edo period, ordinary people dreamed of visiting Ise Shrine at least once in their lifetimes. Because it was difficult for them to actually make that pilgrimage, people sent their dogs in their place. Hachi is helped by all sorts of people on his journey, but he can't reach Ise. He doesn't know what Ise smells like, so he can't sniff his way there...

This is the delightful story of Hachi's journey, where Hachi must count on people's goodwill to reach his destination!
