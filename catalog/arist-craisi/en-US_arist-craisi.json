Since Gran is missing a heart, people called him the \"nameless monster\".\n\nElise then said to him \"Maybe you are the one that I've been looking for.\"\n\nElise herself is a \"Arist Craisi\" also known as a cavity demon. Her sole purpose to life is to hunt down other \"Arist Craisi\" and complete her revenge. A tale of battles between monsters, the beginning of the illusory yet melancholy dark fantasy!",
