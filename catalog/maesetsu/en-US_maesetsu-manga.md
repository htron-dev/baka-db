## Sinopse

Four 19-year old women—Fubuki, Rin, Mafuyu, and Nayuta—are trying to become comedians, diligently honing their routines while working part-time jobs. With the philosophy that "laughter makes people happy, and if everyone is happy, I'm happy," they aim to take the stage at the renowned Nanba Grand Kagetsu Hall. For now, they settle for working their way up from the bottom doing shows in Shibuya.
