## Sinopse

Lee Uh In's family has long protected a legendary jar of alcohol with mysterious properties. Anyone who drinks from it will gain immense strength--and swap sexual orientation as well! But the jar only fills every ten years, and everyone who's drunk from it previously has died soon after. Enter Ichiro Yachi, who's unfortunate encounter with the liquor has left him liking guys and determined to take the jar back. Divine swapping, alcohol and an ancient legend? Things are about to get complicated. [From BakaUpdates]
