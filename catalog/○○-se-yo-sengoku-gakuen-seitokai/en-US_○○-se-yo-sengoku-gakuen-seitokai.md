## Sinopse

This manga takes place in a school where the students are based on famous shoguns in Japanese history. Sengoku Gakuen was once like a normal school but Oda Nobunaga, the student president overthrew the teachers and practically made them powerless. He built a school of the students, for the students and by the students. Nobunaga eventually graduated and left Hideyoshi in charge as the student president. However, Hideyoshi soon drops out of school to help Nobunaga rule Japan as he ruled Sengoku Gakuen.

The story picks up here as there is a battle between Ishida Mitsunari, an uptight and conservative, yet hardworking boy, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, the temporary school president who has lots of followers, fighting for the school president seat. We also see other famous figures as fellow students such as Ootani Yoshitsugu who is loyally following Mitsunari and Oichi, Nobunaga’s younger sister. Who will win the student body president position and take command of the school?
