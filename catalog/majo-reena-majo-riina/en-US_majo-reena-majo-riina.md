Sorata is an everyday boy, who loves a girl called Futatsugi. When he was in elementary school he saw a girl in his dream, and on the very next day Futatsugi, who looked just like that girl, transfered to his school. Sorata holds on to that memory, but after he finds out about Futatsugi and what power she holds, can he still say that he's in love!?
