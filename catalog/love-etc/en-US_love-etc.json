    "sinopse": "LOVE, ETC. is a sensual anthology that proves that a boy in love can never avoid true love and desire--no matter how valiantly he tries!\nTake Uchida and Hiro. Hiro tries to ignore the torturous crush that he has on his younger co-worker, because Uchida is dead-set on getting a girlfriend. To Hiro's surprise, it turns out that they both need to come to terms with the attraction they have for one another.\nThen, there's Segawa and Honda. Honda is terrified that Segawa might realize the pent-up feelings he has for the boy . . . but even Honda never prepared himself for just how boldly Segawa might behave on an impromptu jaunt on a motorcycle!\nWhat about Maki and Tatsumi? Stuck in a relationship with the dominant, obsessive cosplayer Maki, Tatsumi is frustrated. But are his claims of wanting a life free of his lover really true?\nThese couples, as well as others, in LOVE, ETC. are about to realize that it's impossible to deny fate--or passion--for very long.
