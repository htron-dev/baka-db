## Sinopse

Two years ago, detective Tetusuo Kanoo and his assistant were working on a case known as the "Dream World Serial Kidnappings." The mission was a total failure, with six out of the seven missing children found dead, and the assistant inspector working with Kanoo going completely insane. When his condition led him to commit acts of serious violence, it was Tetsuo who put him down. Living with the guilt associated with the unsolved case and the death of his own assistant, Detective Kanoo retired from the police force.

Nowadays, Tetsuo lives his life scandalously. After obsessing for years over the mysterious figure known as "Red Hood" —the probable perpetrator of the kidnappings—his resolve is growing weak. However, when he is lured to a hotel by the lecherous detective Kairi Amane, Tetsuo finds himself tricked into returning to the Special Police Force.

There has been a sudden spike in the usage of an enigmatic and extremely dangerous drug known as "M," and the police suspect that Red Hood has returned. Partnering with Kairi, Tetsuo once again finds himself on the trail of the depraved criminal that has haunted him all this time. But with the return of the sole Dream World survivor, the memory of the assistant he once killed, and the burning suspicion that Kairi is not all that he seems, Tetsuo isn't sure he will be able to stay sane.
