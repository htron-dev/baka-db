## Sinopse

Kaori is a diligent student striving for complete victory and dominance in the art of kendo. Having endured pain driven exercises as a child and being witness to her brother's defeat in a tournament, she has put all her focus and effort into training herself to be the best. So naturally, being second nation-wide in the junior league doesn't sit well with her. And when Kaori is suddenly defeated by an opponent she can't render as either an amateur or a genius, she faces an obstacle that leaves her no choice but to cut it down mercilessly.
