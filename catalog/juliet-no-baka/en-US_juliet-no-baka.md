## Sinopse

"Loving you isn't enough."

Ruka (omega) and Taisei (alpha) are mates. They don't live together and only meet when Ruka has his heat. When the sex is over, Taisei would hurry up and go home, and Ruka ends up unable to say the words "don't go!" Juliet no Baka is a painful love story about a couple unable to be honest with each other and their twisted relationship.
