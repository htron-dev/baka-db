    "sinopse": "Addy Edson was looking for a husband, and she knew just the guy to help her with her search. But what she hadn't expected were the warm, sensuous \"practice kisses\" that her childhood friend Joe Barrington was bent on giving her --or the way they made her feel...\n\nJoe was more than happy to help Addy find a groom, especially since it meant the redheaded beauty would be practicing her sexy charms on him! But how could he convince her that a lifetime of happiness --and nighttimes of passion --could be found in his arms?\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
