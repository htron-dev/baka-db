    "sinopse": "A series of unsolved murders have the entire neighborhood scared, when one night, middle schooler Majima Yuuichi observes two figures from his window, resembling his classmates Izumi Kiruto and Matsuda Ryuuji, near the most recent crime scene. Confusion turns to horror when Izumi turns into a monster, and though he tries to convince himself that this incident was only a dream, Majima cannot shake off his fear, and starts avoiding them.\n\nTwo years on, now in high school, Majima is horrified to find that he has ended up not only in the same school as the two popular boys, but also in the same class. But is there really more to the two wrestling-fanatical, somewhat idiotic new friends than it seems?",
