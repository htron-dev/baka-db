## Sinopse

Yoshiya thinks it's fate when he's reunited with his first love; however, he learns they can never be together... For middle-aged scriptwriter Makoto and beautiful actor-in-the-making Yuu, it's a chance meeting in which admiration turns to love, and love turns to doubt...?! A young and heartrending adolescent love story and a bittersweet mature romance.

The stories of a group of men who mingle, intertwine, and change.
