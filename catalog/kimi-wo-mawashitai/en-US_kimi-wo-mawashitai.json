    "sinopse": "One day, a tiny girl named Shina appeared inside a roll of toilet paper in the Yamaguchi's residence toilet. She made a stunning impression on a typical middle school student, Nobuo.\n\n\"What if I use up all of the paper? Would I be able to see her... na... na... naked?!\"\n\nIt's the beginning of a story about love, lust and... a sh\\*t ton of other adventures!\n\n(Source: Wydawnictwo Kotori, translated, edited)",
