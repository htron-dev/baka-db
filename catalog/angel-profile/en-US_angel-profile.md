## Sinopse

Long ago, the kingdom of Astrea was threatened by a powerful, evil dragon. With two legendary swords in hand, the traveling knight Julius defeated the dragon and saved the country. It is said the hero lived happily ever after with the queen.

However, the writer Elliot knows that isn't the truth. With its last strength, the dragon cursed the hero Julius, causing him to forget all his previous knowledge, experience, and memories. Following the dragon's defeat, Elliot discovered a lone, small form left on the battlefield. His adored hero had been reduced to a helpless child. Elliot swears to restore Julius to his former glory and tell his tale.
