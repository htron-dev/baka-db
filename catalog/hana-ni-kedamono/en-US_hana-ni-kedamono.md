## Sinopse

That was the first time I fell in love. The first time I met "Hyo-kun", time stopped and I could not breathe. My heartbeat became louder and I could not take my eyes off of him. Although Hyo-kun told me "he wants to be with me", he is a guy who has kissed many girls. This love has many difficulties... it's tender yet painful, but even so I can't stop my feelings for him. I'm sorry...I fell in love with a "beast". This is my first love.
