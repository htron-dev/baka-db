Araki, who is a veteran editor for the dictionary department, is looking for a successor now that he's approaching retirement age. After Majime Mitsuya—a salesman who's a poor talker—meets Masashi Nishioka—Araki's coworker who is sociable and frivolous—Araki overhears their conversation and decides to recruit Majime into the department. The story follows \"the awkward humans\" Majime and Masashi as they work together to compile a medium-sized Japanese dictionary titled \"The Great Passage\" (Daitokai).\n\n(Source: ANN)",
