## Sinopse

Amano Chiyako is an oni who tore off her horn and chose to live in the human world. One day, two little gods, Kou and Haku, appeared in her apartment and started to live with her. Having no horn, they didn't realize Chiyako is an oni—the natural enemy of gods—and treated her as a normal human, causing her a lot of trouble through their divine purifying powers and love towards sacred items.
