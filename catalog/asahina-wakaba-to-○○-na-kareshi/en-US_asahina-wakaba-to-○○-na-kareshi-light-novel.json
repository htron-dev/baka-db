    "sinopse": "Wakaba Asahina is a shy and slightly awkward girl. She is coerced by her classmates as a punishment game to confess to Haruto Iruma, the number one most hated boy in school. Though her relationship with Haruto starts out with an air of gloom for Wakaba, her depressing school life is dyed with color when she discovers that they share more in common than what she thinks.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
