    "sinopse": "After losing a bet, Tao Nozomu's baseball team is forced to dress up as cheerleaders and cheer for their rivals, the Titans. However, after the bet is all settled and done, Nozomu finds he likes crossdressing almost as much as he likes baseball. Despite interior conflict with such desires, he tries to give it up; but one day, he discovers he's turned into a girl?!\n\n(Source: MU)",
