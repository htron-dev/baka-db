## Sinopse

Berry Shirayuki is a cheerful and optimistic 12-year-old girl who has just been accepted into a private girl's school after studying hard for her exams. Aside from friendly but unwanted comments from her next-door neighbor Tasuku Meguro, it seems as if nothing can go wrong for this newly-made middle schooler! After the first day of school ends, Berry is saved from tripping over stairs by a blonde-haired boy, and ends up following him to Café Mew Mew in hopes of thanking him. While in the cafe, Berry accidentally stumbles upon a shining statue that projects visions of a cat and rabbit—who enter her body just before she metamorphosizes into a white-costumed magical girl with bunny ears and a cat tail!

Following a series of strange incidents which lead her to discover amazing hearing and jumping skills (as well as a craving for carrots), Berry realizes that she has become a new member of Tokyo Mew Mew—a group of magical girl superheroes with both animal-like and supernatural abilities! Berry needs to take her new responsibility as a protector of the peace seriously, because she is now a target for Tokyo Mew Mew's new enemy... and they are on the hunt for some fresh rabbit.
