## Sinopse

Often seen as silent bystander, the eldest son of the Naruse household is about to embark on his own journey of love. Raita is the epitome of success and incomparably handsome but he’s largely a mystery to those around him. With a bully and a pervert for siblings, what can we expect from the self-confessed virgin?
