    "sinopse": "Akiyoshi Tooru is the perfect student with glasses. Unfortunately, he's always been told that he was 'cute' and 'pretty' which forced him to develop an inferiority complex as a young man. The very same Akiyoshi received a confession from a boy of rare beauty, Naruse Fuuta. Of course, Akiyoshi rejected the confession from another man. However, Naruse lost it, underwent a complete change of attitude, and attacked him! Now knowing the fearsome nature of Naruse, what fate awaits the fleeing Akiyoshi?!\n\n(Source: Blissful Sin)",
