    "sinopse": "Fourteen-year-old Shichiri Tasuke is your ordinary junior high school student—well, sort of. His life is a little lonely since his family has left him alone at home while they go travel the world over, only occasionally sending letters and postcards.\n\nThis lonely and uneventful life is shaken up the day Tasuke receives the magical Shitenrin ring from his father in China. From out of this ring appears Shao Lin, the Guardian Angel Getten. She proclaims that she is here to protect her new master from all forms of danger and will stay by his side forever.\n\nBut having been locked in the Shitenrin for hundreds of years, Shao knows nothing on the modern world. Sometimes it seems she causes MORE problems than she solves. Now, Tasuke must learn how to handle this beautiful, naive and magical angel.",
