## Sinopse

When his mentor is injured, novice linguist Hakaba is appointed to take over the professor's research in the Netherworld! Though Hakaba has studied the languages of werewolves, lizardpeople, and other Netherworld races from afar, this will be his first field experience coming face-to-face with those so many of his fellow humans have dubbed "monsters." Guided by Susuki, the professor's half-werewolf daughter (?!), Hakaba begins his quest for a greater understanding of the ways people of the Netherworld communicate-even if it does get a bit...hairy at times...!
