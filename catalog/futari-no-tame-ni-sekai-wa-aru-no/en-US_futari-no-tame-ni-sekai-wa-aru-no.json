That naturally makes Chiharu and Kyou bitter rivals as well, but the relationship they hesitate to flaunt in front of the public eye is one of... lovers! They even have sex at hotels and are an average (!?) couple!!\n\n(Source: ShoujoMagic)\n\nIncluded one-shots: Valentine Cinema, Joou-sama no Okiniiri (The Queen's Favorite)",
