Their meeting will prove to be more than a coincidence, though, as it becomes clear that Il-Geum is quite possibly the man Jih-Ro has sought. Together, the two begin a new journey and a new rivalry. As the stakes are heightened through kidnappings, deceit and magic, trust becomes a distant memory, and the two begin a feud that could ultimately lead to death, or worse…
