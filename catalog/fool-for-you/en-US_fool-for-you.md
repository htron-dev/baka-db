From Bushido Angel Adventures

Sou has a habit of taking in stray cats. Recently, however, a strange guy has been following him around. He's told the guy is a new transfer student to their school, Furuse, and he's really weird. But Sou has a strange feeling when he looks in Furuse's eyes, like he's trying to remember something important.
