    "sinopse": "Naoki Sakura has just arrived at an all-girls high school, ready to teach a class of first-year students. The spirited homeroom teacher states his goal of building genuine relationships and offers to help them with any issues they might be facing.\n\nNevertheless, three particular members of Naoki's class have rather unique personalities: Yuna Sakurai is a melodramatic klutz who inadvertently reveals her underwear, Minori Hinomoto boasts inhumane strength, and Shizuka Aoi is a blunt and, at times, aggressive lesbian.\n\nThe students—each with their own peculiar troubles—often land Naoki dealing with a myriad of wild and uncomfortable situations.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
