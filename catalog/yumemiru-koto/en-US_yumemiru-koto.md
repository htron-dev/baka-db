## Sinopse

Princess Olga has been putting off her marriage for a long time by setting her suitors to impossible tasks and requiring rare gifts. What she loves most of all are magic objects and one day she discovers a bracelet which allows her to slip into a different world. That world seems to be very different from hers, but it turns out she had more in common with the bronze-skinned princess Abed than she originally thought.
