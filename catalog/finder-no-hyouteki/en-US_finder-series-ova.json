    "sinopse": "Twenty-three-year old Takaba Akihito is a young freelance photographer who takes pride in his work and seeks to get a major \"scoop.\" After he takes photographs of the business dealings of crime lord Asami Ryuichi, Asami kidnaps and rapes him, beginning a sadomasochistic relationship between them as they find themselves continually drawn to one another. Fei Long, a rival Chinese boss who blames Asami for his father's death, takes an interest in Takaba, as well, seeking a way to get revenge.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
