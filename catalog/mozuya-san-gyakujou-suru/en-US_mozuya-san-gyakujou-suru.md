## Sinopse

Mozuya Koto is afflicted with the medically accepted disorder known as Dr Josef Tsundere's Bipolar Personality Disorder, or just "tsundere" for short. With her golden hair, blue eyes, twin tail, and being rich on top of all that, Mozuya Koto comes equipped with all the basic necessities of being a top class tsundere. When Mozuya wants to be friends with somebody or when she likes somebody, she will take offensive actions that are completely opposite from what a normal person would actually do in the same situation and it is completely outside of Mozuya's control. The manga is pretty serious most of the time, focusing on Mozuya's troubles with getting along with people as she keeps turning violent due to her tsundere disorder.
