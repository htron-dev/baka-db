## Sinopse

Mugi Asai is an extremely shy girl, so shy that she becomes tongue-tied and even passes out when she has to speak in front of even a few people. Upon entering a new high school she is unwittingly pressured into joining the Drama Research Society, and due to the low number of members must act in a number of roles over the year.
