## Sinopse

Long ago, the Emperor possessed great mystical powers. Now, a young boy wonders if he will have them as well.

With no memories and only a rose-shaped scar on his forehead as a clue, he ponders his legacy while on the run with the girl who rescued him from a group of armed warriors. She takes him to a scientist who identifies Rose as the Emperor's clone and believes that this young boy must assume the mantle of leadership. But opposing forces with their own agenda have created another clone from the Emperor's DNA...and now the struggle for power begins!
