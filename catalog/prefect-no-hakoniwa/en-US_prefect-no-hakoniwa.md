## Sinopse

A twist of fate leads to Mioto Sakura attending a dormitory school for society's elite. Bullied by his peers for being a "nouveau riche"—a commoner—Mioto endures his school life with stoic indifference. Unable to sleep one night, he wanders the dorm grounds and stumbles upon a chapel. There, he befriends the mysterious and beautiful Tsukihito Touin. The next day, Mioto finds himself being chosen as Tsukihito's protege, a position coveted by everyone around him...! A dramatic romance surrounded by school rules and caste systems begins to bloom!
