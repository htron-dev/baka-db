    "sinopse": "One day at the sorcery academy in the borderlands, the impoverished student Avis is forced to fight against a genius at the academy. If he does not, he faces immediate expulsion. Everyone believes it will be impossible for him to win. Raising his blind and frail sister all on his own, Avis has endured the necessary training to receive a scholarship. However, without achieving this goal, he collapses from exhaustion.\n\nAt that time, he witnesses a strange dream; in it, he walks in the shoes of the legendary grand sorcerer using \"Time Sorcery,\" a magic that was once used to defeat the demons. However, that magic has not been since that fateful time long ago.\n\nAnd after Avis awakes from the dream, he realizes that the legendary Time Sorcery is his own?!\n\n(Source: Square Enix, translated)",
