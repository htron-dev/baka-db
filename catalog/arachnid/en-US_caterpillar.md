## Sinopse

Possessing both flexibility and tenacity, Imomushi (Japanese for Caterpillar) is an assassin that does not kill anyone but those who are assigned to her. She seems to have had something happen to her and her older sister in the past, however.

A new spin-off story from the same author of Arachnid, this story looks at the inner workings of a top assassin within The Organization itself.
