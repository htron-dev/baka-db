## Sinopse

Alice Fujii still isn't having much fun. She survived an assault of psychotic bug-themed assassins at her school, but all the battles, the truth behind her family, the two betrayals from false friends who ended up dead and the loss of her Kumoito knife-gun took a toll on her mental state. As such, she spends her days alone splitting open the heads of the rapist zombies who overran Japan since the aforementioned incident. The organization wants to hire her as their new boss, and elsewhere her allies Gokiburi and Kabutomushi are looking for her. What will become of all this?
