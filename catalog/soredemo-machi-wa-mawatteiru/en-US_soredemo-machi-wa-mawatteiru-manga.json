    "sinopse": "Clumsy Arashiyama is a girl with a love for mysteries and a knack for getting into trouble. She works for an old lady's lackluster maid café in a small shopping district. The cafe is largely unsuccessful in attracting customers aside from Sanada, a regular and one of Arashiyama's classmates (who has a secret crush on her). One day Arashiyama's clever friend Tatsuno is invited to the café, and, upon seeing the miserable state of things (and Sanada, whom she has a secret crush on), decides to work there. Don't miss the crazy antics of Arashiyama and friends, mismatched love stories, and all the hilarity that is created as a result, in Soredemo Machi wa Mawatteiru.\n\n(Source: MU)",
