## Sinopse

Tomoki is in love with his senpai, Sawaki. One day while at Sawaki's house, Sawaki's brother, Atsuya, catches Tomoki jerking off while smelling Sawaki's shirt. Afraid Atsuya will reveal his secret, Tomoki avoids Sawaki. Four years later, Sawaki is getting married and Tomoki is invited to the party. Tomoki's "love" for Sawaki is still as strong as ever, but another person has his eyes on Tomoki—Atsuya. Will the younger brother of Sawaki be able to conquer Tomoki's heart?
