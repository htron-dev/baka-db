## Sinopse

Is it a pillow?!?!....no, it's a CAT!! One night, 22-year-old Moe took in the ever-so pillow-like cat, Poyo. No doubt, Poyo not your everyday cat (doesn't look or sound like one!), but that doesn't stop Moe, her family, friends, and neighbors from loving the adorable spherical cat!! Ru Tatuki brings you the perfect amount of humor and warmth in this delightful feline 4-Koma manga!!
