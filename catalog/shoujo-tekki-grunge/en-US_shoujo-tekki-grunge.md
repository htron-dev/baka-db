## Sinopse

One day, a group of school girls who have been leading peacful lives, encounter and face their complex destinies.

In the 22nd century, a brain implant called VL makes all daily life much easier and more convenient. However, some people can't use VL, and a small group of those people are kept in a special class in school. One day, the mother system goes mad and begins to take over the minds of the VL users, even remaking their bodies into dinosaurs or other monsters. The small non-VL group discovers their own transformational talents, and learns what they must do in a world that's rapidly gone out of control.
