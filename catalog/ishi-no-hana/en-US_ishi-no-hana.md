## Sinopse

Here again is a work of Sakaguchi which demonstrates (if there is still any need) the immense talent of this author. This time, he's produced a historical manga, which unfolds in Yugoslavia during World War II... It's not especially happy, and I fear things will not work out in the end.

    Increasingly fascinating. This takes the form of a grand mosaic with five or six principal characters. Not at all Manichaean [seeing the world in black and white, lacking nuance], full of sensitivity.
