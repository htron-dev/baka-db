## Sinopse

Now you too can learn the secrets! This mock-instructional tome is actually a hilarious parody in graphic-novel form of those books which seek to advise one on "how to draw manga". Now even a completely untalented, artistically uninclined novice such as yourself can learn what it takes to properly use a pen, create characters, license ancillary rights for anime and toy manufacturing, and become rich, famous, and sexually potent beyond one's wildest dreams.
