## Sinopse

A life that can be redone now. Standing next to me is the man who once killed me.

Celebrating the founding of the proud Kingdom of Hailland during the "Star Festival Night." Drowning in unfulfilled love and turning away from national affairs, Queen Alicia was supposed to have died with a sword pierced by a revolutionary man who had boarded the castle. When she wakes up, Alicia is 10 years old. She will lead a life of redoing, remembering that she was killed. During that time, she reunites with Clovis, the man who once killed her...?
