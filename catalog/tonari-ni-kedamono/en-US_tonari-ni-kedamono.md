## Sinopse

Three young men have been friends for the past 20 years. Kanato, an average guy who owns a family business, has had feelings for Sora, a cheerful young man with an unlucky past, for the past 10 years. Afraid that this can change their relationship, Kanato has been hesitant about confessing for a long time and ended up confiding first in Shin, a handsome business man. Although he finally musters up the courage to declare his feelings, before he gets the chance to confess to Sora himself, a different confession dissolves all his expectations and everything changes.
