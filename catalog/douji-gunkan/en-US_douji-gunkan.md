## Sinopse

Fei is a gnome, a race of small stature and high intelligence. With the promise of freedom, he works until dawn to read and translate the mysterious ancient documents that have suddenly appeared from another world. That is how it should have been, however, a turn of fate sets him on a path of revenge.
