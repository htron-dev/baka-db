    "sinopse": "Ever since Jun, a third-year middle-schooler, moved from Tokyo to a rural town his life has been boring. The only way he blows off steam is by shooting a gas gun at an abandoned love hotel called \"Nocturne.\" There, he encounters four other kids the same age, including a school crush named Saki. After faking a UFO sighting on a whim, the five decided to band together to pull similar pranks around town. However, things gradually stopped being all fun and games.",
