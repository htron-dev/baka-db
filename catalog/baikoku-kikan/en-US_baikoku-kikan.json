    "sinopse": "In the early 20th century, a small republic found itself stuck between a kingdom and an empire—both of whom wanted to manipulate the republic to suit their own needs.\n\nIn order to protect itself from both sides of the conflict, the republic created a small group of soldiers whose job it is to suppress revolution and dissent in any way possible. This is the story of the Opera House.",
