    "sinopse": "Hanaka has never stayed at any particular place for too long because of her grandma's crystal ball. After hearing the news that they'll be packing their bags again, she cried herself to sleep. During the night, she heard a sweet harmony and dreamed of sleeping in a flower bed. The next day, as she was on her way to say goodbye to her friend, a trio appeared and identified her as \"Princess Hanaka.\" They demanded the Laga Star, which she had no clue about. At the same time, a guy with silver hair and aquamarine eyes appeared confessing his love for her. (Source: Esthétique)",
