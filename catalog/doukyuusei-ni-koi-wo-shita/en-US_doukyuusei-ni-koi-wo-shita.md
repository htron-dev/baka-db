## Sinopse

Sunao is a female high school fresh man who's extremely scared of boys. She hoped that it'd get better in high school, but the cool and reserved boy next to her, Izumi, only seems to make it worse. And by some weird coincidence, the two ended up training for an upcoming soccer match together?!
