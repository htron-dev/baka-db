    "sinopse": "To seek a quieter and happier life as an ordinary high school girl, Tsubura's just moved from a big city to her grandmother's house in the countryside. On the first day at her new school, she gets through an awkward introduction to her class, when, an errant baseball shatters the window from outside. To everyone's surprise, Tsubura leaps into action, catching it and whipping it into the mitt of the pitcher below. Her rather acrobatic catch-and-throw makes boy students get down on their hands and knees and beg Tsubura to join their school's baseball team. Although the boys have tried to get into the division championships, the team is too weak. For Tsubura, baseball is exactly what she wanted to avoid, so she flat out refuses to join the team. Will Tsubura bow to peer pressure and ultimately take the pitcher's mound?\n\n(Source: CMX)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 3: Yawaraka Teikyuu\nVolume 4: Wappa!!",
