## Sinopse

One day, on the roof of the old school building, Shuuichirou Hayakawa and Ryouhei Konno meet by chance while skipping class. Over the next three months, after repeated encounters in this same space, the two strike up an incidental friendship.

Konno has a reputation for being intimidating and difficult to speak to, but he is surprisingly forthcoming about his love for photography. Hayakawa envies the fact that his friend does not have to hide or make excuses for his passion. Although Hayakawa is always singing under his breath absentmindedly, he appears to have an aversion to music, and this contradiction piques Konno's curiosity. For how long can he keep pressing for answers before his questions push Hayakawa too far?
