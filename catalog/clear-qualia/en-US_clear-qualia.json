    "sinopse": "In a distant Island, people suffer from a strange disease called \"Pinocchio\". This disease causes patient's limbs to rot, and before long, leads to death. But disease can be cured by using artificial limbs or \"exchanging\" limbs of people with special antibodies. These people with the antibodies, who only exist one in ten-thousand, are called \"Doner\", and their bodies considered national treasures. One day, Dorothy, a Doner, exchanges her precious right eye for a male Plastica(robot servents) who was about to get thrown away. Their meeting sparks the beginning of a story of a strange master and her strange Plastica.\n\n(Source: MU)",
