## Sinopse

After Akira Warabi's accidental death, his guardian angel, Rarirarurara, places his soul in a stuffed wallaby made by his classmate Kokoro Kokosa as a memorial tribute. Kokoro agrees to let Warabi live in her bedroom while he waits to be returned to a human body. Rarirarurara decides this will not happen quickly, as Warabi seems to be happy where he is.
