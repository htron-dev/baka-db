## Sinopse

Editorial newcomer Yoshi knows that his fast-paced career is bound to be full of surprises, but he never planned on meeting one of his favorite authors at a book release party! When the talented writer Orito Suga shows up with his shy brother Masato, Yoshi is deeply touched by Masato's lonely smile...and his sweet, sparkling eyes. Stress and looming deadlines soon force Yoshi to move in with the temperamental Orito. Will the young editor get the full story behind these strangely inseparable brothers, or will he be kept in the dark for good?
