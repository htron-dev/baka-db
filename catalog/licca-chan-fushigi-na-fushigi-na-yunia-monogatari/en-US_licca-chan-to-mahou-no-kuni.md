## Sinopse

Takara Tomy's popular doll "Licca-chan" got it's own animation "Licca-chan and the Magical World" produced by DLE Inc.

This time the theme is a telephone, based on Licca-chan's (Rika-chan's) phone, and the story has elements that capture the girls' hearts such as Magic and Becoming a Princess.

As supporting characters there's the vivid colored "Bear", a humorous take on princess as "Ann Queen" (voiced by Asa Komuro) and other original characters, creating an original scenario.
