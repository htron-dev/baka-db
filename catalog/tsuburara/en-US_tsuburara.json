    "sinopse": "Suzuoki Tsubura is an ordinary high school girl who has an obsession with the girl idol group Caramel Angel. She's a little embarrassed of the extent of her fascination, particularly because she doesn't seem like the kind of girl who would fawn over idols. In the privacy of her own home, though, she blissfully hangs out in her Caramel Angel postered room and never misses their music performance on tv.\n\nThen, on one unlucky day, she accidentally breaks her family's TV. Her mother is in no rush to replace it, and Tsubura doesn't have the money to do it herself. How will she overcome this terrible crisis and get her fix of Caramel Angel?!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
