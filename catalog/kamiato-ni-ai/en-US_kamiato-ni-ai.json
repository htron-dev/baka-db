    "sinopse": "Shino and Kazuto are employed as detectives in a police organization that is part of the island country Sakura. The two have known each other since they were children, but during the last few years, Kazuto has been acting strange. Rumors of Kazuto being obsessed with Shino have formed within the jurisdiction. After requesting to be transferred to the same department as Shino, and forcibly getting involved in an investigation, he kisses Shino and pushes him into getting into a sexual relationship with him! Shino refuses, saying it's impossible, but he's unable to completely reject him as all of the time they'd spent together gets in the way. This time, the two have been assigned to carry out a joint investigation together, but...?\n\n(Source: Kaiohsha, translated)",
