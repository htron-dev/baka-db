But that's not his true nature (maybe).\n\nAs he continues his (misguided) quest to learn about himself, he meets his classmate Chigusa Somei (a monster with a desire for 120% approval) and discovers the dangerous depths of philosophy!\n\nThe wheels of adolescence are now set in motion for two people with mutual interests...!\n\n(Source: Takeshobo, translated)",
