## Sinopse

Ginpei Ebisawa is considered a delinquent. But that's not his true nature (maybe).

As he continues his (misguided) quest to learn about himself, he meets his classmate Chigusa Somei (a monster with a desire for 120% approval) and discovers the dangerous depths of philosophy!

The wheels of adolescence are now set in motion for two people with mutual interests...!
