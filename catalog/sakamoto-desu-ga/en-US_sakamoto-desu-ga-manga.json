    "sinopse": "High school student Sakamoto is the definition of perfection. Good looks, intelligence, athleticism, kindness—he has it all! Everywhere he goes, all the ladies love him and all the boys are mad with jealousy. No amount of tricks or traps can ensnare Sakamoto as he evades and outmaneuvers his critics with ease; not even a male model can stand against his cool and collected demeanor as he glides through life with grace and elegance. Whatever situation he's in, Sakamoto will overcome anything in absolute perfection.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Katahaba Hiroshi (Broad Shoulders Hiroshi)",
