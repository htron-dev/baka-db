## Sinopse

The god Yomi and the robotic maid Miko. This pair crosses to innumerable "ended worlds," passing along their funeral rites; it's a strange experience. Even so, the traces of those who once lived are all beautiful remnants to the god and the maid. Endless endings untold, this is the heartwarming story of two travelers, whose funeral rites bring a close to one tale after another.
