## Sinopse

Matsumoto Serika has just moved to the big city and is looking for an apartment. She doesn’t know much about this place, but it’s spring so what could possibly be wrong? She meets a woman in a kimono outside a very large house named Sakuragawa Suzune and they hit it off. Later that same day Serika is bemoaning that she hasn’t found a place to live when she runs into Suzune again, and Suzune suggests that Serika stay at her home. Serika accepts.

Only one problem that she’s about to discover, that Suzune is one of three MEN living in the house…
