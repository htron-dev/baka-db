## Sinopse

Guy has some "precious book" with some "wonderful pictures" that he can't show to anyone... The reason being, most of his college friends can't really understand his "tendencies."

Of course, we wouldn't have a story if the guy didn't go through some life changing encounters (all thanks to that very same book).
