## Sinopse

Animated to the song ‘Manatsu no dekigoto’ (Midsummer Happening) by Miki Hirayama, the film is a playfully erotic animation with appropriated images that include Marilyn Monroe, Mickey Mouse, Superman, Roy Lichtenstein prints and the Glico chocolate icon of a man running through the finishing line of a race. Screened at the 3rd Animation Festival at Sogetsu Art Center in the same year that Tanaami participated in the exhibition ‘Watashi no Marilyn Monroe’ (My Marilyn Monroe) at Gallery Décor, Tokyo.
