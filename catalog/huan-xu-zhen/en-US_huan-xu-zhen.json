Waiting for you to open it again, and tell me you love me.\n\nJiang Ziya returned home to find that the single child in the family had become two and no one seemed to notice.\n\nZiya has a strange left eye, one that could see what others couldn't. Most of the time, he would ignore it but this time something abnormal is happening in his home. He couldn't possibly turn a blind eye to this, could he?\n\nThere is no peace in this world.\nSome dangers require just a 'glance'.\nIn the face of unknown, do you choose to see - reality?",
