## Sinopse

Open the box to give me light, breath life into me, hold me with your love... then forget about me.
Master, I miss you.
Master, I love you too.
Master, do you remember?
I'm still lying in that box waiting for you. Waiting for you to open it again, and tell me you love me.

Jiang Ziya returned home to find that the single child in the family had become two and no one seemed to notice.

Ziya has a strange left eye, one that could see what others couldn't. Most of the time, he would ignore it but this time something abnormal is happening in his home. He couldn't possibly turn a blind eye to this, could he?

There is no peace in this world.
Some dangers require just a 'glance'.
In the face of unknown, do you choose to see - reality?
