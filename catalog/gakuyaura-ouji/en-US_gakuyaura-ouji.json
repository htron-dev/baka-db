    "sinopse": "News of the handsome and famous Kabuki actor, Ryuusei Horiuchi reaches the ears of Akari but she has no interest in checking him out when all she wants is to meet the one who truly loves her. Just when she declares this statement she accidentally injures Horiuchi, who silently glares at her before leaving. Later on in the day, she finds a black cat, which she follows right into Horiuchi's Kabuki theater. Guilty for causing a bruise on the actor himself, Akari volunteers to become his assistant until it heals. While Akari initially dislikes Horiuchi's silent and cold personality, her feelings begin to change as she remains by his side.",
