    "sinopse": "When Jack, a wartime field medic, decides he's seen enough of war and leaves, he gets more than he bargained for: his travels take him through the mountains, where he meets a young, winged boy! After nursing him back to health, he realizes the child must be one of the 'bird-folk' of legend. Though they soon become friends, the rest of the boy's tribe isn't so quick to accept the human... in fact, they want him dead!\n\n(Source: Amazon)",
