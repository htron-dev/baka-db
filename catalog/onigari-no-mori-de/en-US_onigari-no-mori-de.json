    "sinopse": "Misono Kazuki is a college student pursuing a dream of becoming a famous novelist—but unfortunately, for someone trying to pen a supernatural YA novel, he’s got next to no experience with close encounters of the spiritual kind. To remedy this, at the suggestion of a friend, he heads to a supposedly haunted shrine late one moonlit evening, and while he doesn’t find any ghosts, he does find something much more interesting.\n\n(Source: September Scanlations)",
