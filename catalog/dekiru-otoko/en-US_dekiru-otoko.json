    "sinopse": "Sagishima Takehiko, Hokuto's distant benefactor throughout his growing up with foster parents, is a successful executive. When Hokuto turns 20, he appears in his life in person and turns it upside down in order to groom Hakuto as his successor. But is that all he is, a benefactor? Hokuto wonders whether he might not have a secret reason for his kindness to a supposed stranger. But when he finally gets to ask the question he has pondered all his life, the way Sagishima responds is ... surprising.\n(from B-U)",
