## Sinopse

There's a well-known saying that everyone living in the palace needs to know in order to survive: "If you see the Queen, you absolutely must avoid her!" Although the Queen is amazingly beautiful, she is a jealous woman. An uncountable number of people have fallen prey to that vicious and cruel person. However, all of the Queen's evil deeds were done with only one goal in mind—to hear the Emperor confesses his love and make her his Empress.
