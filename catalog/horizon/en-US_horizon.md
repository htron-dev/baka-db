## Sinopse

It is the 12th century, and the Steppes of Mongolia are home to a never-ending battle for supremacy. The scattered tribes of the land battle day after day, constantly fighting for dominance. However, these days are fated to change; a powerful man is set to rise up, unite these tribes, and aim for world conquest.

Temujin, son of Mongol tribe leader Yesugei, is one of many who lives for the thrill of battle. However, the boy stands a step above others. Prodigious in combat and possessing a unique aura that defies authority, Temujin inspires awe in not only his allies but his enemies as well. Horizon follows the exploits of the young Temujin as he is led on a path to change the Steppes and become Genghis Khan, one of the world's greatest conquerors.
