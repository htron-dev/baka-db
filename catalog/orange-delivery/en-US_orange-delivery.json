    "sinopse": "Through middle school, best friends Miho Shirokawa and Miho Yoshii bowled together. But since Yoshii has moved to a high school in Hokkaido, Shirokawa just hasn't enjoyed bowling like she used to.\n\nOne day Yoshii calls to talk about her interest in a new sport—curling! Yoshii's high school curling team has decided to try to make it into the next Olympic winter games. Shirokawa thinks about quitting bowling and joining a curling team as well, but unfortunately, there isn't one at her high school. At least, there isn't until Shirokawa accidentally sells the idea to a former figure skater, Rin, and her friend Endou.\n\nBefore she realizes what's happening, Shirokawa's has become the founding leader of her school's Curling Club! How will she face all the difficulties of starting up the team, when she only has the vaguest idea of what the sport of curling is even about?!\n\n(Source: MU)",
