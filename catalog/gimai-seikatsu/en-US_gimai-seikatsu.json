    "sinopse": "After his father's remarriage, Yuuta Asamura ends up getting a new stepsister, coincidentally the number one beauty of the school year, Saki Ayase. Having learned important values when it comes to relationships between men and women through the previous ones of their parents, they promise each other not to be too close, not to be too opposing, and to merely keep a vague and comfortable distance.\n\nOn one hand, Saki, who has worked in solitude for the sake of her family, doesn't know how to properly rely on others, whereas Yuuta is unsure of how to really treat her. Standing on fairly equal ground, these two slowly learn the comfortable sensation of living together.\n\nTheir relationship slowly evolves from being strangers the more the days pass. This is a story that may lead to love someday.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
