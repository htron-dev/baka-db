## Sinopse

Produced as a short experimental trial series of only 3 episodes and filmed in black and white. Inspired in part by the novel "Deep Range" by Arthur C. Clarke, the tale of an undersea boy (Dolphin Prince) with a pet dolphin, who swam in a wetsuit with a built-in jetpack and stunned his enemies with an aqua-boomerang. The episodes featured his mermaid friend Neptuna and Dr. Mariner, with stories entitled "Secret Of The Red Vortex", "Call Of The Sea" and "Attack Of The Sea-Star People."
