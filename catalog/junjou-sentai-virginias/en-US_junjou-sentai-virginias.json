    "sinopse": "Junjou Sentai Virginias: a special squadron that gain powers by retaining their innocence. With a qualification as specific as this, it can be expected that this squadron mainly includes young boys and girls. All except for one person: Red, a soon to be 33-year-old man. He has been unpopular for many years, and thus decided to leave romance behind in the pursuit of justice.\n\nDue to the requirement of retaining one's innoncence, it is often common that members come and go. Today once more, Junjou Sentai Virginias welcomes it's new member, Pink. However, she is unlike the other members: she's actually 28-years-old, and is slowly developing feelings for Red! Despite that, everybody thinks she is still a minor, having lied about her age. In a squadron where purity must be maintained, how will this slowly developing love progress?\n\n[Written by Phloup]",
