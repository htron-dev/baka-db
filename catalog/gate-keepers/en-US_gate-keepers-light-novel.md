## Sinopse

The year is 1963 and the earth is in danger; Invaders are plotting to infiltrate Earth and wreaking havoc when they appear. Normal weapons have no effect. Mankind's only hope are the "Gate Keepers", human beings with the ability to wield incredible psychic powers. Shun Ukiya is one such Gate Keeper. He was leading a normal high school life, but those days are over - If the Earth is going to stand a chance he, and other Gate Keepers just like him, are going to need to band together and fight.
