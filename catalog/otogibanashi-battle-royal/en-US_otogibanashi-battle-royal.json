    "sinopse": "Kuninaka Aoba is the target of bullies at school and wishes for nothing more than to be on good terms with her classmates. Her wish is granted, but at what cost? Suddenly, she's thrust down a rabbit hole, into a strangely familiar world from children's stories–only this version comes with a dark and gruesome twist. It's kill or be killed, in a fairy tale fight to the finish!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
