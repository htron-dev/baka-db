    "sinopse": "Half-beasts and humans both live together in this world, but species don't usually mix romantically...\n\nIori is a social worker who helps half-beasts live with humans. He's got a good heart, but he's scared of love. One day he meets the wolf writer, Tsuneaki Gora, in order to introduce him to the orphan wolf boy, Riku. Iori immediately feels something for the wild and hot Tsuneaki, and Tsuneaki seems to like him, too... or, at least his scent, anyway...!!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
