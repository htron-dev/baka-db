## Sinopse

Despite the personality clashes and the conflicting self-interests of each member, the Information Management Club seems to be managing swimmingly well. So well in fact, that the group has managed to claim top spot during the athletics meet. Of course, all would be perfect if the prize for said athletics competition wasn't to come under the direct control of Great Place High School's student council!

The student council president and vice-president are notorious for being manipulative and sadistic. And both will use any means to get their way...what could they possibly want with the Information Management Club?

This "sort-of" spin-off series of Great Place High School delves deeper into the intricate relationship of "Sir" Student Council President Rin and "Sir" Student Council Vice-President Eichi. Plus, Minami, Tsuru-sempai, Kuma-sempai and the rest of the Information Management Club provide much needed comic relief in between. The GPHS family just got bigger. And wackier.
