    "sinopse": "Iizuka's gay, and unfortunately for him it's an open secret among his co-workers, who all but whisper about it the second he turns his back. Even worse, he begins falling for his new boss, Takase--at least until they go out drinking one night and Iizuka wakes up the next morning with no memory of what happened.\n\nChapters 3-5 are about a man (the one Iizuka almost slept with in chapter 1) who is on a search for love and then he bumps into a little girl and takes her back home to her father who might just be his destiny.\n\n(Source: MU)",
