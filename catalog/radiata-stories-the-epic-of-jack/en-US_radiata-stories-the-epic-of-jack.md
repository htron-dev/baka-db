## Sinopse

In the center of the world lies the human kingdom of Radiata. People throughout the land sing of its glory. Sharing the world with the humans are the fairy creatures. Dwarves, elves, goblins, and others all lead their different lives. Although they are not exactly friends, humans and nonhumans live side-by-side in harmony.

In a small village, a young man named Jack lives with his sister. Dreaming of becoming a great knight like his father before him, he ventures forth one day to join the famous Royal Radiata Knights. But the fragile peace between humans and fairy creatures threatens to shatter... where exactly does Jack's destiny lie?

This is Jack's Side of the story. Based on the homonymous game.
