## Sinopse

Inugami is the kind of tsundere, cool type of boy...despite that, his true feelings are always too obvious! He's from a traditional family which worships the old dog god, and he was born with dog ears and a tail which both expose his emotions.

And so begins a romance comedy about a high school girl who's bad at dealing with dogs and Inugami!
