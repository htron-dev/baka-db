## Sinopse

Midorikawa Ryuusei has just become a member of the superhero team Giga Squad. He's always looked up to superheros, but his position as Giga Green means that he has to follow the orders of Giga Red, which he fails at miserably. What will he and the rest of the Giga Squad do when Giga Red suddenly becomes a shut-in?
