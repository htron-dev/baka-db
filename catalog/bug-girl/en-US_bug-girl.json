    "sinopse": "In very rare cases, people suddenly change in strange ways without warning. This phenomenon has become known as \"Body Unknown Gestalt,\" or \"BUG\" for short. In response to the dangers caused by people affected by BUG, the government created a special combat unit of modified soldiers known as Cheater. Kiko Ayane is a brand new high schooler who feels to urge to go to the bathroom during the entrance ceremony. But right as she's relieving herself, she bugs out, and causes the school to explode! Her life is about to get a lot more complicated now that the entirety of Cheater is out to get her!\n\n[Written by Denji]",
