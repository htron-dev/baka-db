## Sinopse

"The golden coin of destiny..., it is the golden gate that connects humans and non-humans. Obtaining this is the goal, and around the world, demons and ghosts have appeared and become involved in the world of trade. Now then, tonight as well, the sound of someone knocking on Babelheim's door can be heard...

Welcome to a bizarre but fascinating world of gothic horror that peers into the darkness of human hearts."
