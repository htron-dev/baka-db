    "sinopse": "It features Kawashima Minami, who becomes a manager of her high school's baseball team. She's determined to see her team make it to Koshien (the national high school baseball tournament), but the players don't share her enthusiasm. They see the tournament as an unrealistic goal and are content for their club to focus on physical fitness, making friends, and building memories together. To learn more about management, Minami ends up buying \"Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices,\" a book written by Peter Drucker, an Austrian expert on economics and management. She finds that the respected, over 30-year-old text actually gives a lot of information that she can apply to managing her baseball team!\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nThis series is on hiatus.",
