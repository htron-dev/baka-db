## Sinopse

Fumizuki Mai just recently moved into town and is starting her new life at school. She soon realizes that the curriculum is really weird, consisting of body fitness classes, undressing classes and extreme combat training. Mai soon realizes that her school is really a location for girls to become the most incredible women on Earth. She meets four girls who are weird but nice in their own way but their craziness and the ridiculous classes just might make Mai go crazy.
