Despite this, he has two secrets which have not yet been let out into the world. Number one: he has a male lover. Number two: he is an extreme masochist. With those secrets noticed by the creepy and wild movie director Edagawa, will they be let out to Ryuutarou's beloved boyfriend, Maki...?\n\n(Source: Kagerou Scans)",
