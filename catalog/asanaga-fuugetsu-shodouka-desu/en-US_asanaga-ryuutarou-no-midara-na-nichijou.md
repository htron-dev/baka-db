## Sinopse

Asanaga Ryuutarou, the successor to a floral arrangement family, has a severe but overly beautiful appearance. Despite this, he has two secrets which have not yet been let out into the world. Number one: he has a male lover. Number two: he is an extreme masochist. With those secrets noticed by the creepy and wild movie director Edagawa, will they be let out to Ryuutarou's beloved boyfriend, Maki...?
