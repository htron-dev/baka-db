    "sinopse": "A narrative of self-discovery masquerading as a coming of age romance, a family composition drama, a procedural detective story, and a superpowered thriller. Sakuta Minami openly professes the many loves of her life: Matsumoto Leiji anime, her family, swimming, Magical Plastering Girl Buffalo Koteko, but the unanswered questions surrounding her mother's separation from her natural father have nagged her all her life. Moji Shouhei, an anime geek with prodigious talent for calligraphy, holds in his gifted hands both a physical key to the school roof of their high school as well as the figurative key to finally unraveling the mystery of Minami's father.\n\n(Source: MU)",
