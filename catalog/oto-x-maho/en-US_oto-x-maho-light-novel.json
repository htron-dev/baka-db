    "sinopse": "One day, ordinary junior high-schooler Shirahime Kanata is forced by his mother, Konata, to sign a contract that transforms him into a \"magical girl\" in times of trouble. As a magical girl herself, Konata wants to pass her job onto her son so he can protect the peace while she goes on vacation. Unfortunately for Kanata, canceling the contract means he'll permanently change into a girl, so now he's stuck doing an embarrassing job. Along with the help of his supervisor, a perverted cat named Moel, Kanata will fight against the \"Noise,\" a magical enemy who try to disturb the peace...all while wearing a cute skirt!\n\n(Source: MU)",
