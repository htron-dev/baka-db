## Sinopse

"My father's last words were a curse, binding me even after his death."

Genkyou is a city-state ruled by status and comprised entirely of nobles. Crime and underhanded deals seem to be an everyday occurrence and one in which many turn a blind eye. To fulfill his father's dying words, Iori travels to Genkyou determined to do whatever it takes to extract his father's revenge. However, their may be more to Iori than meets the eye.
