Russell, a boy who makes his living off of chasing whale-squids in the oceans off of the land nation Liberistan, meets a strange entity called Liv in the depths of the water. Using Liv's power to greatly increase the control over a Yunboro, Russel is determined to succeed in life in a safe land.

Sukaya, the daughter of the cabinet minister of the opposing nation Augustonia, was exhausted from her days in which her efforts would not bear fruit. However, her situation changes when the humanoid robot Ignite awakens and chooses her as its pilot.

A boy who holds hope for the land, and a girl who seeks freedom. And so, a new story begins to move in the various lands that the giant ship Gargantia travels to.
