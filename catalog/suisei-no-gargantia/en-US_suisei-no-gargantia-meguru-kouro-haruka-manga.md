## Sinopse

Ledo is living his new life with his companions aboard the Gargantia fleet, and he works diligently as a member of the salvage team working to recover bits and pieces of the previous age of human civilization. Reema, a girl who used to be a part of Cugel's fleet, then appears. Reema now studies under Amy as a messenger. After Ledo and Reema meet, Ledo reflects on his former life in the military and how the life he lives now aboard the Gargantia is completely different. Ledo is also awaiting the difficulties and crises that he knows the future will bring. With his bond with Chamber engraved on his heart, Ledo faces his future in the sky and in the sea.
