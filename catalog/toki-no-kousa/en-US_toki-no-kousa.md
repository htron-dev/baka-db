## Sinopse

A four-dimensional short anime will start at the very beginning of Shibuya Crossing, that is, 10,000 years in the past.

The anime is part of a collaborative project helmed by Yoshitoshi Shinomiya. It features a hybrid of animation and live-action. The short was screened on Shibuya's Crossing screens and a YouTube-friendly version was posted as well.
