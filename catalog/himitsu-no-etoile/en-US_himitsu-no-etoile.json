    "sinopse": "All high school student Makoto wants is to be a normal girl. Unfortunately, with her manly face, this feat proves to be about impossible. In Elementary school, she played Romeo in Romeo and Juliet. In Junior High, she had a fan club consisting of all the school's hottest girls. In High School, she is known as \"Prince.\" The fact she is 180cm tall does not help her out. However, the final blow comes when she finally musters the courage to confess to the boy she's liked since Middle School, only to be rejected and accused of not being a real woman. Dissolved in tears, a beautiful-looking Prince appears in front of her, leaving behind a handkerchief and business card. Visiting the address on the card, the cafe \"Etoile\", Makoto is then asked to work there... dressed as a man?! She wants to be a girl, but what kind of situation has she gotten herself into?\n\n(Source: MU)",
