    "sinopse": "When Kaede sees a historical piece of ukiyoe art by a mysterious artist named \"Gengo,\" she is transported back in time to 1860. In this time, Gengo is an unpopular ukiyoe artist, one who is especially fond of sleeping with and drawing erotic pictures of prostitutes. When he hears rumors of a mysterious clairvoyant woman, he quickly plans to meet her, draw her, and sleep with her. That mysterious woman is Kaede, who has built up a reputation using her future knowledge of the historical period. Having found Gengo, she is determined to maneuver him into drawing the art that she knows exists in the future, in the hopes that it will help her return home.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
