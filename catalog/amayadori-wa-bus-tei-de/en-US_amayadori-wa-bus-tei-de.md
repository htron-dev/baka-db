## Sinopse

This whole incident started with a phone call from Ikushima's younger siblings in a bus stop, where he had the most unfortunate luck of meeting happy-go-lucky boy. Ariie. Ikushima may look pretty, but his seemly bad and cold attitude gave him the nickname "queen." Even though he doesn't think he's wrong (actually what he say seems right, justified even) but his good intention is always taken the wrong way. He blames it on his extremely serious look.

Stumbling upon the queen's soft side, Ariie used the information to his advantage and started following poor Ikushima. Will love blossom from this seemingly weird pair...?
