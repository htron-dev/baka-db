## Sinopse

On the very first day that innocent country boy, Oyamada Kouta, transfers to a city high school, the prettiest girl in school asks him to meet her alone. They meet in the music room, all alone. Her shining hair and entreating eyes! Her flushed cheeks! Her sweet lips! Her... fox tail?!!

Who is this mysterious and alluring girl and just what does she want with unsuspecting Kouta?
