## Sinopse

"Kitamikado-kun, this is a Dating Game. And falling in love...means becoming a slave."

Mikado Kitamikado fell into a trap set by Kisa, the daughter of the Nanjou family that controls the underside of Japanese society, ending up at her mercy. Following that, he was presented with a "Heart-stealing Game," where admitting your love meant losing.

For an aspiring politician like Mikado shouldering the future of Japan, on top of having a fiancee, scandals were a strict taboo. Their futures being at stake, he challenged the game with a do-or-die spirit, but Kisa's advances repeatedly chipped away at his reason. And that was to be expected—he was in love with Kisa, after all. However, it was much the same for her too...

A sugary dating game of dirty schemers starts now!
