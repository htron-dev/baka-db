## Sinopse

Ryou had a sleepover and saw his friends, Issei and Tadahiro, kissing while they thought he was asleep. He asks them about it and feels betrayed as a childhood friend when they pretend nothing happened. Determined to catch them red-handed, Ryou ends up inside a closet with Issei's little brother Yuusei, who has a unexpected reaction to the situation.
