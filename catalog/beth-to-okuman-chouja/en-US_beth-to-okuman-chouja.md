## Sinopse

Beth winds up on a date with young, wealthy businessman Todd after he participates in a charity auction. She can't believe that she, a widow living with kids in the suburbs, is going out on a date with a notorious playboy. Gentlemanly Todd picks up Beth in a limo and treats her like a queen, but she feels uncomfortable in his high-class world and ends up leaving in the middle of their date!
