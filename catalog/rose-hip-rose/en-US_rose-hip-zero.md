## Sinopse

Appearances can be deceiving. There is trouble in Tokyo as a mysterious terrorist organization called ALICE plots against the government. Just as the police are tasked to bring these men to justice, they are given a "secret weapon": a young girl with a mysterious past named Kasumi Asakura. She may look innocent, but she walks softly and carries a big gun.
