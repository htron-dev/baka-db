## Sinopse

The biggest problem in Serina's life is her appearance. She has perfect proportions, long blond hair and bewitching lips. However, she's shy, so it doesn't make her happy. Instead, it only attracts men who think she's easy. One day, she reunites with Aaron at the restaurant where she is waitressing. He was her first love who saved her when they were students. However, now he has the aura of someone successful and he looks her up and down with interest... He says to her, "Every man wants you even if you don't work for it."
