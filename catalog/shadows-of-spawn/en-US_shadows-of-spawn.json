    "sinopse": "Ken Kurosawa, also known, unfortunately, as Double K. Ken is a savvy street thug with a heart of gold. While he may be a crook, all his earnings go to caring for his ailing sister, Mariko. But Ken's rubbed the wrong people the wrong way and dies rather horrifically in a car bomb. As with Al Simmons, who is referenced several times in this first volume, Double K makes a deal with the devil. He'll trade his soul just to be with his sister again. As with any deal with such nefarious creatures, Ken finds himself \"alive\" again seven years later. Dressed in a bizarre costume and sporting incredible power, Ken has a new role to fulfill, that of a Hellspawn. A number of questions are raised about Double K's purpose as a Hellspawn and the possible redemption of the wicked. But like the original Spawn the questions are left unanswered in favor of action and comedy.\n\n(Source: MU)",
