## Sinopse

This is the story of the characters from the anime Shirobako in their high school years, told from Ema's perspective.

Ema Yasuhara is a shy, withdrawn girl. She loves to draw but... she's not confident in herself. That was when Miyamori Aoi saw her art and asked, "Let's make an anime together!."
