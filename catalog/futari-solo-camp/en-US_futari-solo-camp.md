## Sinopse

Gen Kinokura loves camping solo. He enjoys the quiet solitude away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and being able to appreciate nature all by himself. But on one camping trip, his solitude is broken by the appearance of Shizuku Kusano, a young woman who wanted to camp solo herself, but is ill-prepared and completely out of her league. While he tries to to get her to go home so he can camp in peace, she refuses, and stubbornly insists on accompanying him on future camping trips until she's ready to camp solo. Thus Gen and Shizuku's days of solo camping together begin.
