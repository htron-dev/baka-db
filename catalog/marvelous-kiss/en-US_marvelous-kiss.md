## Sinopse

At the start of his difficult journey to find a bride, the Strega (witch) young man named Noah was accidentally kissed (through CPR) by the popular male student, Mattis, due to some circumstances and turned into a girl! This phenomenon is called "Marvelous Kiss." If an unmarried Strega kisses someone of the same gender, their gender will be changed into the opposite one. But, despite the gender change, Noah recklessly approaches Mattis to learn how to be popular! Will Noah ever be able to find a marriage partner at this rate...?!
