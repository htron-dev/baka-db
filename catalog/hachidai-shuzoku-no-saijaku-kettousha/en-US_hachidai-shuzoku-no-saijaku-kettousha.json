    "sinopse": "Long ago, there was much war and bloodshed among the eight tribes of the world. Now with each tribe confined to its own continent, the world has achieved peace and harmony. Interaction and fighting between tribes are heavily restricted, save for one exception: the ninth continent, Duel City Babel, an arena for those wishing for conflict in peace. In the duel city, fighters from all over the world clash swords and spells, vying to be the best.\n\nCarrying on the teachings and techniques of his master, Yuri Eniastar of the Human Tribe manages to take out a high-ranking opponent on his first day. Clearly, he's not just any new face, but unfortunately, fate has not been kind...his lineage is universally recognized as the weakest. Despite this, Yuri refuses to give up. He befriends the Beast Tribe's Athena and the Spirit Tribe's Fram as he strives to become a peerless duelist.\n\nWelcome to an overwhelming battle fantasy!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",
