    "sinopse": "Fujioka Tsunami is a middle school girl with a personality that packs a punch just like a tidal wave. She’s very outgoing and positive but at the same time, oblivious to many things, including her busty body. Tsunami goes on mini adventures with her friends Sanae, Kana and Yuuki just like any teenage girls would do.\n\n(Source: MU)",
