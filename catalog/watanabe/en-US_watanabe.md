## Sinopse

Watanabe, an alien student from 20,000 light-years away, comes to homestay with the Tokino family to gather material for his thesis on Earthling behaviour. He follows around the various family members asking mostly funny but sometimes profound questions about their work, their loves, their polluted air... When he's not being sent on errands or punched in the face, at least.
