    "sinopse": "Shirakawa Yui is one of the most brilliant junior youth soccer players in the country. The players of the junior youth team are recruited from a young age and trained to become a professional player and even some will be the next soccer superstar. But when the company sponsor of the team goes bankrupt, Yui and his teammates, Naria and Urata, find themselves without a team to practice on. His two friends completely dismiss the school soccer team as the competition is laughable, but Yui finds something in a troublemaker named Genya. Eventually, all three of them join the school team and build it from the ground up only to find that there is incredible talent hidden. Will Yui, nicknamed the soccer magician for his ability to manipulate the playing field, be able to compete with the top schools in the nation?\n\n(Sorurce: vyc)",
