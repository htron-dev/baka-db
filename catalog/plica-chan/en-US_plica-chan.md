## Sinopse

Plica-chan is the bittersweet, realistic story of Plica, a young lesbian looking for love in modern Japan.

The manga, which is written in 4-panel strip style, originally ran in Anise magazine, and now runs in the LOUD News, the newsletter for the LOUD organization. It can also be found online. Plica's comments are often on the nature of sexuality, the relationships between men and women, and between women and women.

The whole strip starts on a low note, as Plica returns from an ex-lover's wedding. But not too long into it, Plica meets Mari, for whom she starts to have feelings pretty soon.
