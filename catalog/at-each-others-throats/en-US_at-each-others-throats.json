    "sinopse": "The daily adventures and harsh realities of real siblings.\n\nFull of the minor annoyances and disgusting behaviors that form the solid foundations of any self-respecting sibling relationship; twins Bok and Baek are professionals at this comedic double-act business. Pranks are played aplenty and pettiness level is at maximum, both at school and at home.\n\nExpect exaggerated reactions and bitingly poisonous word battles. But will there be sweet moments too, the hallmarks of idealized siblinghood?\n\nYou will have to read on to find out.\n\n(Source: Lemon)",
