    "sinopse": "Sanpei is strict, abrupt, and far too serious for his own good. His friend and co-worker, Tani, is outgoing, flashy, and slightly airheaded. When Tani is forced to quit his job and take over the family business, he’s determined to take Sanpei back with him – as his wife! Sanpei’s liked Tani for a long time, but will the overly-serious Sanpei let Tani into his heart, or will he end up pushing Tani away before things go too far?\n\n(Source: DMG)",
