    "sinopse": "In search of props and costumes for a school play, two girls wander into a dilapidated warehouse. Opening a door, they encounter a room overgrown with weeds and reeking of peppermint. In the center of the room, atop its very own throne, sits a beautiful black dress. Both girls want to try the dress on and begin to fight each other, unaware that something sinister hides mere feet away.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
