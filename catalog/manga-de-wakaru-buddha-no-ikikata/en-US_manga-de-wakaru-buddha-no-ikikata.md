## Sinopse

What is happiness? What's the point of living the way I do, day in and day out? Twenty-five hundred years ago, in his youth, Buddha (Shakyamuni) had the same nagging questions that we do today. He never avoided them or gave up the search for answers, but devoted himself earnestly to discovering the meaning of life. That search is the starting point of Buddhism. Precisely because he agonized more than others, Buddha also attained a happiness greater than that of anyone else. In our desire to live with strength and good cheer, the life of Buddha is sure to provide invaluable insight.
