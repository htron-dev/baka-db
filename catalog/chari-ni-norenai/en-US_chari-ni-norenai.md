## Sinopse

But my sense of balance is so bad that I can't... That's the trauma that high schooler Tsubame Ogawa has had to bear up under all these years. But starting when he meets naive rich boy Wada and joins the Bicycle club, he gets bound up in the terrifying world of cycling! Can't Ride a Bike is a youth lifestyle comedy with a bunch of ridiculous young men!
