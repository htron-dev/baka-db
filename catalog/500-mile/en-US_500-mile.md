## Sinopse

Summary from An Endless Story: "If you ride a train you can see there are a lot of different people. I wonder where they came from and where they are going. I've been able to hear many conversations and I wonder what kind of relationship these people have. I want to talk to them and ask, but I would be weird if I did so I just enjoy imagining it by myself."
