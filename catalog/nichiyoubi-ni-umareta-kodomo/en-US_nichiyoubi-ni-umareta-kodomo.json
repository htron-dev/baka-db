    "sinopse": "Roland falls ill for several days, but wakes to a lovely surprise. Not only does he feel better, but he has a handsome new butler waiting on his every need. Roland can't help but fall in love, and the young Eric can't help but give in to his master. As Roland continues to recover, he begins to doubt himself and Eric's affection. Is it genuine, or just part of his job? And when Roland's wayward wife returns to the estate, will Eric have learn his place as a servant? Or if it is love…can it conquer class, age, and even another marriage?\n\n(Source: DMG)",
