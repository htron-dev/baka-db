However, his lover, a former Host named Shinobu Hishiya, has forsaken the wild club lifestyle in favor of his new job as a construction worker. Together, they share wild days and passionate nights, making love whenever, wherever, and however they want. But when jealousy and male pride rear their ugly heads, their blissful, sexy relationship may not be able to handle the strain.\n\n(Source: Be Beautiful)",
