Good luck ^^」\n\nHe turned his back to his childhood friend who looked at him with eyes of resentment. And when he was on his way home… he was chased by goblins.\n\n「Noooooooo!! Someone help meeeeeeeeeee!!」\n\nThis is a misunderstood hero of legend and a saint with the worst personalities, pulling each other's leg while pursuing a happy life.\n\n(Source: MU, edited)",
