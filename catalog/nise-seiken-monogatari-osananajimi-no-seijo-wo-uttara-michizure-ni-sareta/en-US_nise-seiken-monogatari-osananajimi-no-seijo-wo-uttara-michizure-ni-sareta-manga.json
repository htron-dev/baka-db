    "sinopse": "While feeling a little loneliness… he held down his childhood friend who was trying to escape no matter what and turned her over to the knight who came to pick her up.\n\n「Alistaaaaaaaaaaaaar!!」\n\nHe heard a resentful voice, but assumed it was his imagination.\n\nHe was taken along to the capital to see her off as a last struggle… but, it ended without any problems.\n\n「Now, I’m going home. Good luck ^^」\n\nHe turned his back to his childhood friend who looked at him with eyes of resentment. And when he was on his way home… he was chased by goblins.\n\n「Noooooooo!! Someone help meeeeeeeeeee!!」\n\nThis is a misunderstood hero of legend and a saint with the worst personalities, pulling each other's leg while pursuing a happy life.\n\n(Source: MU, edited)",
