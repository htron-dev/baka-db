## Sinopse

A Jack of All Trades is a person who can competently do all kinds of jobs. Loser Zhang Dabao is a professional Jack of All Trades, but his living conditions are, shall we say, less than satisfactory. One day, a beautiful woman who is being harassed by a pervert approaches him for help. He accepts, and soon embarks on a mission like nothing the world has seen before.
