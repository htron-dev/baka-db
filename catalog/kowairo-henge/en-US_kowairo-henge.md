## Sinopse

Torigoe has a unique job. He uses his talent of people's voices to help encourage and inspire others by using voices of loved ones from their life, even if that person has been dead for a long time. One day, after finishing one of his jobs, he meets an injured girl in a tree named Uguisu, and it turns out she is his next client. What's so special about Uguisu that makes Torigoe treat her differently from all his other clients?
