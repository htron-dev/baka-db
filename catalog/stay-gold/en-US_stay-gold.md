## Sinopse

Three years after their mother's abandonment, Hayato and younger sister Kikka are living a relatively normal life with their step uncles, Yuuji and Kou. All seems well, except Hayato harbors romantic feelings for Yuuji. No longer able to bear the burden of his secret love, Hayato confesses to Yuuji, and throws their seemingly normal life into chaos.
