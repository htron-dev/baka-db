## Sinopse

Sold by his parents to a brothel, Yuki is placed under the care of the mysterious Shirogane. Shirogane, who is known for his skill at training young boys to satisfy customers with their bodies, pleasures Yuki every night and introduces him to the debaucherous world of carnal pleasure. But on the night Shirogane declares Yuki ready to receive customers, Yuki cries "I only want Shirogane... please go all the way...!"
