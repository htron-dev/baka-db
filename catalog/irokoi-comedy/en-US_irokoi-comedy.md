## Sinopse

Ch01-02: Yaasu has psychic powers, and recently it seems, a spirit has possessed his body for the purpose of confessing to Yuuma's childhood friend, Ritsu. Before leaving this world, the spirit would like to spend the night with Ritsu. Will Yuuma agree? If Yuuma crawls into Ritsu's bed, will Ritsu accept him? And when all is said and done, why does this spirit now have legs?

Ch03-04: What's a uke to do when his 79-year old grandpa, who is a mad scientist, creates a pill that can make him look 29? And the reason for looking young again - to go after his grandson's boyfriend. Will Grandpa's groping and kidnapping finally get our couple to heat up the sheets? Or will grandpa get himself a new toy?
