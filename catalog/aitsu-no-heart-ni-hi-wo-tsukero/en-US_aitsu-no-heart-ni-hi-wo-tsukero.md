## Sinopse

Kaduki Haruto runs away from his Old Japanese Court Music family, after he discovering that he likes modern music. His family is opposed to him being involved with anything but traditional music. Amamiya Keigo finds Kaduki singing in front of his apartment building. Kaduki collapses and Amamiya takes him to his appartment and cares for Kaduki, as though Kaduki were a stray cat. Kaduki begs to be allowed to stay and work for Amamiya. Amamiya agrees. What happens next?
