She is Meguri Ichiko, the main character of this series.\n\nWith posh brand named clothes and her attitude, no one would believe at first that she's a detective, an assistant inspector for the Narcotic Department for the Metropolitan Police Department. Aside from her work, Ichiko does take another thing seriously at heart, that's a man with 5E. 5E? What is 5E....?",
