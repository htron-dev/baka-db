## Sinopse

Hitomi Kosaka, who wants to be a novelist, admires Takeru Murasaki, a genius writer and high-school student. She dreams that he would help her make her debut, and enters the same high school that he attends. However, being opposite of the image, Takeru is dirty-minded and sadistic in reality. What is worse, he says to her, "I'll make love to you."
