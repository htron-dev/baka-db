However, just before that, her mind was moved to the world of the online game she was playing. When she awoke, she was in the game, moreover it was 200 years in the future?\n\nWell for the time being, in order to survive, I should probably do something.\n\nIn the world of a video game, who stands in the way of the fumbling girl making her way through?!\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
