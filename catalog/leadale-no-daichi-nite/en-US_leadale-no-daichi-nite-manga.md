## Sinopse

Due to an accident, half of Keina Kagami's body was paralyzed. One day, because of a power outage, she regrettably died. However, just before that, her mind was moved to the world of the online game she was playing. When she awoke, she was in the game, moreover it was 200 years in the future?

Well for the time being, in order to survive, I should probably do something.

In the world of a video game, who stands in the way of the fumbling girl making her way through?!
