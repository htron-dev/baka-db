    "sinopse": "\"Ugh, why do I have to be married to you?\"\n\"That's my line.\"\n\nDue to the Isurugi family's circumstances, Haru has to enter into a political marriage with his former girlfriend and childhood friend, Rio Tamaki. Living together under one roof, a dry life together for the sake of formality... though in actuality, the two have unresolved feelings for each other...\n\n\"O-oh no... if he's this close to me... my feelings for Haru are still...\"\n\"There's no way I can let her find out that she still has a strong influence on me.\"\n\nWhile desperately pretending as if they've gotten over their feelings for each other, their awareness towards the other grows. A fake marriage where a former couple's love is gradually reignited. Watch as the vexing love comedy about the two's fake marriage life is interwoven.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
