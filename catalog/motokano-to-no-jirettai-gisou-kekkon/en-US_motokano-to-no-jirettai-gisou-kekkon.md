## Sinopse

"Ugh, why do I have to be married to you?"
"That's my line."

Due to the Isurugi family's circumstances, Haru has to enter into a political marriage with his former girlfriend and childhood friend, Rio Tamaki. Living together under one roof, a dry life together for the sake of formality... though in actuality, the two have unresolved feelings for each other...

"O-oh no... if he's this close to me... my feelings for Haru are still..."
"There's no way I can let her find out that she still has a strong influence on me."

While desperately pretending as if they've gotten over their feelings for each other, their awareness towards the other grows. A fake marriage where a former couple's love is gradually reignited. Watch as the vexing love comedy about the two's fake marriage life is interwoven.
