    "sinopse": "It's a mysterious and haunting series about a man who is tossed about in time and space, never knowing who he is or why he's fated to be a perpetual voyager. His name is Facade, and he shares his body with four other entities—Wolf Face, a male wolf who has mastered human speech; Twin, a female swan with a double pair of wings; the Professor, who is pure personality without a body of his own; and Naaku, a dragon. Sometimes Facade's co-tenants manifest in their own bodies, sometimes they merely change part of Facade's body into their own. This allows Facade, for instance, to fly with Twin's wings or, to manifest as the god Anubis to a number of ancient Egyptians by grafting Wolf Face's head onto his own human body.",
