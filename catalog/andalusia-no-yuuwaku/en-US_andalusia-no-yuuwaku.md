## Sinopse

Sebastian Garcia is shaken by the overwhelming attraction he feels for Rosie Lambert. Maybe it's because she seems innocent and trustworthy, so unlike the many fortune hunters who've pursued him before?

Soon Sebastian makes Rosie his woman. So how can Rosie tell him the real reason for her sudden appearance in his life, when it could destroy his faith in her? And she may be pregnant with his child....
