## Sinopse

Motoko is a plain looking girl. Compared to her sister who is beautiful, good at sports and excels at studying, she is nothing. Then one day when she was on the bus she saw a radio, but this radio... can vanish by itself? And the sound coming from the radio is something she remembers from long ago...

Ten years ago when Motoko was staying with her grandmother, she met a mysterious boy that she called Pook. When Pook had to leave the town, he told her that surely, if it's what she wants, they would meet again ten years from that very night. Thinking back to her childhood she can remember the promise they made to each other, but how is it significant?

Following the incident with the radio she continues to see strange things at random intervals; a radio with legs that that can run, appear, and vanish quickly, a train in the sky, and a mysterious man that can disappear at will. Nobody else seems to see anything -- she's the only one.

That same night the radio shows up once again in her room, says that same familiar phrase, and then runs off once again. This time Motoko is certain that it's something Pook used to tell her. Right after that, Motoko sees the train again, running across the night sky. Deciding that the radio wants her to follow it's trail, she sneaks out of the house and starts to follow it...
