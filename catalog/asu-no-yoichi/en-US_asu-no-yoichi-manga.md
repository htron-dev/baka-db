## Sinopse

A boy trained by his father in the way of the "Ukiha Kamikaze" swordplay, Yoichi, has lived in the mountains, far from civilzation for all seventeen years of his life. His father finds nothing more to teach him, and sends him to the city to lodge at the Ikaruga dojo to further his mental and physical capabilities. Four sisters live in the dojo and Yoichi begins a new more severe "training" regimen.
