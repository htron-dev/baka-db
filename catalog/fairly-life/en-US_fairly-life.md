## Sinopse

Based on Hooksoft's visual novel.

When Akinori and Minami, his old friend, are on their way to school, an artificial satellite falls down nearby. When they get to the site, a girl comes out of the rubble. Her name is Asagao and she is a personified artificial satellite, according to her. She also says she knows Akinori. Asagao carries on talking about herself and Akinori remembers the fact he wants to forget. Once Akinori accepts Asagao's hope that is to protect Akinori's peace, other stuff also personify themselves one after another.
