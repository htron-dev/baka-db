## Sinopse

Yamato has always drawn his heart's desires down in his sketch book, but when his affluent father tells him that art is worthless it puts an end to Yamato's days of dreaming... until Yamato meets his sister's fiancé, who asks Yamato to draw one Last Portrait.

In an additional story, Narumi Imai graduated from the academy only to become the FBI's errand boy. Now, he must baby-sit Keith Coburn, a man whose life and mission both have a time limit. How far up the Stairway to Heaven will Narumi climb with him? (Source: DramaQueen)
