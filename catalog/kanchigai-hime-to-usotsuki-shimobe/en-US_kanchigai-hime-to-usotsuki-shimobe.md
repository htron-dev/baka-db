## Sinopse

"It's okay to be a servant, I want to be by your side...!"
"You'll treat me really really well?"

Mayuri, a girl who wanted to be acknowledged as herself shares the same room with her senpai, Akira who is the student council president and a beautiful person envied by others. But, Akira has a big secret...? Somehow, her real self is a "boy"!? Moreover, he makes a petition of wanting to be Mayuri's servant...?

Thus, the wonderful room sharing life of the domineering(!) beautiful girl, Mayuri and a boy wearing girl's clothes who's also a bit of a trickster(?) Akira starts.

Takamiya Satoru's lyrical love comedy.
