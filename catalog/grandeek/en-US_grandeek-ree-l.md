## Sinopse

Tiia Oruburaianto is a young woman traveling the world, searching for the best weapons. Tiia is a strong warrior and possesses not only the legendary sword Grandeek, but also the unique ability to see and speak to spirits that reside within weapons and armor. During her travels, Tiia hears a small voice calling for help. Tiia eventually finds the source of the voice—the sword of an infamous assassin. Undaunted, Tiia decides to save both the sword and its owner.
