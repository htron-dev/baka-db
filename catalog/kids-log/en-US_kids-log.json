    "sinopse": "Popular writer Itsusu Touki learns about the death of his estranged twin brother, Kazuki, and rushes to help in any way he can. This eventually ends up in him being given custody of Kazuki's toddler son, Ryouta. Ryouta quickly comes under the impression that Touki's his father, but this is the least of the young man's problems as he struggles to overcome the trials of suddenly finding himself a single parent.\n\n(Source: MU)",
