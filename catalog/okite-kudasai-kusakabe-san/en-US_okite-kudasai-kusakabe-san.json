    "sinopse": "This is a story about a girl who wants nothing more but to sleep in on her holidays, Kusakabe, and her boyfriend who wants nothing more but to get her outside, Saneomi. His attempts to use everything at his disposal to coerce her out of bed are met with her attempts to stop him at all costs. It's a love comedy about the weekends that these two spend together.\n\n(Source: MU)",
