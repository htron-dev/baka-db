    "sinopse": "\"An unknown city in an unknown land. Demons infest the land, madness rules the streets. Money and greed control the people who prey on each other. The young use their flesh, the strong their violence and sly their wits, trying to reign over the city. The weak are raped. Pleasure is only for the strong. That is the law, however cruel. The game has begun. The question is who will bring it to an end.\"\n\n(Source: MU)",
