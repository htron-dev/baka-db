## Sinopse

The events take place during the Great Exhibition of technological breakthroughs in Victorian England, in mid-nineteenth century. Ray is a boy, the son and grandson of two great inventors, and since he was a little boy he dedicated himself to create amazing machines driven by steam power. One day his grandfather Lloyd returns from the United States, where he is working with his son to a secret project called for the multinational Ohara Foundation, and handing the boy a metal ball that can produce an immense energy.

This marks the beginning of the adventures of the boy, who from that moment it will be hunted by the henchmen of the U.S. company and its competitors, eager to retrieve the precious item needed for their major project: the imposing Tower Steam, the ultimate war machine. A clash of generations between father, son and nephew, their world views and values of life, a brilliant critique of modern society and war.
