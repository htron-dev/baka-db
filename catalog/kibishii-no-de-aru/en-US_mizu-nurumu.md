## Sinopse

Yusuke Onishi easily gets crushes on everybody and anybody, but never succeeds in love. That is, until the day he meets and falls in love with his new neighbor—a mature single parent. Yusuke has finally met his match. But his match just happens to be a guy! This is a classic oyaji-uke of an unexpected love between two people, one younger, one older.
