## Sinopse

Everyone thought Naoki was a little flamboyant, and he was used to getting teased for it. But when Yada glanced at him, he felt something he never had before! Ten deftly written short episodes explore the pathos, confusion, drama, passion and humor of coming out and finding one’s true self. Forbidden desire, hidden lust, jealousy and acceptance collide in this collection of wonderfully drawn, bittersweet short stories of teenage romance by author Yugi Yamada!
