## Sinopse

A young man sits in the inner room of a library, diligently restoring old—but valuable—books to their former splendour. An enthusiastic, upbeat young police officer often comes to him for help with hard-to-solve cases...But what exactly is the mysterious skill that allows this man to unfailingly discover the truth lying in places that even the watchful eye of the Law has failed to penetrate?
