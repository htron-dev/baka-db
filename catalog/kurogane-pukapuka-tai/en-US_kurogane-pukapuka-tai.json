    "sinopse": "An epic yuri romance in the carefully reconstructed WW2 setting... not! The story follows the adventures of a Japanese battleship, the crew of which consists solely of girls for some reason. This is pure fan-service and the historical details could perhaps be questioned, but as long as you like ships, tough girls and comedy, you're still gonna enjoy it.\n\n(Source: MU)",
