## Sinopse

The six romantic, sensual shorts in The Gentleman and the Lady reveal that love is often surprising and always unavoidable. There may be more to a friendship than meets the eye, as true love is sometimes hidden where a girl least expects it.

This endearing collection by Kazumi Tohno opens with the title story, introducing the "chummy threesome": Kotoko, Katsuto, and Komon. These close-knit friends get along very well... but even the best of friends are put to the test when they're all stuck in a love triangle with each other!

Read on to find out what happens in The Gentleman and the Lady, and all the rest of these moving tales!
