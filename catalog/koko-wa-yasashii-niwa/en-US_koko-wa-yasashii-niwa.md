## Sinopse

Kaoru is a guy who has hated to work hard in vain ever since childhood because he couldn't get his mother's love no matter how hard he tried. One day, a strange guy appears and identifies himself as his "brother." Because the man's heart is wounded, Kaoru let him stay for the time being, but what will this event develop itself into?
