## Sinopse

The "intense gun action" story is set in the United States in the aftermath of the American Civil War. In the chaotic atmosphere of the postwar period, the northern government issues "Licenses to Kill" to bounty hunters in order for them to take out the South's remaining soldiers and outlaws. One of those bounty hunters, a female gunslinger known as "Black Tiger," faces off against dark enemies who carry fiendish weapons.
