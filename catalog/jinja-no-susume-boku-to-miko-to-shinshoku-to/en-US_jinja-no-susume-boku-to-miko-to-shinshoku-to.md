## Sinopse

After his older brother's disappearance, Satomi Shinjirou must take up the mantle of heir to his family's Shinto Shrine. But learning to become a Priest might be much more than he bargained for, especially with the feelings he seems to be unwillingly developing for a certain young Miko...

Jinja no Susume is a unique slice of life story with a touch of romance and comedy that also gives the reader a view of the inner workings of a modern day Shinto Shrine.
