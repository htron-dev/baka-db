## Sinopse

The story is set in Japan in the middle ages. Tsujimura Genzo is a puppeteer whose heart has become as hard as stone due to the murder of his beloved wife. In each story, Genzo brings the dead back alive as puppets, and by doing so, he is able to solve mysterious incidents or help a dead man's soul. Kikuhime, a young "tomboy" princess is Genzo's companion and helps him fight the villains.
