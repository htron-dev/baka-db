    "sinopse": "There's a great war between Rohaman and Tiroko. The queen of Rohaman unseals an ancient weapon with which they have a chance of winning the war. However, the weapon is incomplete and so they can only use a part of its powers.\n\nOne day, while being attacked, a young knight saves the queen from a powerful enemy. Seeing his skill and powers to be far greater than the average knight, she sends the soldier off with two companions in search for the missing pieces of power needed to make the ancient weapon whole.\n\n(Source: M-U)",
