    "sinopse": "Yutaka \"Yuta\" Yasuda inadvertently walks through a portal and is transported into another world, one of which he has no knowledge of how to communicate or survive in. Five years later, he is a 32-year-old man who earns a living cooking okonomiyaki, a savory Japanese pancake, for the locals of a village. However, his life is not completely worry-free; due to his black hair and eyes, he is considered a rarity among the people of the world, leading countless men and women to forcibly court him via dueling, a custom of the land.\n\nDuring one of his many fights, Yuta is asked by Mel—a regular at the shop and a wandering swordsman—if he can fight in the cook's stead. Yuta initially agrees, but unbeknownst to him, he is required to marry the man who takes his place if the duel is won. Sure enough, Mel wins and Yuta reluctantly becomes his consort, but how will he fare in a sudden engagement to the man who longs for his heart?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
