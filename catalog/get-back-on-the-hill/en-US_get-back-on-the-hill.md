## Sinopse

This film was made based on Tanaamiâ€™s fear of heights and his experience of seeing New York from the rooftop of a 50-floor apartment. Even the quotidian activity of walking across a zebra crossing becomes an abstract image observed from these heights. Using the process of color separation, the colors shift across each frame and create a surreal universe.
