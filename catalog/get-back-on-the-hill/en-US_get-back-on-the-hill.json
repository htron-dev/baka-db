    "sinopse": "This film was made based on Tanaamiâ€™s fear of heights and his experience of seeing New York from the rooftop of a 50-floor apartment. Even the quotidian activity of walking across a zebra crossing becomes an abstract image observed from these heights. Using the process of color separation, the colors shift across each frame and create a surreal universe.\n\n(Source: Collaborative Cataloging Japan)",
