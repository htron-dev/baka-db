## Sinopse

More than twenty years ago, an evil summoner committed "Great Summon." One third of human beings were killed, and devils and monsters invaded the earth. One day, a painter Tamura Fukutaro moves in an apartment house called "Ashiaraiyashiki" and gets involved in the troubles of his non-human neighbors. It's the beginning of a severe battle among gods, devils and the ruler "The Central."
