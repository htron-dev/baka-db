## Sinopse

Although the family vacation was cancelled, our heroine decides to go forward alone. However the onsen inn turns out to be an extremely weird place! Not only is the staff all male and the gorgeous managers (a pair of brothers) are constantly fighting over the right to inherit the inn, even monkeys visit the springs as though they own it! How will our heroine ever get out of this mess?
