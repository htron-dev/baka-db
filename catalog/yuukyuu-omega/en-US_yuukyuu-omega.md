## Sinopse

Akitsugu Suzuya is a lazy omega who hates working, and for the past two years has lied about the effectiveness of his heat suppressants to scam his company into giving him three days of paid time off each month. But when alpha Shouta Furuike, a new hire at his job, comes knocking on his door offering to "help" him during his heat, Suzuya desperately scrambles to keep his lie from being exposed.
