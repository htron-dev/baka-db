## Sinopse

Three thousand years ago, a sect of ancient Indian priests who sought world peace and justice, developed an unimaginable fist and sent their disciples throughout the world. Their mission, passed on to their descendants, was to live in the shadows of history and judge the evils of this world where the law cannot judge! They are the Family of Brahman!
