## Sinopse

High school student Ginji Kusanagi is about to make his dreams come true. He's made his professional boxing debut and is ready to go on the first date with the girl of his dreams, Minako. However, the unthinkable has happened. Ginji is in an accident, and his spirit is seperated from his body, effectively killing him before his time. A (sort of) angel tells him that he can be reincarnated as an animal and return to his body after he's lived out its lifespan. He chooses to be reincarnated as a penguin, Minako's favorite animal. Now Ginji lives with Minako as Gin the penguin and just tries to make it along as a penguin while waiting to be returned to his body.
