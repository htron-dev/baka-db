As multiple dark rumors spread across the school regarding the mysterious new transfer student, Watazumi Makia, strange events repeat themselves inside Sena Koji's dreams and his reality. He can't tell whether these events are actually happening, or if they are only just a bad dream. One thing is obvious: Watazumi Makia has something to do with the sudden deaths of his classmates.
