The affectionate top student Hamada, and the simple, but cool Osamu are both deeply attracted to each other. Hamada, being the affectionate one, is easily attracted to other people, regardless of their sex. However, in the end, he will always return to Osamu's side. Sometimes, Hamada feels like he is being manipulated, but he also feels that Osamu loves him. This is their ironic love story.
