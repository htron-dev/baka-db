    "sinopse": "One day, police sergeant Satsuki Rena is sent to pick up her new superior, the \"Destroyer\" Sakurama Shinobu, from the airport. He earned his nickname due to his apparent habit of causing the ruin of his superiors. Rena is surprised to find that he is a friendly and ordinary-seeming man. However, the morning he arrives, his superior in his new office is shot to death in a crime that mimics a murder attempt from 19 years ago.\n\nIt doesn't seem like it could have possibly been Sakurama's fault, but it doesn't help his reputation. When Sakurama is warned off pursuing the case by the chief inspector, the advice kicks his interest into high gear. As he pursues the case, not even the police are above suspicion. What will he uncover?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
