    "sinopse": "For the 73rd class of cadets of the Defense University of the small planet Kibi, a shakedown cruise on the fleet's new starship \"Amaterasu\" is a fitting lead-up to graduation. As they are returning to their home planet, however, they are shocked to hear news of a declaration of war by the aggressive Kingdom against Kibi. When their planetary government surrenders without a struggle, the cadets decide to launch their own war, aboard the \"Amaterasu.\" To gain funding, they make a deal with a galactic news network - and find themselves the \"stars\" of their own \"reality show.\" Unfortunately, this is the kind of reality show that can get you killed...\n\n(Source: MU)",
