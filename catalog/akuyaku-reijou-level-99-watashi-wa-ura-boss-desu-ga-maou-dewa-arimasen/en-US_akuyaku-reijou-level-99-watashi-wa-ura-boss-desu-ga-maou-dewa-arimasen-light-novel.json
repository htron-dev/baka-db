    "sinopse": "I was reborn as the villainous daughter, Yumiela Dolknes, in the world of an otome RPG game. Yumiela only had a small role in the original story, but after defeating the Demon King, she will appear as the Hidden Boss with a bonus specs to solo fight the Hero party. Having a gamer-spirit, I've been raising my level since I was a child. By the time I enter the academy where the game stage is, I was level 99. I wanted the heroine and the capture targets to defeat the Demon King, but they just flirted around and didn't raise their level. Moreover, they treat me as if I'm the Demon King just because I have dark hair and use dark magic.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
