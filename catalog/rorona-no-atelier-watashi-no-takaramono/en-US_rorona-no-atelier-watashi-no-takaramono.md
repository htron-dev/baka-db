## Sinopse

Based on the PS3 RPG, this tells the story of the young, somewhat lazy alchemist Rorona. Rorona lives in the small kingdom of Arland, with her teacher Astrid and a helper called Hom. Unfortunately for Rorona, Alchemy is not as popular as it once was, and the government has given her atelier a three year review period to prove that it should not be shut down. Rorona lives peacefully amidst her numerous friends while she tries her best to prove the usefulness of alchemy. She works to complete the tasks assigned to her by the government, in addition to helping out various townspeople. Though she messes up sometimes, and occasionally slacks off, she’ll try her best to protect her atelier!
