There, to her dismay, she finds that she's allergic to the cats that she adores, so another woman at the pet store offers herself as a \"pet.\" Delirious from the fatigue, Chihiro accepts and they head together to her apartment. After collapsing in her bed, Chihiro wakes up to a clean apartment and a warm meal from Nagisa Wataya, the beautiful and peppy woman she took as a \"pet\"... However, Nagisa has some... interesting quirks...\n\n(Source: MangaDex)",
