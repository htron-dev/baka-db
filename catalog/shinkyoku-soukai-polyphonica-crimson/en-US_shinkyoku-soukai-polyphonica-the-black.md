## Sinopse

Polyphonica "the Black" is finally made available as a "hard-boiled" detective comic. In this city the police have joined forces with spirits to investigate crimes, resulting in the formation of a specialist unit—the "Spirits of the Dead" or "Ghost" Division.

A murder occured in a quiet residential area, and the victim's daughter vanished from the scene leaving only mystery in her wake.
The victim's contracted spirit was "Leon"... but is he really a criminal?
