    "sinopse": "If there is one thing that Tanaka wants more than anything, it is a quiet, uneventful day. With the help of his caring and reliable best friend Oota, as well as various other classmates, Tanaka strives to spend his high school days in the most peaceful way possible. Whether it be sleeping in the perfect spot at school or idly staring out of a window, his friends can count on finding him trying to live life as listlessly as possible. With the constant threat of everyday annoyances surrounding him, Tanaka uses every chance he has to avoid high-energy situations and just lie down for a good nap.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
