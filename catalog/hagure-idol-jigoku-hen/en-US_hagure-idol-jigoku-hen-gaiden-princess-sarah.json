    "sinopse": "A one-volume spinoff of Hagure Idol Jigokuhen, this calvacade of short stories focuses on \"Princess\" Sarah Goujima - a friend to main protagonist Misora Haebaru, and a full-time porn actress. You name it, she's done it - she's covered every fetish both legal and illegal, and the people she's made love to could easily fill a football stadium to the brim. She's lewd, crude, and will bang any dude.\n\n(Source: MU)",
