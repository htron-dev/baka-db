## Sinopse

It is the early 1980s where there is no internet or cell phones. Jou Umeyoshi, who gets carried away easily, meets Chihiro Sakagami and falls in love with him at first sight. Umeyoshi is excited and thinks that Chihiro is his destiny. On the other hand, Chihiro, whose father is a famous actor, couldn't find his place in life. But seeing the unique and straightforward Jou makes him feel things he's never felt before?!
