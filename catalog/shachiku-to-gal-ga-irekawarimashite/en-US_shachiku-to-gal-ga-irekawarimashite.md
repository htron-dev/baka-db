## Sinopse

No hobbies, no holidays, no girlfriend, Enomoto lives just to work. Although she enjoys high school life, Riko finds it a little boring. It just so happens that these two swap bodies?! Thrown into their opposite lives, what a crisis! However, talking to women in the baths, and using gal power to fight off exploitative bosses... It's surprisingly cool!?
