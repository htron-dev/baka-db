    "sinopse": "Despite the title this manga has nothing to do with sex, just young people rebelling against the world.\n\nThe manga is about the adventures of a girl, Kaho. In the first chapter she goes on holiday to Okinawa and falls in love with Yuki, a car-stealing punk.\n\nOften considered Kamijo's best work.",
