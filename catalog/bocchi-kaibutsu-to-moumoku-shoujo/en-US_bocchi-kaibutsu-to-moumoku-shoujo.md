## Sinopse

In the middle of a secluded forest lives a lonely monster. Isolating herself from humanity due to her appearance, she lives each day yearning for company. One day, her wish comes true when she meets a blind stranger walking around the woods near the empty house she occupies. Unable to see the monster's appearance, the girl—Lily Blind—treats her with a kindness that she has never known.

Desiring to form a connection, the monster—nicknamed "Heath" by Lily—decides to lie about her identity. After a series of misunderstandings, Heath finds herself struggling with the guilt of her actions. When Heath suspects that Lily is moving away, she resolves to confess her love before it is too late.

Bocchi Kaibutsu to Moumoku Shoujo explores the rapidly deepening love between two girls that have never quite been understood.
