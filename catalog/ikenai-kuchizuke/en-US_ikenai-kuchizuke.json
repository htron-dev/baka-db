    "sinopse": "Ever since her great-grandmother first told her about her life in Italy, Gabriella has wanted to visit there. So she enters a study abroad program, and becomes best friends with a local named Giovanni. Giovanni isn't just an ordinary Italian—he's the heir of the prestigious Provere family. His brother, Luca, is studying to become another in a long line of family priests. Luca and Gabriella are instantly drawn to each other, but a relationship is impossible given Luca's future—and the single kiss they share torments them both.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
