## Sinopse

In the depths of a vast western desert exists a terrible sand devil. He is bent on turning the forests, rivers, grasslands, and oases of the Western Regions into barren deserts under his rule. In order to save the inhabitants and prevent desertification, a group of young adventurers sets out to the Kunlun Mountains to find the legendary Hu Poplar King and curb the spread of sand.
