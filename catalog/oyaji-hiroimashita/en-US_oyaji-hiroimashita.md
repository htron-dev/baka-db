## Sinopse

1-3. Oyaji Hiroimashita (I Picked Up an Old Man)
Tired after working all day long, the divorced (with kids?!) salary man, Saeki Ryouji was taken in by the incredibly rich high school student, Mibu Ryuunosuke, after having collapsed in the middle of the street. When he awoke, he was kissed by Mibu who said, “I like you,” at which point he realized he had been brought to a glamorous and luxurious mansion…!!! Despite this astoundingly shocking development, the guilt he felt the second he rejected Mibu, who was on the verge of tears, brought Ryouji to...? Differences in age, differences in social standing, they are nothing but a bother. Are there simply too many obstacles to the love that has blossomed between a sheltered young Master and a pure and cultured oyaji?
