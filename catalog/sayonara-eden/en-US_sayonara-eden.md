## Sinopse

Goodbye Eden is a story of youth set in a post-apocalyptic Japan. While downing the "medicine," the government provided them with the purpose of dimming their fear, middle school students are armed with weapons to fight back against the "enemies," that assail them. Among them is a girl named Chikori, a normal girl who wishes to fall in love. However, with the world as it is, normality is difficult to uphold.
