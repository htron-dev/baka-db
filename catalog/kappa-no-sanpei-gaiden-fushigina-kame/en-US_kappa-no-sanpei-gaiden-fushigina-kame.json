    "sinopse": "Set a short while before the end of the original rental book version of the story, this charming tale tells of a mysterious string of disappearances throughout the village.\n\nMany of the school children appear to go missing without explanation and it's not until Kanpei stumbles across an eerie earthenware pot lying in the grass on his way home that he discovers the true whereabouts of his fellow villagers.\n\nThis extremely rare manga is one of 4 chapters that are long out of print and incredibly difficult to get hold of. The other 3 chapters (or gaiden) are: 木神さま(Kikami-sama), 幽霊の手(Yuurei no te), and 夢のハム工場 (Yume no Ham Koujou).",
