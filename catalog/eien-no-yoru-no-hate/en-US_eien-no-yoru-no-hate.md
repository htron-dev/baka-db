## Sinopse

A single parent and salaryman, Atsushi, meets his neighbor, Hiiro, through strange circumstances. He is concerned about the beautiful, but also somewhat lonely Hiiro, yet he was told "You've heard of vampires, right? Don't get close to me..." Even so, Atsushi can't leave him alone and makes a proposition...?!
