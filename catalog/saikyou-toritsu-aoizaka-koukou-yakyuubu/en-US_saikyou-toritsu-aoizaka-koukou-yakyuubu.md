## Sinopse

Six years ago, following a crushing defeat, a group of friends promised that they will one day take their friend Suzuo to the Koshien. Now in their first year of high school, the friends have reunited behind the pitcher Kitaro Kitaoji to keep their promise. With Suzuo as their manager and Kitaro's signature left-handed, underhand "Submarine Pitch," they may just go all the way.
