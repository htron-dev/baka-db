    "sinopse": "However cliche his motives were, Aki became a chef to see people's faces light up when they eat good food. So, when Eiji, the high schooler who would watch him grill meat through the window every day shows up yet again one rainy day, Aki can't help but beckon him in. Soon, Eiji is chowing down the meat, and while this satisfies Aki's desire to feed him... it lights a fire under his desire to be eaten, too...\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
