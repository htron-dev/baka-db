    "sinopse": "\"I can help you laugh, but I can't take away the tears you've shed.\" In Mametsubu-cho, a town somewhere in the ancient Japanese city of Kamakura, Ochibi-san lives a relaxed, easy life. With his friend Nazeni the dog, Jack the naughty kitten, and Pankui the hungry dog, Ochibi-san's year in Mametsubu-cho is filled with encounters and new discoveries! Flower-viewing in spring, swimming in summer, collecting leaves in fall, and eating yummy food in winter.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
