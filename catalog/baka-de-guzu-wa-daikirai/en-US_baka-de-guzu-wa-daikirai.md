## Sinopse

Haru has been in love with Soudai, his elder brother's best friend, since he was a child. More than his brother, Haru chases after Soudai and even gets into the same club as him. He can't be with him all the time, and if Soudai doesn't look at him, he will feel worried but he can't be honest at all.

Eventually, when Soudai becomes a university student, he leaves his hometown and he hasn't contacted Haru once after that. He wants to forget Soudai but he can't... Even though this love is painful but he can't stop it―?
