He can't be with him all the time, and if Soudai doesn't look at him, he will feel worried but he can't be honest at all.\n\nEventually, when Soudai becomes a university student, he leaves his hometown and he hasn't contacted Haru once after that. He wants to forget Soudai but he can't... Even though this love is painful but he can't stop it―?\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Kou Miete Junai",
