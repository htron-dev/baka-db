## Sinopse

Only with a slight touch, Tsubasa could hear the voice's inside someone's heart. That was the reason that makes her feel scared to get close to anyone. She's willing to be alone rather than getting forced to know their secrets. Even so, Tsubasa's special abilities had helped her revealing bully cases at her school.
