## Sinopse

In their single-father household, Takeyoshi, a high school student, and his father split all the household chores. Lately, his father has been praising his subordinate, "Nishida-kun." While Takeyoshi is slightly perturbed that his father praises Nishida-kun as "more beautiful than a woman," the Nishida-kun who comes over is a logical man who says what he wants to say, contrary to his appearance. Unfazed by Nishida-kun's words, Takeyoshi begins to grow interested in him, and invites him over the next day: "Eat dinner with us."
