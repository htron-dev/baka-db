    "sinopse": "In their single-father household, Takeyoshi, a high school student, and his father split all the household chores. Lately, his father has been praising his subordinate, \"Nishida-kun.\" While Takeyoshi is slightly perturbed that his father praises Nishida-kun as \"more beautiful than a woman,\" the Nishida-kun who comes over is a logical man who says what he wants to say, contrary to his appearance. Unfazed by Nishida-kun's words, Takeyoshi begins to grow interested in him, and invites him over the next day: \"Eat dinner with us.\"\n\n(Source: Shodensha, translated)",
