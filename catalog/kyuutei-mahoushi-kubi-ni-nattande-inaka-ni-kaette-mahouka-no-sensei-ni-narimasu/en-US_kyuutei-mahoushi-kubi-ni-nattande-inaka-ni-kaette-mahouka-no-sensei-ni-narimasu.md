## Sinopse

Jade, an elite court magician, gets fired one day due to the plot of a noble. He was expelled from the royal capital and on the way to the countryside where he was born, he was invited by Mina, a childhood friend who he happened to meet again, to become a magic teacher at her school. It was Jade who immediately took charge of the class as a teacher of the magic department, but that class was known as "the fallen magic class."
