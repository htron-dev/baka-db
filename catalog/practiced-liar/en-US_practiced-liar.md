## Sinopse

"This world is full of noise."

Due to his innate ability to "read minds," Miura is completely distrustful of people because he is constantly exposed to their true feelings. One day, he meets Abe, his junior at a university club, who is twice as quiet and expressionless as anyone else. But it turns out, Abe is a person who will talk non-stop like a machine-gun about his pure love for Miura (\*only in his mind)!
