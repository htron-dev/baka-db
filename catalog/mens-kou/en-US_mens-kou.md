## Sinopse

Seiho High School is a private male high school dormitory known as the Japan's Alcatraz Jail among students. Located in a remote place, it is surrounded by sea and mountains and is a 5 minute walk from the ferry and a 50 minute car ride from the closest train station. Men's Kou is about the hilarious antics of high school boys and their lives locked in with fellow classmates, with their hopes of being with women that aren't from magazines!
