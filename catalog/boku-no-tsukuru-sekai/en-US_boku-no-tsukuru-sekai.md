## Sinopse

This isn't an ordinary high school—these kids have magical powers! Having the ability to cast a four-dimensional image can bring you fame and fortune, but you've got to be good at it. And that's what goes on every day in this school for "Projectionists." Some, of course, have an easier time at it than others. And sometimes having magical powers just gets in the way of the usual concerns that complicate a teenager's life. This complete in one-volume collection features stories that focus on different members of the student body. Step into this multi-dimensional world with these magical kids and see how each student deals with his or her special gifts!
