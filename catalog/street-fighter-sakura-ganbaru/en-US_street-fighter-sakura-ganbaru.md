## Sinopse

Unlike most high school girls her age, Sakura Kasugano wants to be a street fighter just like her idol, combat master Ryuu. While trying her best to keep it a secret from her parents, she trains with a boastful but feeble martial artist named Dan Hibiki. Despite being taught his subpar techniques, Sakura not only masters them but also adds her own unique twist.

After winning a handful of fights, Karin Kanzuki—Sakura's classmate and heiress to the Kanzuki Zaibatsu—challenges Sakura to a brawl. Having found a rival, Sakura improves her skills at a rapid rate, and she begins to think about traveling the world to meet Ryuu.
