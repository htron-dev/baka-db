    "sinopse": "Cherry and Virgin is a romantic comedy featuring a 32-year-old \"eromanga\" author Ryou and a 28-year-old \"fujoshi'' Ami. Neither character is great at interacting with members of the opposite gender—Ryou is somewhat of an otaku and defenseless against women, and Ami does not have a good impression of 3D men. After a fateful encounter, the story follows the two as they learn to navigate a sea of interpersonal relationships and come to better understand the bitter and sweet aspects of modern relationships.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
