## Sinopse

Cherry and Virgin is a romantic comedy featuring a 32-year-old "eromanga" author Ryou and a 28-year-old "fujoshi'' Ami. Neither character is great at interacting with members of the opposite genderâ€”Ryou is somewhat of an otaku and defenseless against women, and Ami does not have a good impression of 3D men. After a fateful encounter, the story follows the two as they learn to navigate a sea of interpersonal relationships and come to better understand the bitter and sweet aspects of modern relationships.
