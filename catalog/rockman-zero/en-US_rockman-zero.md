## Sinopse

Meet a poor, cowardly reploid named Zero, who's lost his memories! With the help of Lito-chan, Zero's new friend and sidekick, Zero goes on a journey to find them and recover his past.

Of course, he needs to fight his new enemies some of the time—but you have to get him to stop hiding behind Lito-chan first.
