## Sinopse

After spending two years in jail, Ishii Kazuyoshi is finally free—only to get hit by a truck straight away and die. A talking cat offers him a second chance at life, and he then wakes up in the body of a high school girl who had been in a coma for the past three days.

As he was the former director of a karate tournament, the cat tasked him with helping his new body's original owner restore her run-down karate doujou.
