Amasaki Asuka has finally gotten into the school she wants, a school where Togo Hiroshi, the man who rescued her from a subway groper, works as a teacher. She has a big, intensely sexual crush on him, but he seems to not remember her. When Asuka arrives at the school dorm, the dorm leader, Shiga Kahori, shows her around. Asuka is shocked to realize that she has the same sexual feelings for Kahori! Will Kahori return her feelings?
