## Sinopse

ut himself. The cunning gray wolf invented all kinds of magic weapons to catch the lamb. No matter what the environment, the lambs may encounter the trap carefully set by Big Big Wolf. Fortunately, all the lambs are naturally optimistic. Even in the face of danger, they all regard it as adding joy to life and making a period of happy experience. Although the intrusion of Big Big Wolf keeps the lamb's life often on alert, there must be gains if there is a loss. The more violent the Big Big Wolf attack, the more united the lambs. The lambs unite to learn together and work together to find a way to deal with Big Big Wolf. Although Big Big Wolf’s methods of catching sheep change with each passing day, the lambs have the greatest power to deal with Big Big Wolf, which is the sincere and touching friendship between the little sheep. When in danger, never leave any companions behind, and rescue your friends even if you break into the wolf’s mouth.(translated from tenceng)
