## Sinopse

Himari looks like an elementary school student. How did she find suddenly a husband!? Plus, he’s the prince of the school, the famous Kaname-sempai. After the consent of their parents, they start living together… But how a wife is supposed to be? How will be their life as new couple? Hiwari doesn't know anything about it! Also, that guy is maybe popular because of his face, but he is a real devil! But it seems like little by little their new life begins to be more comfortable...
