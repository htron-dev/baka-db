## Sinopse

The series is about the titular character, an intelligent and mischievous pig named G.G. Bond (猪猪侠, meaning "Pig Hero") born with superpowers. He is an orphan under the care and custody of Dr. Mihu, his teacher who enjoys inventing different gadgets.

This is considered "season 0" due to its short length. Originally it was advertised as a for-TV movie.
