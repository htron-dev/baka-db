## Sinopse

Attempting to make GG Bond the partner for Iron Fist, Mr. Mihoo disguised himself as a school teacher, showing GG Bond the charm of interstellar shuttling. GG Bond took his invitation and became an agent. As GG Bond’s pet and mission partner, Iron Fist had the power to absorb everything. His biggest secret was that his stomach linked to the infinite fifth dimension. One day Iron Fist ate the stone of eternal energy. The universe would lose balance without the stone. GG Bond had to enter into Iron Fist’s fifth dimension searching for it. After all adventures and difficulties, he finally brought it out and saved the world.
