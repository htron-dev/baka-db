He spends his days in the empty stairway to the roof of his school and calls it his \"castle.\" One day while he is hanging out in his castle, Baku hears someone refer to his female classmate Kirin with the formal and rather antiquated term \"dono.\" That someone happens to be a talking insect.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
