## Sinopse

The title character is Arisu Tanigawa, an aircraft pilot who gained extraordinary flying skills under the expert tutelage of her father when she was young — but who also has some issues. Arisu's life changes when she has a chance encounter with a mysterious boy on the same airplane she is piloting.
