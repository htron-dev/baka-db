    "sinopse": "Past trauma leads Kai Shiraseki to abandon the world of social game development, so he transfers to Maikun High School to start a new life. But on his first day he meets Nanaka Aoi, the president of a low-tier social game club, and finds out that the club is on the brink of disbanding—and is also populated by total weirdos! The programmer, Aya Oushima, is a crazed gacha addict, and the illustrator, Eru Kuroba, faints from the cuteness of her own drawings?!\n\nKai joins the club, which gives them enough members to continue... or so they thought. The student council hands down an ultimatum: \"Win a competition against another school or disband!\" Now their management talents will really be put to the test. With the skills that he's nurtured and his new set of friends, can Kai face his fears to create the ultimate social game?!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club, edited)",
