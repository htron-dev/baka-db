    "sinopse": "This is a diary-style 4-koma manga that depicts the daily life and observations of the 40-year old author, who married a 26-year old Chinese girl. The author immediately states that this manga-style blog was meant to show the quirky and interesting nature of his young wife. He is an extremely stereotypical \"otaku\", while she is a Chinese girl enjoying and learning the Japanese culture.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
