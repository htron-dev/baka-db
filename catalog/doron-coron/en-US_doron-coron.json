    "sinopse": "An amusing 3-minute clay animation that Yuuichi Itou (Harbor Tale, Knyacki!) produced for \"The Earth and Children of Tomorrow - Pray for Happiness\" campaign by TVK (Television Kanagawa).\n\nDoron Coron comes to life after a child angel tinkles off a cloud. This unusual heavenly elixir rains down onto a dark city street and brings to life the titular boy character made of dirt who rolls off to explore the city. He has a pleasant interaction with a worm, and a not so pleasant interaction with bird excrement, but is cheered by the growth of a plant on his head. The plant grows and grows and Doron Coron heads to the countryside where he enjoys pleasant interactions with the natural world.\n\n(Source: Nishikata Film Review)",
