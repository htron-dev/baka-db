## Sinopse

One day Toto finds a naked, pretty girl (perfect breasts included), but completely without emotions. She came to call Toto "master" and Toto named her "Kuu."

Kuu has a golem, which protects her from Toto's... advances. It also appears that Kuu has enemies who are after her for some reason.

Will Toto and Kuu make it? Romantic love comedy with slight mystery (perfect breasts included).
