With his parents going on a business trip, Shuuto Sakaguchi prepares himself to live in complete freedom for the following three months. However, upon returning home from school, he is greeted by a young girl he has never met before. As it turns out, she is Chiho Norita, the daughter of Shuuto's parents' colleague.
