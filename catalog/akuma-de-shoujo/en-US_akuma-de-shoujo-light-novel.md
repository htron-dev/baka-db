## Sinopse

Kisaragi Yurie finds a stuffed teddy bear, but it's no ordinary teddy bear, it's an Akuma called Devil Bear. Yurie has health problems involving her heart and her childhood friend, Takizawa Ryou, an unrequited love has been acting aloof and distant towards her. Devil Bear grants Yurie three wishes:

1. A healthy body.
2. To have a good relationship with her childhood friend, Takizawa Ryou, who lives next door.
3. Her nakedness to be seen by Ryou and Ryou to be able to touch her body a lot.

What happens next is kind of obvious if anyone is familiar with these bad wish stories.
