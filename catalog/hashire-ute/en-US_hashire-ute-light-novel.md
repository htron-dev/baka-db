## Sinopse

Takagami Riu graduated from middle school. All of his dreams as a normal student had vanished - he was assigned to become a student soldier "Gakuhei" and filled his life with trainings. After the hard training session, Riu was called by instructor and appointed as a "BodyGuard," demanded from a magician officer. "Why it has to be me?" Riu asked this question to himself, and what awaits for him was a cute girl that dressed weird.
