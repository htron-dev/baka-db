## Sinopse

In an English industrial city of the XIX century, the exploitation of workers by employers reaches unbearable levels. In order to change this reality, a group of workers comes together to build their own Utopia. Inspired by the ideas of Marx and Engels in Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848), this manga presents one of the most influential political treaties of all time, which marked the history of the XIX and XX centuries and shaped the world of today.
