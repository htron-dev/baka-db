## Sinopse

Paradise Gakuen's annual competition Miss Paradise is coming soon! But a major incident occurred: one of the girls who hoped to be a contestant, Chihiro, had her precious part seen by a boy! Chihiro, who holds a principle that she won't let anyone other than her husband to see her naked, wants to become Shiba's wife. Because the latter didn't believe her intention, she decides to prove it, by entering the annual competition!
