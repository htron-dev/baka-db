    "sinopse": "There once lived a vampire known as Vanitas, hated by his own kind for being born under a full blue moon, as most arise on the night of a crimson one. Afraid and alone, he created the \"Book of Vanitas,\" a cursed grimoire that would one day take his vengeance on all vampires; this is how the story goes, at least.\n\nVanitas no Karte follows Noé Archiviste, a young man who is traveling aboard an airship in 19th century Paris with one goal in mind: to find the Book of Vanitas. A sudden vampire attack leads him to meet the enigmatic Vanitas, a doctor who specializes in vampires and, much to Noé's surprise, an entirely ordinary human.

But behind his kind demeanor lies something a bit more sinister...\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
