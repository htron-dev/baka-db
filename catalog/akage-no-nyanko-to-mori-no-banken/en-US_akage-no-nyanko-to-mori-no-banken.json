    "sinopse": "In this town, animals live like people. Misha, a cat, finds a fixer-upper deep in the forest and decides to repair it and make it her home, but she isn't making much progress. After a run-in with a hulking, muscular dog (?) named Hati, Misha makes a deal with him: assist her with repairs, and he can live there as well. Misha finds living with the strong, silent Hati to be a breeze, and the two set to work on the house. However, something starts to seem off about Hati. When Misha presses him for answers, she discovers that the full moon has worked Hati's instincts into a frenzy... and his hungry eyes are set on her!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
