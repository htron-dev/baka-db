## Sinopse

Kaoru thought that high school was boring. And then he met Kaname and Yuta. Kaname and Yuta are trying to start "The Creator's Club", a club with creation of all sorts of unusual inventions as its aim. The club's formation is opposed by Kaoru's reticence to make up numbers, and the school council president's obstinate nature. With the aid of hard work, cheeriness and sheep, Kaname, Yuta and a somewhat bemused Kaoru set about changing her mind. (Source: M-U)
