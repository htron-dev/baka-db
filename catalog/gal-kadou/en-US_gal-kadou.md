## Sinopse

Fifteen-year-old Kuzuhara Tsubomi's family is a hundred years old and counting, and still a prestigious family. Tsubomi is not only the only heir to the Kuzuhara family, but she is also a delinquent kogal who won't listen to her father. For that reason, her father hired her a tutor in order to make her a better heiress.
