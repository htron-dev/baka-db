    "sinopse": "Sori is a special young girl—kind, caring and principled well beyond her years. Unfortunately, these are NOT the personality traits generally celebrated in middle school—especially Sori's, where she's bullied mercilessly for defending the defenseless until she herself becomes a target. To escape, she transfers to a new school where the same old problems begin to play out all over again—that is until a mysterious trail of letters leads Sori on a magical scavenger hunt through the hidden world that exists right below the surface of her new middle school. The mail trail is the work an anonymous guardian angel, whose mission seems to be to provide a soft landing for Sori at her new school. But who is this person? And why did he choose her? With each letter, secrets are revealed and bonds are formed—as Sori learns about friendship, flora, fauna and finding the good in people in this strange new environment.\n\n(Source: LINE Webtoon)",
