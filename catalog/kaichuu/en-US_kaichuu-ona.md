## Sinopse

Tachikawa Tetsuya is a freshman at a new high school and he wants to become a great archer, like his late grandfather, Fudou.

One day, a new transfer student joins his class. In a surprise to everyone, it is a cute girl and not a guy like the rumors were saying... The name is Sasaki Gonzaburou, and... "she"... or maybe "he"... well, this person has some "little" secrets.
