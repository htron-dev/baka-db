## Sinopse

Tachikawa Tetsuya in an incoming freshman at a new high school and he’s a great archer. He wants to join the archery club to meet the one they call “Kami no Ko”, better known as Fudou Gonzaburou. Tachikawa is good, but he’s heard that Fudou is even better. The archery team at this school is in fact very good.

Tachikawa also meets a pretty girl who is already a member of the club (he accidentally walked in on her while she was changing). She’s not very good from the look of things, but she is his senpai and he defers to her. She takes an immediate liking to him and kisses him after practice.

Let’s try just to get past the fact that this girl is actually a boy, named Fudou Gonzaburou…
