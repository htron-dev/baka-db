## Sinopse

With pitch black eyes, Kazuya Shidou is able to show illusions to whoever meets his gaze. If he wishes to, he can even kill people with the sheer terror brought on by these visions. He assumes that his eyes are the reason he was abandoned in New York as an eight-year-old child, but he cannot be certain. He has no memories of his parents or childhood aside from a vague recollection of previously living in Japan.

Ever since Kazuya was picked up off the streets, he has worked as a contract killer alongside his feral partner Keith Grangrey. More valuable than the cash he earns from murders is the promise of information turned up by an ongoing investigation into his past. Coincidentally, the two's targets are usually thugs and other low-life criminals; however, they must also eliminate any witnesses to their killings, whether innocent or not. Kazuya has lost count of the number of his victims and has never shown remorse before nowâ€”but it seems his feelings have slowly been changing.
