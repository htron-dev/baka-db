    "sinopse": "Tsubasa and Eiji have been dating for over 2 years, but their bedroom action hasn't progressed far. Eiji, a man in his 30s who has needs that aren't being met, has been using a substitute, waiting for the day when Tsubasa wants to go all the way. Tsubasa, being younger, fears that his inexperience will turn Eiji away. Can these two come to an agreement in the bedroom? And why is Tsubasa in the living room naked with cat ears?\n\n(Source: MU)",
