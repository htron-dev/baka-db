## Sinopse

1-2. Yuuwaku Sentiment (Alluring Sentiment)
Tsukihara, vice-principal of a high school, is having an issue going about doing his everyday job. That issue being, Subaru Hoshino, an A+ student, and vice-president of the student council... a ''good'' boy... at least when in the presence of his teachers and fellow classmates.

But good ol' Hoshino has a rather naughty and possessive side that only Tsukihara knows. Hoshino, on a daily basis, has been harshly violating the confused and hurt Tsukihara. For no other reason but to fulfill his own sexual agenda. Or is there another reason for Hoshino to demand that his vice-principal spread his legs? Is Tsukihara wrong in thinking that his student hates him?

What will be the result of this dangerous 'one-sided relationship'?

The 2nd part to this story deals with Shin (Subaru's twin brother & the student council president) as he tries to progress in his relationship with the school counselor (Hanada-sensei).
