    "sinopse": "I lost my memory after a car accident—my memory of the past six months is gone! A gorgeous man who stands in front of me says he's my husband. More surprisingly, I am pregnant! I didn't even have a boyfriend before I lost my memory, so how can I be married? My husband treats me gently with love and care, but when he's in my dreams, he's a cold-hearted man. I can't stop crying...! What's that dream all about? Can I indulge myself in this happy life?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
