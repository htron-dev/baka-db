## Sinopse

One upon a time, Norse Gods starting from Odin perished in a great war known as "Ragnarok (Twilight of Gods)," and the Runes (God Crests) that held supernatural powers were passed down to humans.

Force Blaze (Blood oath brother) boy called Lost—A survivor of Norn people, due to the family murder tragedy, gained a Rune and swore to take revenge on people who murdered his family. But, before that, the Bifrost—an elite group under the direct control of the emperor wielding the strongest Runes stand in his way...

A battle of Rune users, is that Karma the schemes of Norse Gods or is it an omen of demise?

Story, revolving around the destined boy is slowly coming alive.
