## Sinopse

Sousuke Aihara grew up without any close friends because his family moved around so much. Now a high school student at Aomine Private High School Academy, an elite school with a 1000% enrollment rate, Sousuke is determined to make close friends. Right away, Sousuke attracts attention from his classmates. The recognition from his peers excites Sousuke at first and makes him look forward to his life as an Aomine student. But, when he discovers that his high school is a so-called "BL academy," Sousuke realizes his classmates notice him so much because he is the #1 bottom of his year!?
