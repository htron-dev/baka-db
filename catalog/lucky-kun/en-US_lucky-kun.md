## Sinopse

High school delinquent Mura must put up with the annoying presence of new stepbrother Subaru when his mother goes away on honeymoon. Dealing with gossip at school is bad enough, but Mura's life is turned upside down by a forbidden locker-room kiss and the publication of an incriminating photo snapped by shounen-ai fangirls.

Takaguchi Satosumi's first BL work.
