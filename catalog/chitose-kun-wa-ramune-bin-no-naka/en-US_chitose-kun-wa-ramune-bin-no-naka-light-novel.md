## Sinopse

Saku Chitose is a womanizing scumbag. Even though he gets insulted in the school’s underground website, he always has a number of friends gathered around him who don’t just excel in their outward appearance but also play the part.

The potential girlfriend with an overwhelming princess aura, Yuuko Hiiragi. The popular and hardworking-type, Yua Uchida. The basketball club’s ace and energetic girl, Haru Aomi...

His time enjoying the start of a new class together with them becomes short-lived when he is entrusted with the recovery of a certain shut-in student.
