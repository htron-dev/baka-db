Even though he gets insulted in the school’s underground website, he always has a number of friends gathered around him who don’t just excel in their outward appearance but also play the part.\n\nHis time enjoying the start of a new class together with them becomes short-lived when he is entrusted with the recovery of a certain shut-in student.\n\n(Source: Square Enix, translated)",
