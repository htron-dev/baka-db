## Sinopse

Saku Chitose is a womanizing scumbag. Even though he gets insulted in the school’s underground website, he always has a number of friends gathered around him who don’t just excel in their outward appearance but also play the part.

His time enjoying the start of a new class together with them becomes short-lived when he is entrusted with the recovery of a certain shut-in student.
