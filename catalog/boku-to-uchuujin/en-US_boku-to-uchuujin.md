## Sinopse

Manabu is a 3rd year middle schooler and former student council president. Suddenly he's in charge of a new student Rui but she is no ordinary girl—she's an alien! Manabu loses the chance to be with his crush Mizuho who now has a thing for Rui and gets nose bleeds from her cuteness. The teacher is of no help, her focus and nose bleeds are on Rui's hot cousin who is also an alien!

The new 2nd year student council body also plays a role in the story. The student president Hikaru is short and hot tempered, he is dating the vice president Nozomi who is tall and gorgeous. The treasurer Kazuma is a good looking guy with a great voice, yet he wears a mask and is madly in love with the cute guy secretary named Tooru!

There is another side story BL with Kazuma and Tooru—Kazuma is slowly wearing Tooru down with his love!
