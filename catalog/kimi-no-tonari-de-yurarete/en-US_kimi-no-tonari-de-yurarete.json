    "sinopse": "\"It seems like there's something about the guy from the head office?\" With those rumors spreading around, Shiina had to be transferred to the local office's General Affairs Department. Every day, he commutes by bus early in the morning to avoid crowds that trigger his trauma. One rainy day, he decides to go home by car with Niwa from the Development Department. However, he couldn't stand it, and ended up getting a panic attack. Even so, Niwa reached out to him without hesitation. \"Whenever you feel uneasy, I'll be right beside you to help.\" From the next morning onwards, Niwa started to take the same bus\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Kitsune ni Kuchizuke",
