    "sinopse": "\"Forever and ever, be by my side, and protect me\"\n\nTakanose Miwa, a high school freshman, is a pretty but clumsy girl who loves manga more than reality. Her love is on the level that she almost have no care about the real world—like doesn't know about school rumors and doesn't believe at romance in the real world. One day she meets Nakajou Kiriatsu, a good-looking guy who looks like the lead male of her favorite manga. Kiriatsu is popular because he is nonchalant, cool and hard to read, though actually, he is just a natural airhead. As Miwa is at risk of getting bullied by a certain bad guy Inokura, Kiriatsu decides to protect her...\n\n(Source: OtakuMole)",
