## Sinopse

Fujimino Daisuke was often pushed around by his tomboy childhood friend Hino Matsuri, but several years later, they meet each other again in college where Daisuke discovers that Matsuri has developed into quite a lovely young woman. But despite that, much to Daisuke's dismay, she has also retained most of the tomboy personality that made her a little difficult to get along with in the past.
