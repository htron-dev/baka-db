## Sinopse

Most people love red hair. It's so vibrant and striking. But not our protagonist, Nora. Many people in her village hate her because she has red hair because of an old legend in the village. Though some people hate her, she still pulls on. But her not -so-ordinary life might become mysterious and dangerous soon... in more ways than one?!
