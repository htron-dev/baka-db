Tohru decides to shoot his shot because Yurihara reminds him of his ideal partner, a younger guy he once used to date, but all his attempts at flirting are met with Yurihara's bluntness and frank rejection. It looks like there's no hope left for Tohru...until he bumps into Yurihara dead drunk on the sidewalk!\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Bad♥Experiment",
