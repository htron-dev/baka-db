    "sinopse": "At war with the adjacent Kioka Republic, the Katjvarna Empire.\n\nIn that region, due to certain circumstances, there was a certain youth unwillingly preparing to take the High Grade Military Officer Exam. His name, Ikta. Disliker of war, lazy, admirer of women.\n\nNo one predicted that that kind of Ikta would later on become a soldier referred to even as a great commander...\n\nHe who survived a world embroiled in war with his superior genius, Ikta. Illustrating his dynamic, dramatic life, a splendid fantasy military history, the curtain is raised at last!\n\n(Source: Baka-Tsuki)",
