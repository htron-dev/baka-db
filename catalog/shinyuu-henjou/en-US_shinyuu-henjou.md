## Sinopse

Shino Satomi is jilted by a girl because she does not feel his "manliness". He is comforted by his best friend, Mamoru Hasegawa, but fails to enter the school of his first choice. Both enter the same all-boy high school, a very unique school because most students are homosexual! They occupy the same room in the dormitory and Mamoru hides his love for Shino and keeps guard against the other students...
(from B-U)
