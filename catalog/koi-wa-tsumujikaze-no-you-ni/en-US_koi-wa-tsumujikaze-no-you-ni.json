    "sinopse": "Amy feels flustered when Hugh asks her to be his secretary for two weeks while his secretary is out on a vacation, in order to combat a seduction from his boss's wife. She hesitantly accepts the job, feeling totally panicky inside. She knows well about Hugh, her brother's best friend. He's good at sports and very smart. He's an attractive man who always dates a gorgeous woman. Spending two weeks with him is as good as jumping into a cyclone. She must try not to let him know how she really feels about him...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
