## Sinopse

Takashi is troubled by the fact that Chizuka wants to hide his relationship with his coworkers. At the same time, his new coworker, Tsutsumi, turns out to be cousin of his previous lover. One night, he ends up too drunk and brought Tsutsumi home. He woke up naked, not remembering what happened between them. But when Tsusumi asks him to introduce him to rich friends of his "lover," he found out that back when he was drunk, he dreamt of Chizuka and asked him to embrace him. However, it was not a dream, and it was Tsusumi who heard his plea to be embraced.
