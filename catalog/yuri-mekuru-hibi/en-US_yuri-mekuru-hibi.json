    "sinopse": "A chance meeting blossomed to love between two girls.\n\nBut it's quite a peculiar couple: Sayuri is ordinary in every way, while her love interest, Yoriko, is a refined lady who seems to be completely lacking in common sense. Graceful attraction between two very different personalities, a sweet and slightly dazzling love story.\n\n(Source: MU)",
