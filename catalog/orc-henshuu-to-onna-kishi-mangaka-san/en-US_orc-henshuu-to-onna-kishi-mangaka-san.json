    "sinopse": "Yeld, an orc sick of life in his dark-fantasy realm, decides to move to Tokyo and become a comics editor. One day, he’s visited by a full-time armored swordswoman, part-time aspiring manga artist—one who gets practically suicidal whenever her work gets rejected! Between her, a tentacle monster summoned as an assistant, and a slime girl with all kinds of helpful manga tools, there’s never been a stranger pack of creators! It’s the most realistic (?) depiction of the manga industry yet!\n\n(Source: Kodansha Comics)",
