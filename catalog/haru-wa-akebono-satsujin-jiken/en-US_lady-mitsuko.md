## Sinopse

Mitsuko was born with a star-shaped birthmark in her palm, signifying that she will climb to greatness - but as a middle-class Japanese girl in the late 1800s, the best thing she can hope for is a respectable marriage. When she meets Heinrich, a handsome, charming Austrian diplomat, her feelings may force her to go against all the rules she has been taught.

Based on the true story of Mitsuko Aoyama, mother of the influential Richard Nikolaus Graf Coudenhove-Kalergi, Lady Mitsuko is a classic tale of culture clash and star-crossed lovers.
