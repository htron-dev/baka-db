    "sinopse": "Every member of Shuuhei's large family, from his parents to his horde of siblings, depends on him for everything, including their meals. This does not, however, stop him from reserving a seat at their table for his closest friend Tomo. As a part of their affectionate household, Tomo loves how the kind, efficient Shuuhei takes care of his family like an esper—without being told, he knows exactly what everyone needs and where to find them. But admiration isn't all that Tomo harbors toward Shuuhei; for a long time now he has also nursed romantic feelings for his childhood friend. He is content being by Shuuhei's side forever, but how long will he be able to keep his love bottled up?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
