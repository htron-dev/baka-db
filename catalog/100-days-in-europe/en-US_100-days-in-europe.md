## Sinopse

Gia is a normal, yet artistically driven girl. While drawing on a train heading to Prague, she meets a peculiar man named Hayden reading a book. Hayden is seen by many as a handsome, larger than life figure, yet he's haunted by the fact that he has no charisma. While Hayden initially was irritated at Gia, they continuously bump into each other during their time in Europe. Are these meetings fateful, or a hindrance on their trip?
