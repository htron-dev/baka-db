## Sinopse

Beautiful, smart, and kind Suzume Kikuo is perfect in every way, the girl of anyone's dreams. But when she asks out her socially awkward childhood friend Akane, his response is a shocker: "You're too perfect." What's a girl to do, except transform into a giant caterpillar and try, try again?
