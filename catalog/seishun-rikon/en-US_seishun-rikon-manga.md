## Sinopse

In the beginning spring of high school life, "Sakono" Ikumi and "Sakono" Touma were utter strangers. The only coincidence is that they have the same family name and are in the same class, but when they noticed the whole class had already started to call them "husband and wife."

This is a story of their love story in a husband and wife relationship, their youth days which lasted for around two years.
