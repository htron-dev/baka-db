## Sinopse

On behalf of his company, Arnold bought an old building for himself and his employees to work in. The building is cheap because of a rumour that the place is haunted, but Arnold isn't really afraid of things like that. It turns out that he knows the cause of the rumour very well; the spirit that haunts the building is his grandfather's, lingering in the world to check on him.

When he was younger he used to meet his grandfather's spriit, and before he moved to New York he had promised him that one day he would be back to take ownership of the building. Despite this, Arnold insists to himself that he didn't buy the building for sentimental reasons, or to keep that promise. He just bought it because of its price and convenient location.

Arnold is a grown man now, and the only thing he cares for are sales and profits.
He acts coldly towards everyone, including his own secretary Millet Adams. What role will Arnold's grandfather's spirit play in the lives of these two people?
