## Sinopse

Junko Harumi went through high school prioritizing her studies, in order to get into the University of Tokyo. Nevertheless, she failed her exams. In the end, she entered a lower-ranking university and ended up working as a teacher at an average cram school. And, by the age of 31, she hasn't gotten married yet!

Since then, Junko's become disheartened, and, despite how unpretentious her current employment is, she's walking on thin ice because of her lack of productivity! Everything seems hopeless, but could it be that a delinquent student would turn her situation all around!?
