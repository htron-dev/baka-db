    "sinopse": "College student Tomoya, dumped by his first love, gets drunk and passes out in the pouring rain, only to be found by cafe-owner Takawa. But... at night, the cafe becomes a bar, where the (all male!) staff become lingerie-clad bunnies! Tomoya ends up working at the cafe, forced to become a bunny himself, and then even gets down and dirty with Takawa! This is a sweet-but-sexy love story between a cool, arrogant older man and an ordinary college student.\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
