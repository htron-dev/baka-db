## Sinopse

Skipping class on the rooftop one day, Shunpei's best friend Fumi tells him he thinks he might be gay. All set to freak out ("Then up 'til now he's been thinking that way about me?!") Shunpei's a bit nonplussed when Fumi's confession turns out...to have nothing to do with him at all! In fact, Fumi's already going out with someone else. Cue adolescent meltdown.
