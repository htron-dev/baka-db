## Sinopse

Even if she's no longer human, I want her love with all my soul.

Colonel Willem Stone is taken behind enemy lines and there endures savage torture to protect his friends. Yet something mysterious happens to him whenever he's at the limit of his pain tolerance... It's as if his soul leaves his body and visits a mysterious woman in an ancient land. Her name is Sarafina. She has strong spiritual powers and is able to sense Will's presence—the two of them form a strong bond. But then Sarafina is transformed into a powerful vampire who never ages... Stay tuned as a unique and mythical romance blossoms!
