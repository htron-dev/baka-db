## Sinopse

Onodera Kensaku, a self taught martial artist, undefeated street fighter gets his ass whipped by a girl. Not by just any girl, but his home room teacher Asato Nanae and her High Left Kick. You'll see brilliant pictures of high quality in shading and facial expressions, with a twist of pervertal activities and one liners that will have your sides spilitting as you follow in the wake of Onodera's adventures to defeat Asato.
