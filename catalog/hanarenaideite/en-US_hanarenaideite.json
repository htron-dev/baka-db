Her fiancé's older brother, Cutter, scorns her and tells her, \"Your upbringing is unfit for the Lord family.\" But after stormy seas shipwreck him and Cheyenne saves him, the two fall madly in love. However, their love quickly becomes tainted. When Martin suggests that Cutter only seduced her to break up their engagement, Cheyenne loses hope and resigns herself to marring Martin. But then, seven years later, her husband dies and she finds herself in a predicament... and Cutter shows up again!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
