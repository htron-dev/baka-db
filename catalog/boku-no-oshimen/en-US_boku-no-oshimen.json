    "sinopse": "When he's attending his favorite idol Alto's concerts, Azusa Kageshima looks like any other idol fanboy, with his glasses and plainclothes—but when he slicks his hair back and dons a three-piece suit, he looks every bit the young yakuza leader he actually is! What happens when he ends up sitting next to a guy in the bar who really looks like the spitting image of his beloved Alto?\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
