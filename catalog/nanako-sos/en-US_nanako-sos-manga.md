## Sinopse

Nanako is a supergirl. She became a friend of Yotsuya and Idabashi, a genius who think all time to money and an otaku. She can fly, has super strength and she is smart and shy. The story unfolds as Nanako encounters a variety of dangerous missions and mysterious events, but her natural sunny disposition helps her through all the incidents as she solves each mystery one after the other.

Grotesque and hilarious manga that became an '80 cult.
