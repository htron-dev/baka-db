## Sinopse

Being with an older lover is hot on just sooo many levels... Seiji-kun is a novice manga artist. He's also completely addicted to the body of the incredibly beautiful Sono-san, despite the fact that Sono-san is a guy. Is this love? Along with the title story, one that paints a tale of youth and emotion, this volume is filled to the brim with stories of overwhelming density, including "Not Just When it's Convenient" and "Let's Go Home." A total of six stories in all.
