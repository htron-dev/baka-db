    "sinopse": "Being with an older lover is hot on just sooo many levels... Seiji-kun is a novice manga artist. He's also completely addicted to the body of the incredibly beautiful Sono-san, despite the fact that Sono-san is a guy. Is this love? Along with the title story, one that paints a tale of youth and emotion, this volume is filled to the brim with stories of overwhelming density, including \"Not Just When it's Convenient\" and \"Let's Go Home.\" A total of six stories in all.\n\n(Source: 801 Media)",
