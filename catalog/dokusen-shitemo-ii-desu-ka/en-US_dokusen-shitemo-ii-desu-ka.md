## Sinopse

Yuu and Ryou have been best friends since they were kids. Yuu is not the most approachable guy, unlike Ryou, who is very popular. It doesn't really bother Yuu that he's the outcast of the class, and he even admits that Ryou is the only person he feels comfortable talking to. But then, Ryou is asked to substitute for a player on the basketball team, meaning that he is not able to spend as much time with Yuu... Yuu is unhappy about this, and he cannot help but lash out at Ryou. Could Yuu's extremely possessive feelings be something more? Is their relationship really just about friendship?
