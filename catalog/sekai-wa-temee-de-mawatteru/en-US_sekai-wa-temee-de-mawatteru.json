    "sinopse": "(1) - (4)\nYou Make My Head Spin (Chapters 1 - 4)\nAs a transfer student to a rough, run-down school populate by delinquents, Shindou tries his best to make friends. When he meets the ill-mannered Yousuke, heartbeats and tempers start to fly! It seems Yousuke is a \"tsundere\"--his gruff exterior hides a shy, sensitive side--and Shindou immediately finds himself dizzy over his combative new crush. Can Yousuke accept a relationship that goes against his tough-guy image? Or will his tendency to lash out at everyone around him drive even the earnest Shindou away for good?\nYousuke and Shindou's back-and-forth bickering is enough to cause their friends to suffer vertigo just trying to follow along. But with every fight comes the chance to make up again--and for this couple there's definitely no exception! (Source: June edition back cover)\n\n(5) - (6)\nSensei! Parts 1 and 2\nExtra school-based story",
