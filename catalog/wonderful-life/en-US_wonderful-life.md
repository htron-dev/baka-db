## Sinopse

Takumi and Tomohiro are a very loving couple, 7 years and running! While Tomohiro is a not-so-popular illustrator, Takumi, however, is one of the elite. Because of this, they're only able to meet once weekly, and immediately after sex, Takumi leaves! Tomohiro can't help but wonder about this kind of relationship with Takumi, was Takumi forced into it by his selfish feelings or...is there more than meets the eye?
