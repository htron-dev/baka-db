## Sinopse

I, Renako Amaori, threw away my middle school loner self and made my high-school debut. But since deep down I'm still a gloomy character, I can't get used to the cheery character lifestyle that I always wanted, and feels like I can't breathe! It's then that through an unexpected turn of events, I ended up sharing my worries with Mai Ouzuka, the school's superstar, and we become secret friends. It seemed like school life would be bearable with Mai around, but...

"I fell in love with you."
"Wait! What happened to being friends?!"

A romantic relationship is unstable! It's impossible! I want to make the greatest friends and enjoy high school life! But it doesn't seem like Mai is going to give up...

"Let's have a match to decide whether being friends or lovers are more fitting for us."

And that's how the nonstop romcom with our way of being on the line began!
