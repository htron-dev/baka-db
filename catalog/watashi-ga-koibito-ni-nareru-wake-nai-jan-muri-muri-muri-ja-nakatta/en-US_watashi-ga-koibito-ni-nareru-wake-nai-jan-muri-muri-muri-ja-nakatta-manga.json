    "sinopse": "Longing to be a normie, I, Renako Amaori, am finally making my high school debut after working so hard for it. However due to my communication impairment I have a gloomy aura, and after being in the normie group day in day out, I got so exhausted and said \"I can't do this anymore!\" I've reached my limit!\n\nDuring that time I accidentally met the top student of our school, perfect in face and figure unrivaled in sword and pen, our school's best high school girl, Mai Ouzuka, and we found in each other someone who we could open up to and talk about our own troubles. What a nice friend I made, now I can surely get back on my own feet... is what I thought!\n\n\"It seems that you, even as a girl, have made me fall in love with you.\"\n\n\"...What?!\"\n\nMai suddenly confessed to me.\n\nWait! What about our friendship?!\n\nThus we have feelings we cannot tell each other, friendship or a romantic relationship, we're presenting each other the goods about them and put them into practice to see what kind of relationship works best for us.\n\nCan I succeed, or will my best high school life ...!!\n\n(Source: Shueisha, translated)",
