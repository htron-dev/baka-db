## Sinopse

When did love start? Kisses tasting of cigarettes. The view from the veranda. In this small corner of town, they gradually fall in love.

Tsubaki, who recently moved into town due to a job transfer. A gay couple living next door, Toyohashi and Takatsuki. And Tsubaki's elusive senior, Azuma. While bewildered in an unfamiliar surrounding, Tsubaki's naturally rigid heart slowly unfastens for the "first time," and he starts knowing what love is.
