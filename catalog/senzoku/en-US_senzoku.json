That is why she hired her gourmet classmate Takada Miyoshi since grade school to serve as her exclusive personal chef. It was supposed to be a simple relationship of \"cook\" and \"taster\", but now that they are in high school...??\n\nAlso included in the volume is a one-shot titled \"Watashi teki Zettai Inryoku ken\" about a high school girl and her classmate who seem to always be drawn together under all circumstances as if by the force of gravity.",
