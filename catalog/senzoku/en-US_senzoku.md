## Sinopse

Inadvertently trained by her now deceased mother, who was a very good cook, Yuge Sumika cannot stomach food that is not of the utmost highest quality. That is why she hired her gourmet classmate Takada Miyoshi since grade school to serve as her exclusive personal chef. It was supposed to be a simple relationship of "cook" and "taster", but now that they are in high school...??

Also included in the volume is a one-shot titled "Watashi teki Zettai Inryoku ken" about a high school girl and her classmate who seem to always be drawn together under all circumstances as if by the force of gravity.
