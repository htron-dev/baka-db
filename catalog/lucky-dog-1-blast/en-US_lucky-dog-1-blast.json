    "sinopse": "Gian Carlo is thrown into prison once again. However, he excels in prison break and is known for his miraculous escapes—so good, it's his favourite past time and he's even nicknamed \"Lucky Dog\" for his fortune. But now he is given a bigger task. A letter from the CR:5 boss wants Gian to get four of their executives out of prison. If Gian succeeds, he will be promoted to boss of the group—that is, if he can get everyone out safe.",
