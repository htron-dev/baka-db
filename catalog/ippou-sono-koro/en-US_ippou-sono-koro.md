## Sinopse

Kuroishi, the director of an evil organization that fights against magical girls, is serious, cute, and sexy despite being a bad guy. However, he's accidentally locked up alone with his talented and handsome subordinate, Akaya, in a room where they can't leave unless they get laid... What's to be done about this predicament?! (We have no choice!) This is the most popular magical and erotic BL!
