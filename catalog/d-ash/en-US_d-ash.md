## Sinopse

Tsukasa, Tajima, Katsu, and newcomer Sae, were all members of the Hentai ShonenDai (Perverted Boy's club) at the tender age of 11. But as they grow older, how will each of their lives change? Will they grow apart, or stay true to the (perverted) passions they shared as kids. D-ASH is a story about the adventures these boys will have trying to grow up as fast as they can, being as naughty as possible all the while.
