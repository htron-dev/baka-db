## Sinopse

One day, Mizuki gets rejected by school prince and student body president Seima Takajo. While sobbing his eyes out behind the school, he meets Fuji, a fierce-looking upperclassman who wears a surgical mask. The older boy is awkward, yet kind as he desperately tries to comfort Mizuki. "I want to tell Seima how I feel, so help me!" Mizuki says, demanding Fuji's cooperation. Despite his appearance, Fuji's actually pretty soft, and he even thinks the sharp-tongued, mischievous Mizuki is cute. At some point, Mizuki starts losing track of his goals... Fierce, weak, and sickly, can a prince with a triple handicap find happiness with a mischievous "princess" of a boy!?
