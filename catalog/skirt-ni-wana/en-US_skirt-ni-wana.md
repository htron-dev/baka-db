## Sinopse

The effeminate Aoi Makise has never been interested in women, but he wants to experience pleasure like one—perhaps as a result of him being forced to witness his neighbor's sexual exploits as a child. Now as a teenager, he dresses in a woman's school uniform and masturbates.

One day, when his class changes seats, he ends up sitting in front of Kouichi Takano, a classmate who begins asking Makise if he is gay. Through their continued interactions, Makise discovers that Takano is actually infatuated with him, and they share their first heated kiss in the bathroom. Deciding to invite Takano to his place, the two end up in a steamy situation where Takano confesses his love to Makise. But with both of them so awkward in matters of the heart, how will their relationship ever work?
