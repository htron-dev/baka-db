## Sinopse

Mitokomon is the empror's trusted man with a high sense of justice. He is sent to travel around the country in order to observe the quality of life in each province and run a check on the official's performances and report back to the empror. Along with him are sent two bodyguards, Kaiko (known for his extraordinary power) and Tsuke (known for his amazing swordsmanship). The three men, traveling unknown, face lots of adventure on their journey to bring justice to the citizens and eliminate corruption from the governing system.
