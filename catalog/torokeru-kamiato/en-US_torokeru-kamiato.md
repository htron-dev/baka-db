## Sinopse

Eichi is a university student who likes to hang around flashy people. He gets irritated by the fact that Jinno is always silently staring at him without saying anything every time they go to a drinking party. Eichi successfully got Jinno drunk to the point of getting sick one night. However, he was unexpectedly appointed to look after him. Not only that, Jinno pounced him while at the pub's toilet?!
