    "sinopse": "Shoemaker Jin has one problem: he can't make shoes with ornate and glamorous design due to his serious and stubborn character. When he asked his childhood friend Kei for his help, Kei suggested that Jin lose his virginity in order to bring out his sex appeal. But rather than losing his virginity, it's more like Kei took his virginity?!\n\n(Source: Tokyo Mangasha, translated)",
