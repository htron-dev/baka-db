## Sinopse

With kind guests, a reliable staff, and carefully selected ingredients, Tesshou's bistro is his ideal gastronomic oasis. Tesshou's life abruptly changes after he helps an injured cat. A few days after the cat vanishes, a young man named Nekota appears claiming to be the injured cat. Driven to pay Tesshou back for his kindness, Nekota asks to work at the bistro. Tesshou reluctantly hires this mysterious... catboy? But, who really is Nekota and why does he like Tesshou so much?
