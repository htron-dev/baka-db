## Sinopse

Okamoto Momone is a first year student at an art school living on her own although she's close to her family. She's studying art to follow in the footsteps of her father, who left his wife and three children (Momo is the youngest) some years back. One day her mother summons her and her siblings home to say that their father has resurfaced, sending divorce papers to their mother. It's a bit of a surprise, but he's been gone a long time and everyone is used to it.
