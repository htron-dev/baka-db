    "sinopse": "\"Data Munchkin\": Oddballs who would merrily attempt killing God if the data showed it to be possible.\n\nErich, one of these Data Munchkins, a reincarnated boy, schemes to turn himself into an ideal broken character using his character build authority which he was blessed with on the occasion of being reincarnated into a different world. While hanging out with his aggressively seductive childhood friend and taking care of his brocon younger sister, Erich racks his brain as he analyzes data from head to toe, cleverly managing experience points trying to fumble his way onto a heinous broken combo build. But sooner than he thinks the story(session) begins to unfold as Erich throws himself into the fray fighting(rolls dice) to protect those who he holds dear?!\n\nThe curtains rise on the adventures of data munchkin of Henderson-scale plot derailment!\n\n(Source: Overlap, translated)",
