## Sinopse

Akida is truly miserable. After three years, he's been reunited with Nao, who has succeeded as a patisserie and is now a formidable rival at Akida's department store. In the past, Akida's cold anger turned into love. But Nao doesn't know that... A love story of two male hearts that swing between pride and heartache! (Source: Juné)
