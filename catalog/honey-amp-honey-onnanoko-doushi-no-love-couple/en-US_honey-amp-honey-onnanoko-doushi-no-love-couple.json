    "sinopse": "Honey & Honey is a realistic look at an adult lesbian couple living in Japan; to be precise, it's autobiographical. The artwork is simple, but hopefully the plot (and the information the manga imparts) will be enough compensation for those who don't like that style of drawing. This manga is similar to Plica, though it's not a 4-panel manga.\n\n(Source: Lililicious)",
