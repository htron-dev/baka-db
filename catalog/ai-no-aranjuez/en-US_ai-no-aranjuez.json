    "sinopse": "As rising singles figure skating hot stars Tsutsumi Hajime and Kaiya Makiko continue to achieve bigger successes in their careers, they cannot help but wish for their friend and rival, Kurokawa Mitsugu's return to the ice after a tragic accident on the rink left him mentally too unstable to skate again. No words or invitations have convinced Kurokawa, but a chance encounter with a nameless young girl who spontaneously jumped in unannounced to skate an attention-grabbing program at an exhibition gala event stirred his long since silent desire to feel the ice underneath him again... A classic tale of growth and drama in the competitive and riveting world of figure skating!\n\nNote: Volume 5 of this series contains a one-shot titled \"8 Gatsu wa Koi Gurui\" about three guys in an aspiring band and a dorky young girl, who live together for a summer to run a small shop.\n\nNote 2: Volume 7 also contains a short story titled \"Tokeidai Doori\" about a ski jumper and two high school girlfriends who live in Hokkaido.",
