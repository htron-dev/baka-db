## Sinopse

Wish #1—Nothing. Megan likes her life just as it is—predictable and safe.

Wish #2—No, really. Nothing! Who is this mysterious guy who keeps trying to make her make wishes, anyway?

Wish #3—Well, he's kind of cute. And he is willing to make her wishes come true—if only Megan will let him.
