## Sinopse

One day Fumiki meets a strange dog at the factory. A dog who can understand human speech and push blades out from its forehead. The mysterious number "23" is carved onto its ear. Although there are many unsolved mysteries about the beast, the two begin to communicate and build trust. "23" arrived at the town following the voice of a higher power which said, "Observe mankind." Meanwhile a giant organization is moving behind the scenes to capture "23." The leader Kiryu wants "23" so that he can control "Tokoyonokuni, the land across the ocean of the dead, ancestors and human spirits. A paradise of eternal life and decadence."
