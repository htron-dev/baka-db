## Sinopse

In the midst of a firefight to save a hostage from religious fanatics, Yuri, a member of the police force, steps forward to challenge them "alone" but when his comrade Mia intervenes to aid him, things only get stranger.

As Mia attempts to evade her superior's criticism over her methods, she collides head on with the Mad Scientist, Doctor Over. The Doctor seems fascinated by her, and as his inhuman army attacks Mia and her allies, she finds herself trapped. As an unusual blade pierces her chest she thinks she's going to die... but it seems that this is only the beginning.
