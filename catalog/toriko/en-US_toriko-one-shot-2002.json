    "sinopse": "The story starts off in a serene location as an antelope drinks from a watering hole, just then half the creature's body is bitten off by a large Python Tiger, the beast then prepares to eat the rest of its prey until it senses the presence of a fierce beast and quickly jumps back into the water to avoid death with even the antelope corpse following suit.\n\nElsewhere, the Gourmet Hunter Toriko is seen dining in a luxury hotel where he is being briefed by the young chef Komatsu on a request to capture a Baron Bison. Toriko perks up at the idea of capturing it and complies with the request and prepares to set off in the morning.\n\n[From Toriko Wiki]",
