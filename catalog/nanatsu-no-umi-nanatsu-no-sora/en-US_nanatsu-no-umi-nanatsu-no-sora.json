    "sinopse": "Tyrian's stepfather (a notorious womanizer) decides to remarry, and his victim is a sickeningly sweet and innocent girl named.... Juliet. But the girl is kidnapped off of Tyrian's ship, first by pirates and then by more pirates in the form of our dashing Luminous Red Benedict. The neatly woven threads of conspiracy which have been supporting Tyrian's life begin to unravel, and he flees to Spain at last. Captain Red redoubles his pursuit.\n\n(Source: Translated Treasures)",
