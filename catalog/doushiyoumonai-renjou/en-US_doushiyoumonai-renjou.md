## Sinopse

Outgoing Tsurugi and the shy Kiyoo are the best of friends. As Kiyoo's attraction to his friend grows stronger, so does the pressure to be "normal." Unable to come to terms with these feelings, Kiyoo and his friend's relationship arrives at a breaking point. Tsurugi disappears and Kiyoo resumes his life as a "normal" person... That is until one day, with high school graduation just around the corner, Kiyoo is shocked to find that his childhood friend has waltzed back into his life as if nothing ever happened...?
