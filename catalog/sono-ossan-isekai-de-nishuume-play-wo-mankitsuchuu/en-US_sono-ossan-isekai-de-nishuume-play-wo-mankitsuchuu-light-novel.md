## Sinopse

Yuuya is a middle-aged adventurer without talent. As hardworking as he is, he spends his days garnering little reward. One day, his memories of being a corporate slave return and he realizes that he has reincarnated into a world of the video game he had been obsessed with in his previous life. As a bonus for resetting his level, his stats rise and the limits increase to the maximum. As a result, his life receives a turnaround. Using his knowledge of the game as well as his 10 years of experience as an adventurer, all will be in his grasp using the skills he has forged. At last, in his third life, the time has come for the old man to be rewarded for his efforts.
