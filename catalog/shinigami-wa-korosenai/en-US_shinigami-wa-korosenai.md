Since childhood Eiji has always had accidents that would have been fatal, but he always survived unscathed. Because he sees things that normal people don't see, he realizes that there's a mysterious shadow that always saves him. But what is it? So he decided to find out what this mysterious shadow was and wanted to thank that shadow. And to call him, he tried to jump off the balcony of his apartment. Here comes the handsome God of Death appearing before him. Will Eiji be able to thank him?
