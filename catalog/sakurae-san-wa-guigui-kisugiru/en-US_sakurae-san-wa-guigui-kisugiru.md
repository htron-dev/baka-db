## Sinopse

Sakurae-san is seemingly perfect, but she's completely hopeless when it comes to expressing her love to her fiancé, Haruto. Her idea of taking their relationship to the next level is things like flashing her boobs at him in public, and wearing a micro bikini at school in order to surprise him.
