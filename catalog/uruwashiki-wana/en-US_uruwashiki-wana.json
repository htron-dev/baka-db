    "sinopse": "Itsuki was one of the potential successors of the Toudou family, but was chased out of the family after being framed. Unknown to Itsuki, Kyouya, another potential successor, has been sending money to help him for the past year. Under any circumstances, the members of the Toudou family should never accept another person’s gratitude. Thus, Kyouya wants Itsuki to obey him for the help he has received from Kyouya. Is this a trap set up by Kyouya or does Kyouya really wants to help Itsuki to return to the family?\n(from Attractive Fascinante)",
