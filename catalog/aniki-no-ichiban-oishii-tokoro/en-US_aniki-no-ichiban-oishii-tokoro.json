    "sinopse": "Azuma Sakuragi is deeply in love... with his twin brother, Miyabi! Miyabi is a pure genius at archery, but pretty much useless at everything else. You would think Azuma would be fed up with taking care of him all the time, but instead, he's happy to spend as much time with Miyabi as he can... until one day, the A.C. in Miyabi's room breaks down, and Miyabi has to sleep in Azuma's room... and share his bed! Can Azuma keep himself from secretly touching his brother?\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
