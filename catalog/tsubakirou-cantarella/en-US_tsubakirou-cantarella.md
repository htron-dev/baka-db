## Sinopse

Distinguised Noble Son, Shingo, as a person under debt, sold himself to Maruyama Red Light District’s greatest male prostitute brothel, Tsubakirou! Furthermore, a few days ago he had met an impolite man. Zenichirou’s appearance...!

With a resistant heart and an arrogant attitude, unable to defy the shrewd man who divided the red-light district, Shingo has taken training from Zenichiro to become the best courtesan...?

The unexplainably beautiful and erotic techniques of a romance story!
