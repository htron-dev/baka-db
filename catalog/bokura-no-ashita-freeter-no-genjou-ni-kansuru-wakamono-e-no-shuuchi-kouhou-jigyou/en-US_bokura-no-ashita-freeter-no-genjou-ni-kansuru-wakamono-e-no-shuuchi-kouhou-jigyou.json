    "sinopse": "The video centers on Takumi Shimamoto, a 22-year-old freeter who quit college in his second year under the pretense of finding something that interests him to pursue. He's been working part-time jobs for about two years. He runs into a classmate from high school named Ayaka Yoshimura. She is about to graduate from college and is thinking about her job prospects. Ayaka is considering doing part-time work for the time being because there is not a job in particular that she wants to do.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
