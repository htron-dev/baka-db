## Sinopse

I went back to the classroom to take the H-Game I forgot to bring back home, but met a Devil King instead!? Also, I was named the Hero, and from that point on, forced to have a hot-blooded adventure! Yet, I strangely spent these days lazily. The confused Devil King and H-game addicted juvenile Hero. The series of aimless comedy begins now!
