## Sinopse

Volume 1
The mysterious Shadow and his assistant Maria run a small pawnshop. Every customer of their shop experiences unforeseen consequences because of his or her dark side. What they pawn there may be something that they are not supposed to let go. Nightmares for Sale Volume 1 contains five nightmarish tales of horror, plus the bonus nightmare "Jealousy In A Bottle." Afraid of nightmares? Be afraid. Be VERY afraid!

Volume 2
Welcome once again to Shadow’s pawnshop, where love and dreams are sold in the form of mysterious magical items. But, buyers beware, for nothing comes without a price! Containing six all new disturbing tales of horror that delve into the deepest, darkest realms of human nature, Nightmares for Sale Volume 2 shows just what price you have to pay when you bargain with the Devil.
