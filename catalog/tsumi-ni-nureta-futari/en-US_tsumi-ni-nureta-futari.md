## Sinopse

This tale of forbidden fruit is ripe with angst and taboo.

Nineteen year old college girl Kasumi is traveling in Italy after a painful breakup. In Rome, she meets a handsome Japanese man and, knowing nothing about him, not even his name, she has a one-night stand with him. There should have been no chance of them meeting again, but when Kasumi gets back to Japan, she learns that fate has played a cruel trick! The man she slept with was Yoshiki... her younger brother!! And that's only the start of it...
