## Sinopse

It should have be my first time, but for some reason, my body reacts to the pleasure like it knows it all too well! This isn't me! I fell down a stairway and accidentally slipped ten years ahead in time... where I found out that at some point I get married to a childhood friend who I do nothing but fight with! Then, he suddenly kisses me deeply, and I lose all control... and despite my virgin heart, my mature body accepts all of him... why is my body enjoying this so much?! What's going on?!
