    "sinopse": "He was an elite from the big city who had status, money, and women. However, when an investment in a share-house fails, he loses everything! At his lowest point of despair, he meets Tao, a brazen, young gay man who runs a share-house. \"If you pretend to be a couple with me, I can help you.\" To take back his elite life and lost pride, as well as gain the know-how of running a share-house, he has to accept Tao's insane conditions!?\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)",
