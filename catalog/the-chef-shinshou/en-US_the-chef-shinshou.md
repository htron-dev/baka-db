## Sinopse

Ajizawa is a renowned master chef, but he doesn’t have a restaurant. He is a "fixer," a man who travels from place to place fixing menus and restaurants much like Gordon Ramsey, and he charges a fortune to do it. If your menu must be perfect to impress a foreign client, a head of state, or just a neighbor, Ajizawa is the man to do it. But why does he do it? Is it only the money, or is his mission much deeper...
