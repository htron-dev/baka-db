## Sinopse

Oumori High School is full of delinquents, but none of them can beat its 35th head, Meriken. First year student Kenny tries to challenge Meriken, but gets beaten up pretty bad. However, by chance Meriken eats Kenny's lunch, and it was so delicious, it was as if he received a heavy punch! Kenny realized that his cooking skills can become his weapon. He swore to make the way to the other students' hearts through their stomachs, and rise to the top of Oumori!
