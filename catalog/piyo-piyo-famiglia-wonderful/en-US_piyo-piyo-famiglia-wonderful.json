Moreover, these two babies are really attached with their older sister, which only make them cuter! Just watch how they race against each other every single day to get into Kana-chan’s arms. If you look closer you’ll notice the evilness of Mayu-chan but don’t think that Sae-chan hasn’t had a bad side either. Their days continue to fill with love and affection from their family. However, there will be a guy who will fall for Kana-chan and Mayu-chan will dubbed this guy as her rival against her sister’s affection!",
