It turns out that angels do indeed live there, and after an accident, an angel named Un offers Botan her halo as a snack. After eating it, Botan discovers it had some bizarre side-effects, causing her to regularly \"give birth\" to colorful mushrooms. Is this the life of an angel!?\n\n(Source: MU)",
