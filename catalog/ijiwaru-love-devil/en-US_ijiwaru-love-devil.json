    "sinopse": "Yui is a cute middle school girl who is happily surprised when her papa brings her home a plush teddy bear as a gift. She gets quite the shock to discover that it is posessed by a demon! But Jyan is a cute winged bishounen demon, so things aren’t that bad :) Yui and Jyan get along fairly well, even thought it can be difficult to hide him from her family! The usual wacky hijinks that one might expect to have when one gets their own demonic teddy bear ensue. Jyan follows Yui to school, jealous rivals appear, sinister demons threaten Yui’s happiness, etc. But through it all, Jyan and Yui start to really like each other… (Source: ShoujoManga)",
