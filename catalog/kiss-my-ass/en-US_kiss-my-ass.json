    "sinopse": "From an outsider's perspective, Teruki Yakushiji is an average sixteen-year-old high-schooler. He lives an ordinary school life: a couple of friends, a crushâ€”the usual. But beneath his disguise as a normal student lies a dark secret that he has not told anyone about, a curse that he fights every second of his life: Teruki has hemorrhoids.\n\nFearful of word about his condition getting out, Teruki avoids visits to the hospital and deals with the pain through subtle coping mechanisms and sheer determination. Shiori Miura, a girl at his school, notices his unusual abdominal behavior and discovers his secret, offering to help Teruki. Teruki is glad to have someone shoulder the pain with him, but what are Miura's true intentions?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
