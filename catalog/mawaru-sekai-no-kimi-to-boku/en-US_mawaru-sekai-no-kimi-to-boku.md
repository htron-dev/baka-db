A collection of oneshots:

1. Mawaru Sekai no Kimi to Boku
   When they were very young, Keito and Tomoya made a promise to be together forever, but after Tomoya disappeared one morning, Keito lost his faith in people. Years later in high school, Tomoya makes a sudden return, but now Keito's no longer a cute little kid Tomoya seems to have forgotten who he is!

2. Masaka no Futari
   High-school student Akito is too cute! So cute that he's been traumatized by attackers both male and female. When Akito's mother convinces laid back college student Kunugi to tutor him, is Akito destined to be attacked again? Or is Kunugi really just a nice guy?

3. Lucky Item

   When he was small, Ran was found at the brink of death by Byakuroku-sama, a non-human man with beautiful eyes. Byakuroku-sama now employs Ran as a jack-of-all-trades, often undertaking dangerous missions and depending heavily on his loyalty. What happens when that loyalty comes into question?
