    "sinopse": "When I pulled out the holy sword, I noticed the handsome prince?!\n\nEleanor, a maid who works at the royal palace, pulls out the holy sword of the legendary goddess, which is given to the hero who protects the country from the demon king, which no one could pull out for a thousand years. However, now is a peaceful era that does not require the success of heroes. If you become a hero, you will lose your job?! I'm going to assume that I didn't gently put the holy sword back, but I was found by a handsome but unfriendly prince...\n\n(Source: Square Enix, translated)",
