## Sinopse

"I'll do anything for you, Riko." After her father's death, Riko suddenly finds herself living with his parting gift: a male humanoid robot called Akito. Booting up this high-functioning robot turns Riko's calm and mundane life upside-down! Although she finds him annoying, the more she watches him, the harder it gets to turn him off... Then, one day, the curious and rather touchy-feely Akito says... "Can kissing convey my love for you?" ...What's with this robot? Turns out he has a secret function...!
