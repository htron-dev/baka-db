## Sinopse

The stage is set in the prestigious Private Jyoushioka High School—or more commonly known as Joshi High. It became co-educational a few years ago, but females still heavily outnumber the males. The number of males could be easily counted. While one would think males would be pampered in such a harem school, the reality is far from being heavenly. It was the world of female domination.
