    "sinopse": "A happy dinner table, just for two. But, there’s a time limit...\nKoutarou Nagiri works at the deli at the grocery store. One day, he notices that the salary man he sees all the time, Wataru Takano, always buys the dishes that he makes. When Takano’s favorite food at the deli is sold out, he’s pretty disappointed, so Nagiri calls out to him to invite him to dinner. However, Nagiri finds himself gradually becoming attracted to Takano...\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)",
