## Sinopse

At 28 years old, Nireko has worked part-time for three years at the workshop of the umbrella craftsman Kiyota. But she's had a crush on Kiyota for 20-odd years, even though he's now married. She isn't considered a "regular employee" there and is job hunting, so she sees no future for her love life or job. Then she's suddenly tapped to take over her family's brush shop? "A brush shop... that's so dull!" And so begins the apprenticeship of Nireko, youngest of three daughters, to become an artisan brush-maker.
