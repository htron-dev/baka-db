30 years has passed since the beginning of the great war between the people of "Jade" and "Kokuyou", which ended with Kokuyo as the winners and the losers of Jade becoming their slaves. And now the emperor has decided to perform a gladiator's tournament called "Shaba Juu Rengoku", and has proclaimed that the tournament's winner will receive the title of "Shaba-ou" and also the emperor's throne. Meanwhile, a certain one-eyed swordman has become popular among the gladiators...
