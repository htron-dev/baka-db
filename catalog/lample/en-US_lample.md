## Sinopse

One day, Yosugara, an antique shopkeeper, met the cute little girl Riu. However, Riu can't go very long between sleeping, and can't control when she falls asleep. Then the two come across a genie trapped in a lamp, and break the seals that bind him there. The genie, Lample, can make your wishes come true. However, in return, he requires the life force of the one making the wish. So Riu enters into a contract with Lample, but what is her wish!?
