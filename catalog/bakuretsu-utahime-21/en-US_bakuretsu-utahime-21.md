## Sinopse

My name is Hanamura Megu, and a whirlwind circumstance landed me on a star search audition!! Once on stage, I had so much fun, and I was like one with the audience. Sadly, nobody walked away a winner. But me and three other girls caught the attention of a charismatic producer, and now he's giving us intensive training...!? (Summary from Shoujomagic)
