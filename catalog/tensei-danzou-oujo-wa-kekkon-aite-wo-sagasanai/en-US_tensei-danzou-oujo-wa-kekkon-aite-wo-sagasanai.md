## Sinopse

Princess Alicia doesn't want to be married off in an arranged marriage, so she agrees to an impossible wager with her mother: Enter an all-boys school as a "boy" and find real love among a number of approved candidates. What she doesn't plan on is falling in love with handsome Lucius, a non-approved guy who figures out her secret! Oh, and she realizes she's a reincarnation of a romance-novel-loving girl who is living in one of her favorite stories! Find out what happens next in this comical love fantasy!
