Written by Tomonori Sugihara. The light novels, much like the manga, differ from the TV series in various ways.

Renton Thurston is a young 14 year old who is tired of his boring life and spends his time lifting, an extreme form of aerial hoverboarding. One day, a large mecha known as an LFO crash lands in his grandfather's garage and a beautiful young girl named Eureka emerges. This begins a journey that will change both of their lives...
