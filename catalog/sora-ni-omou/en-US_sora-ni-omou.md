## Sinopse

A youth "library" story, where imagination colors reality!

Sakura Kouta, a high school student who absolutely hates words, ends up working as a library chief to temporarily replace his grandfather by some strange coincidence. Following the suggestion of his classmate Aimochi Miyu, he happens to share a certain secret!

In the sea of books where creations and thoughts cross one youth story quietly raises its curtains.
