    "sinopse": "Tori, Ashi, and Chika are friends with a family-like dynamic. They gather for their regular drinking party and talk about Tori's usual carefree attitude, Ashi's usual denial of self and his narcissist boyfriend-not-boyfriend, and Chika's usual not getting any from his boyfriend of one year. Every day is a new update on each other's lives and how they all approach romance from extremely different angles.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)\n\nIncluded one-shots: Kawaii Kimi to wa Mamanaranai (You're Cute But You're Unruly), Junai de Shibararetai.
