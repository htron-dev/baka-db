## Sinopse

As a kid, Himukai Hinata met a minor mountain god at her little shrine. She has a long name, but he calls her "Hanoa-sama." Now Hinata is 14, and Hanoa-sama has moved in with him. She is in danger since gods, without worship, don't have the energy to continue to exist. Hinata wracked his brain trying to find a way to help her, and finally settled on making her a blog and establishing an online fan base. Specifically, he puts up sexy content of her, to take advantage of the fact that she's really cute. The infusions of attention from her fans help keep her strong enough to protect Hinata from all the other malicious supernatural spirits.
