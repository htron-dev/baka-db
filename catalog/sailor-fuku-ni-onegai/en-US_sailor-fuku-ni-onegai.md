## Sinopse

When Hina hits a homerun ball and goes to get it back she realizes she has damaged a shrine with the baseball. When she touches the object inside the shrine the object is absorbed into her and she becomes the shrine's god. Now she is protected by the shrine's guard dogs, Shishi and Koma. Along the way she meets other spirits, guardians, and the legendary nine tailed fox.
