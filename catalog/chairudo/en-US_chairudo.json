    "sinopse": "Chairudo are childlike people (even when they have become adults) with each an exceptional supernatural gift, a power. Some are \"firestarters\" for example. The main character, Hinagata Heiji, looks like a loser, but looks are deceptive. He has the uncanny ability to bring to life every inanimate object by bringing the object in touch with his blood. He wanders around, enlisting himself in a school from time to time (after all, he looks like a child). But every \"chairudo\" has got its own territory and conflicts between them, especially about the females, are numerous.\n(Source: Manga Volume)",
