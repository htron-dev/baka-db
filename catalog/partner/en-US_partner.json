    "sinopse": "Shoujo manga that quickly turns dark. When the story begins, we are introduced to identical twins, Ousawa Nae (oldest) and Ousawa Moe (youngest). The twins are best friends with a set of fraternal twins, Soeda Takeshi (younger) and Soeda Ken (older). Nae likes Ken, who happens to be the boyfriend of her twin sister. Typical shoujo plot right? Wrong. Things take a quite a twist shortly thereafter.\n\n(Source: J-Fan Manga)",
