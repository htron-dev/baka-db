## Sinopse

Nizaki Eito was just about to sneak back into the dorm after finishing his part-time job and ran into the student council president, Fujima. Because it was against the school rules, Nizaki agreed to become Fujima’s pet. When Nizaki started to get really popular, Fujima got jealous and decided to let go of him. However, Nizaki threatened Fujima instead and wanted Fujima to become his pet. Was it for love or for revenge? (Source: Attractive Fascinante)
