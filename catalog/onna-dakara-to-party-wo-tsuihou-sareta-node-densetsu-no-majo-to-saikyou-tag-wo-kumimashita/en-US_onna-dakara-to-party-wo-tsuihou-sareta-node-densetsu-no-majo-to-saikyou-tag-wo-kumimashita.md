## Sinopse

"I'm kicking you out of our party because you're a woman."

"What?!"

"Women really should be healers, after all. A sorcerer's a bit..."

"Whaaaaaatt???!!!"

Female adventurer Tanya, who became a high class sorcerer after a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, was suddenly kicked out of her adventurer party "because she's a woman." While bombarding the wasteland with super-advanced magic out of frustration, the legendary grand witch Laplace appeared and said, "Shall we form a party?"

"Seriously?!"

"However, if you’re a sorcerer our characters will overlap, so be a magic swordsman. I've made it so you'll start at the maximum level."

"Seriously???!!! (while pulverizing a last-boss-class dragon)"

The slapstick light-yuri adventure of the (legendary) grand witch and (max level) magic swordswoman starts here!
