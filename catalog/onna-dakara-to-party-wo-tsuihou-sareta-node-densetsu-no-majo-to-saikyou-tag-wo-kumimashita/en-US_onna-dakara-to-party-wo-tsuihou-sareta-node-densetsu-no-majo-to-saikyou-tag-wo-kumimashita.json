    "sinopse": "\"I'm kicking you out of our party because you're a woman.\"\n\n\"What?!\"\n\n\"Women really should be healers, after all. A sorcerer's a bit...\"\n\n\"Whaaaaaatt???!!!\"\n\nFemale adventurer Tanya, who became a high class sorcerer after a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, was suddenly kicked out of her adventurer party \"because she's a woman.\" While bombarding the wasteland with super-advanced magic out of frustration, the legendary grand witch Laplace appeared and said, \"Shall we form a party?\"\n\n\"Seriously?!\"\n\n\"However, if you’re a sorcerer our characters will overlap, so be a magic swordsman. I've made it so you'll start at the maximum level.\"\n\n\"Seriously???!!! (while pulverizing a last-boss-class dragon)\"\n\nThe slapstick light-yuri adventure of the (legendary) grand witch and (max level) magic swordswoman starts here!\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
