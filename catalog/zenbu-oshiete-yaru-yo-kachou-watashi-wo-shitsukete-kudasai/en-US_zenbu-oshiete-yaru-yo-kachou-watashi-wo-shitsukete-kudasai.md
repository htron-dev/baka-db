## Sinopse

Yuriko Tanaka, a 29-year-old with no experience with men, signs up for an adult tutoring course where she learns everything about romance in return for exposing everything about herself. All her friends are in a rush to get married, and some of them are already having kids, so what can she do to find a normal, healthy romance? That's when she discovers a company-sponsored lecture course on "Adult Relationships," and decides to take a chance. When she arrives at the lecture, she's shocked to find her division manager and crush, Mr. Yoshizaki, is the instructor...! Yuriko has to give personal details of her relationship history on a questionnaire, but she doesn't want Mr. Yoshizaki to find out she's a romance novice, so she lies through her teeth. He doesn't seem to believe her and insist on checking her height, weight, and even her sensitivity...
