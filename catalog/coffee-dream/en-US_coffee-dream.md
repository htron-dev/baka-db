## Sinopse

Japan is one of the world's leading consumers of coffee, but most Japaneses don't venture beyond a few tried and true patterns. An unsual coffee connoisseur- the heir to a traditional Japanese teahouse - offers unique insights into the world of coffee and novel ways to enjoy this old favorite.
