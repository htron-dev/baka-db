## Sinopse

Sawada Sawa is a super-positive high-school girl. On the way to confessing to Kawakami-senpai, whom she's attracted to, an incident happens! The moment she sees the bare face of her classmate, Nijouin-kun, her mind is filled with him ? even though she's supposed to like senpai! This is related to Nijouin-kun's secret... an incubus family lineage!?
