## Sinopse

Haru, a rookie manga artist, stops at a mysterious coffee shop one day. The shop, which opens only at night, was run by a vampire, and its regular customer is a wolfman! Haru begins visiting the coffee shop to listen to stories from the owner as a reference to his manga. Is he interested in him because of his stories, or because he likes him?!
