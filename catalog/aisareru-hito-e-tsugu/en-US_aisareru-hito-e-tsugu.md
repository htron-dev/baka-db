## Sinopse

It's while he was waiting for a girl in the street that Aikawa-san ran into a sweet-looking boy named Okakaneko Toshinori. The young man just got injured while saving a cat and he asked Aikawa-san to bring him to the hospital, leaving pretty much everything to the man's care. Three days later, Toshinori calls him and asks for his help again... (from B-U)
