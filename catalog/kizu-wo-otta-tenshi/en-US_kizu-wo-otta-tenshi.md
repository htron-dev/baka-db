## Sinopse

She let her guard down just one time, but once was all it took!

When Miranda, a nurse, is lured outside by a captivating sound, she finds an unfamiliar man playing the saxophone. Tempted by his sinfully soft voice, Miranda kisses him passionately. Then, suddenly, she's brought back to reality by the deep wounds in her heart and she flees. She decided long ago that she would never let herself be attracted to anyone again... Why did she let her guard down with him? Full of regret and bewilderment, she arrives at her new workplace and must confront a shocking situation. The man she kissed is her boss!
