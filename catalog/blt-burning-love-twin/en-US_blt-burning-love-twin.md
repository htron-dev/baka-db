## Sinopse

Twin brothers, Nozomu (going to a school for delinquents)and Saku (class president for a prestigious school), decide to switch places for the day. Humor and misunderstanding ensue as Saku can't control his urge to get everyone in tip-top shape, and Nozomu only has one plan - to find out why the Sensei keeps calling his brother. But while Nozomu is trying to find Sensei, Saku is learning what best friends are really for.
