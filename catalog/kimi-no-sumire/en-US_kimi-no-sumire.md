## Sinopse

Recently transferred to a new school, Sumire meets Toujou, a boy they all call, "The school's solitary Madonna." After stepping between a fight with Toujou and some others, he takes a liking to Sumire and they begin to spend their school days together. Although beautiful on the outside, Toujou is surprisingly brusque. Despite not making any effort to interact with others, he's surprisingly sweet to Sumire, which gets Sumire's heart thumping. One day, after Toujou's injured in a fight, he suddenly kisses Sumire...!
