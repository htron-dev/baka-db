    "sinopse": "A rather morbid, sombre story about two high school students—Kamiyama Itsuki and Morino Yoru—who have a peculiar interest in death; especially in murders that are committed close to them. Due to their strong fascination with murder and highly-developed analytical skills (along with some luck), they manage to solve the murders that have eluded even the authorities. Often, it is Kamiyama that solves the bulk of the crimes, down to the smallest of details. But there's only one thing he is interested in; by which method should Morino be killed.\n\n(Source: MU)",
