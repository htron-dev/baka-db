## Sinopse

At first glance, Arashi Mikami appears to be a normal, albeit socially awkward, 17-year-old high school student. He's actually part of a secret vigilante organization known as Black Label, a group dedicated to executing power-hungry criminals the law refuses to deal with; however, taking down a crime lord isn't always an easy task, and there are bound to be consequences for any action...

This is the action-packed story of the trials of Arashi and the people close to him.
