## Sinopse

Chris, a beautiful young man whom he met at a bar and Yuu, who had a drunken marriage with him. And the matching tattoo on his ring finger was also meant as a joke... "We're married, so we've gotta stay together." Persistent and possessive, he uncovers everything about Yuu's past. They happily drown in that drunken passion, but...!? A troubled tale of love that will move you to tears... has been drawn!
