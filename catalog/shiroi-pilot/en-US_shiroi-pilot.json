Dr. Posk of Migurusha Kingdom, who was killed by the secret police, has twin sons. After his death, one of the boys is found and looked after by the Queen, becoming \"Prince Marus,\" while his twin brother is sold to an underground factory as a slave. In the factory, he is raised as \"Ban Daisuke,\" a son of Ban Shunsaku. Daisuke, along with his father and seven fellow slaves, robs the factory of the jet plane \"Hurricane,\" and flees the factory. Then together, they fight the Kingdom to have all slaves set free. In the meantime, Daisuke and Marus come to know a secret they share, that one of them is a human clone made by the double-creating machine that Dr. Posk invented. Which is the clone, Daisuke or Marus? Despite their fear and agony, the two continue fighting.\n\n(Source: Tezuka Osamu Official)",
