## Sinopse

4. A Morning That Rarely Comes
   Newspaper delivery man Yuudai Ichikawa is up before the sun rises, and has always wondered about the one lit apartment he sees. But manga artist Chidzuru Sasaki is not what he's expecting. Still, the two become friends. As they find themselves growing closer, will this evolve into something more than friendship?
   (from M-U)
