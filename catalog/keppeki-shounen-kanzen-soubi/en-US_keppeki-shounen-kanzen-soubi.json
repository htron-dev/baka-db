A childhood experience at an amusement left him forever haunted and his future classmates forever weirded out. Seta is befriended by a classmate named Anna Aiuchi and they become close over the duration of a school trip. It isn't too last though when Aiuchi suddenly moves away overseas. While now one friend down, Seta soon enough finds himself surrounded by a group of sudden acquaintances including a persistent wannabe-girlfriend, shy-guy bunny lover and a hyperactive raincoat lover. Now he needs to learn to juggle helping friends with keeping himself emaculate in the process.\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Haken Gakusei",
