## Sinopse

The manga centers on a scary-faced high school student named Gou, who transfers to Hiroshima and tries to use the chance to change his image, but he fails and becomes a loner once again. But then, his classmate Isuzu forces him to join the "Kagura" club, which focuses on the kagura theatrical dance style of Shinto.
