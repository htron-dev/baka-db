Shinji, a high school student and second son of this particular family, finds himself the victim in this situation. What will happen now that he has to marry a boy, and that boy happens to be one of his classmates?\n\nCh. 5: Mr. Flower Groom (Hanamuko-san). Prequel to the manga Hanamuko-san.

While the succession is still in question, his 24-year-old bodyguard, Miyuki Sasaki, must protect him more vigilantly than ever before. But Akihiro is totally surprised when Miyuki enrolls as a transfer student in his class, to guard him as closely as possible. He even looks younger than him!\n\nCh. 7: If I Can See You Anytime...\nYoung and feminine-looking Natsuiro (a boy), is an employee at an \"image club\". The owner's son, Kousei, comes to visit every day, just to chat, since they have been friends forever.
