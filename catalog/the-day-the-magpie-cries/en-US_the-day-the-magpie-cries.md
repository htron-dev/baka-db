## Sinopse

Fed up with Westernization to the detriment of native culture, Lee Dan Ah wears a traditional Korean hanbok to her first day of high school rather than the required uniform. After being scolded by the liberal-minded principal for not following school regulations, she's given an ultimatum: If she can convince 70% of the student body and faculty to accept her idea within six months, the school will consider adopting a hanbok uniform. But that's going to be harder than it sounds when she can't even scrape together five members to start a hanbok club...
