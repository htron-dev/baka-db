## Sinopse

Max Hudson is a famous producer at Hudson Pictures, a studio known throughout Hollywood. Dana is the secretary of this proud but charming man, and she has been pining after him for five years. Max can't get over his dead wife, so in order to move on with her life, Dana decides to resign. But Max won't allow it. Not only that, he's now ordered her to stay in his house to help him with his work! Dana believes Max's reasons for not letting her go are purely professional. She has no inkling of the unseemly relationship he is drawing her into!
