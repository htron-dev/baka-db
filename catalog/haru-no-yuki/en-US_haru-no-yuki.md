## Sinopse

"I wanted to meet him," but it's impossible.

Hiyoshi, the doctor examining Yuuto, fell in love with Yukihiko at first sight. Immediately, he confessed and asked to go out with Yukihiko in the examination room. Despite being given cold treatment, Hiyoshi still hits on him every day. Yukihiko forgives him little by little because of Hiyoshi's kindness and warmth even though he blatantly rejected Hiyoshi before. Having lost someone precious and currently living through his life protecting Yuuto, Yukihiko's couldn't be honest with his own feelings...

It's a romantic, touching, and warming love story.
