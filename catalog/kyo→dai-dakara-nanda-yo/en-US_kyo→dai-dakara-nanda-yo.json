My teacher confessed to me and we started dating but I inadvertently lost my virginity! That's because, everyone around me already experienced their first time and I thought it was too late for me. At that time, my sister who has always lived separately from me returned. We met for many days and she wanted to have a romp in the hay with me!?\n\n(Source: Awakened Memories and Covenant of Darkness)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Shimobe no Oshigoto.\nVolume 2: Renai Saishuu Chiten (Love's Final Place)",
