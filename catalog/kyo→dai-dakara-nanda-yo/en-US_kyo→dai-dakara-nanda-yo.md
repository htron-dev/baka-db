## Sinopse

My private tutor and boyfriend, Midorikawa-sensei is a student attending a super elite medical school. My teacher confessed to me and we started dating but I inadvertently lost my virginity! That's because, everyone around me already experienced their first time and I thought it was too late for me. At that time, my sister who has always lived separately from me returned. We met for many days and she wanted to have a romp in the hay with me!?
