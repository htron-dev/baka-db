    "sinopse": "\"Minna Ai no Seine\" deals with the lives of the Nakamu family. This men-only family revolves around Masato, the youngest of the lot and the most naive and innocent one. He's a gentle and physically weak kid who's constantly the center of attraction for his brothers and father (who looks like one of the brothers...). \"Minna\" is essentially a collection of stories about this unique family - school, family, life in general - and is the kind that leave you with a warm feeling inside you (from baka-updates manga)",
