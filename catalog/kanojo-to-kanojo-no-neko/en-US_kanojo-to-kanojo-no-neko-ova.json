    "sinopse": "It was on a rainy spring day that Chobi became a young woman's pet cat. Though he immediately fell in love with the beautiful and kind person who took him in, he can never hope to fully understand the complex world of humans. Over the course of their first year living in the same apartment, Chobi and his new owner live in their own separate worlds⁠—standing alone yet close together.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
