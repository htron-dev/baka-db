## Sinopse

Mako is a shy girl who is easily embarrassed, and Hachisuka is a cool, expressionless boy. The two are friends at the same school, but they're not just ordinary students: Mako is a cyclops, and Hachisuka is a cat-eared boy. The story follows their daily life and events surrounding them, as well as Mako's awkward attempt to express her feelings for Hachisuka.
