## Sinopse

Touno Hifumi learned various martial arts and disciplines from childhood. One day, he was forced to practice them in another world. Hifumi, who was suppressing his desire to kill people in modern Japan, decided to go live in a different world. A human being forged by martial arts to his very limits, with a distorted sense of ethics, and kills people without a second thought, has been called to a different world.
