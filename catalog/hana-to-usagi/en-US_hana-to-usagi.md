## Sinopse

Aizawa-san in room 411 is always wearing a rabbit... The delivery's good customer Soubou-san is a shy rabbit-man with a withdrawal syndrome. Why is he wearing something like that in the first place? Pervert? Everyday he does delivery but you can't see his face and he's mute, there's nothing scarier than this.

But one day, still wearing the rabbit-head, he grabbed tightly onto my arm, "T-thank you, I'll see you again tomorrow..." Saying it in such an embarrassed way—My heart beats so fast.
