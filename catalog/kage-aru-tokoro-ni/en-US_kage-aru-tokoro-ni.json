    "sinopse": "Pediatric surgeon Nakamichi grapples with grief when his older lover, hospital director Tsutsumi, is critically ill following a stroke. His problems are compounded when the younger Tsutsumi, the director's son, begins working with him as a new intern. Tsutsumi junior dislikes Nakamichi on sight, and he soon reveals why: he knows all about his father's illicit affair with Nakamichi. (Source: Half-Baked Scans)",
