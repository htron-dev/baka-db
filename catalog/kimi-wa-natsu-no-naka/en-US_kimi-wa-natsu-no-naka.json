    "sinopse": "Despite their differing popularity, high school students Chiharu Saeki and Wataru Toda are close friends. Saeki is the most handsome guy in their grade who constantly rejects girls that confess to him, claiming that he already likes someone. Bonding over their common hobby of watching movies, Saeki and Wataru go to the movie theater a couple of times a month, alternating between the movies they want to see.\n\nOne day, after watching a movie, Saeki confesses to Wataru but tells him that he does not have to accept or return his feelings. In exchange, Saeki requests that they go on a journey over the summer to tour the filming locations of various movies. Though Wataru tries to maintain a nonchalant disposition after the confession, he begins to question how he really feels about Saeki as they start to spend more time together through their small promise.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
