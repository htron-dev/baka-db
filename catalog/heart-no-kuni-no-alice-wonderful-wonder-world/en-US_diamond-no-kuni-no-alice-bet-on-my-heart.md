## Sinopse

An illustrated novel that introduces the all-new Country of Diamonds! Alice suddenly shifts territories from the Country of Clover to the all-new Country of Diamonds, and everything has changed. None of the familiar faces in the Country of Diamonds seem to remember Alice—in fact, they claim to have never met her before!

Join Alice as she makes new friends and enemies, and becomes embroiled in new romances, all while exploring the exciting new regions in the Country of Diamond: Castle Diamond, the Graveyard, the Train Station, and Hatter Mansion.
