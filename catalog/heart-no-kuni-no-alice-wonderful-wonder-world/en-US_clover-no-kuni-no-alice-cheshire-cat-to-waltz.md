## Sinopse

Alice has a new suitor—this time he's pink and furry, otherwise known as Boris, the Cheshire Cat. After being transported to the mysterious Country of Clover, Alice is relieved to discover that her friend Boris has come along. But she can't enjoy a moment's respite, as the Cheshire Cat keeps hitting on her. Should she give in to such a self-indulgent cat? While Alice wavers, their relationship is sure to evolve—for better or worse is anyone's guess. Sweet, yet dangerous. Love is risky business in Wonderland.
