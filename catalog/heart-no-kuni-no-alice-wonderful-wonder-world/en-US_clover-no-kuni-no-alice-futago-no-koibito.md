## Sinopse

Clover no Kuni no Alice: Futago no Koibito chronicles the further adventures of Alice as she goes deeper down the rabbit hole.

Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are the "Bloody Twins," amorous and affable killers who are able to transform themselves into adorable children or suavely handsome adults. As the gatekeepers to the Hatter Mansion, they tried to kill Alice once. Now they are hopelessly in love with her. In this newest adventure, will either Dee or Dum win Alice's affections, and more importantly...will she survive their screwball courtship?
