## Sinopse

Julius Monrey is the grim Clockmaker of Wonderland, responsible for controlling the world's time from his lonely Clock Tower, not to mention fixing the stopped clocks of the dead. When the beautiful Alice Liddell comes to live with and rely upon him, will her warm personality melt through his cool, apathetic heart, and bring about romantic feelings he never knew he had?
