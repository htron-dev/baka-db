The punks on the dMp are the weirdest, nastiest, most outlandishly powerful musclebound freaks the galaxy has ever known. Kid Muscle's only hope: form a team that's even wilder. The only possible result is earthshaking, bodyslamming, ultimate-powered action that sends our entire planet sailing over the top rope!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
