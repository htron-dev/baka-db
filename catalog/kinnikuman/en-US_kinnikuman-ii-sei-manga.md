## Sinopse

Kid Muscle, the son of legendary wrestler King Muscle, rockets to Earth and finds an evil wrestling gang called the dMp tearing the place apart. The punks on the dMp are the weirdest, nastiest, most outlandishly powerful musclebound freaks the galaxy has ever known. Kid Muscle's only hope: form a team that's even wilder. The only possible result is earthshaking, bodyslamming, ultimate-powered action that sends our entire planet sailing over the top rope!
