    "sinopse": "After the terrible battle against the Demon Seeds peace has been restored and thus Mantarou is wasting his time away sleeping around, like usual... Suddenly he has a weird dream of him fighting a tag match against the Original 'Machine guns' team (Kinnikuman x Terryman tag team)... Even weirder is that the machine guns aren't 60 something, but are instead in their top form at their finest age, as they where when they won the universal tag team championship... Could this weird new vs old dream mean something?\n\nAs he awakes from his afternoon nap, Mantarou realizes that there are some evil beings floating around the sky that call themselves Time Choujins, after sending a weird challenge they just banish in thin air without leaving a trace.\n\n(Source: MU)",
