## Sinopse

An evening party calls for its attendees to be dressed to perfection. Thus, they are ideal places for Aurora el la Porta, the daughter of an earl, to admire the fine embroidery of the ladies' dresses. Content to stand in the background, she is surely not expecting to be smacked in the head by a ring, let alone be proposed to by Felix el le Clavis, the most eligible bachelor in the kingdom!

For the past year, Felix has been besieged by marriage interviews, an amount totaling in the three digits. In a desperate attempt to escape the onslaught of suitors, he declares, "whoever this ring hits shall be my wife." With a fling, the ring sails through the air and smacks Aurora on the forehead.

Choosing to go along with this fake engagement, Aurora hopes to have more time to embroider, and Felix finally has a respite from the countless women seeking his hand. Although it seems to be a fortuitous twist of fate, was it all a coincidence to be the fiancée chosen by the ring?
