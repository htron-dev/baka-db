## Sinopse

When Morvenna woke up, she was on an unfamiliar beach and surrounded by armed men. She had been searching for her father, an explorer who had gone missing, which is how she'd come to be found there. She'd been relying on the single map that he had left behind... The man who stretched out his hand to save her was a young man named Roque de Bras Ferro. He'd come to see the yacht that had sunk off the shores of this Brazilian island, and he'd treated her leg injury, too. He spoke to her in fluent English and his blue eyes seemed to pull her in as he spoke.
