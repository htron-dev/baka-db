## Sinopse

Murasaki Ichijou is a girl with dreams of entering the world of interpretative dance—but she knows she hasn't got the charisma, the fitness, or the commitment to do it. Watching on the sidelines, she eyes her classmate, the naturally brilliant Sora Sumire with envy... until a chance encounter with dancing prodigy (and absolute complete weirdo) Shounosuke makes her finally get the resolve needed to dance out her dreams! Fueled by grudges, anger, and pure energy, Murasaki will dance!
