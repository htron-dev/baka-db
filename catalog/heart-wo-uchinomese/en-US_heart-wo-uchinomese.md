## Sinopse

No matter how many times she sleeps with Arai, Negishi realizes that neither her nor Arai's feelings were being conveyed. Their sex felt "like" love, but only feeling "like" something wasn’t the same thing as having it. What is Negishi supposed to do in order to get Arai to understand her true feelings?
