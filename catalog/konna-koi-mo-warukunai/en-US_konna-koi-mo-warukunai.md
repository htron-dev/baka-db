## Sinopse

Junichi, a freelance web designer, and Harumi, a salaryman are live-in lovers. However, living together is not what it's all cracked up to be. They constantly bicker over trivial things. And it seems that the only way they could settle anything is through sex! But is that really enough to keep a relationship going?
(from Fantasy Shrine)
