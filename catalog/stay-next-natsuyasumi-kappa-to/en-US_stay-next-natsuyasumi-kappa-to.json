    "sinopse": "Inoue is an amateur photographer who delights and profits from taking slightly voyeuristic pictures. He stumbles upon a beautiful girl wielding a naginata and immediately takes a picture. She demands the roll of film, but Inoue pockets it before she can get to it. Inoue promptly begins to stalk her and declares his love.\n\n(Source: MU)",
