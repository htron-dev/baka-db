## Sinopse

When Kanade was very young, she went to a ballet performance of her neighbour, Lisa, and was overwhelmed by her amazing dancing. She decided then and there that she wanted to dance like Lisa, and her parents agreed to let her take ballet lessons. Ballet is much harder than Lisa's beautiful dancing may have led her to believe, but Kanade is determined to endure and become a wonderful ballerina!
