## Sinopse

Manase Yuuji, a university student who is rather popular with girls without his knowledge, taciturn and withdrawn type. In fact, he hides a secret wound that will be revealed during the visit of his sister hairdresser-stylist: he does not feel at ease in this body of a man that he's in.
