    "sinopse": "In the year 20XX, humans face an unprecedented crisis in their history when extraterrestrial dragons decided to select Earth as their breeding ground. Unfortunately, where the dragon eggs hatch, they absorb all the nutrients from the surrounding land, turning it into a barren wasteland. That's what happened to Tokyo two years ago, where our hero Kamishina Jin, lost his loved ones. Now, he's joined the Dragonaut units, with Toa, a mysterious girl who saved him, to stop the dragons from destroying the rest of Earth.",
