    "sinopse": "It is about a boy named Techno who lived in a bomb shelter most of his life. He and his grandfather are amazingly smart. But one day Techno sees a girl named Hitomi on his yard. He instantly falls in love. He names her Daisy, even though she keeps telling him that's not her name. After 3 months of practice on a robot he decides to get a relationship started with her. But all he can do is stare. Then he decides to get full ownership of her, but she still doesn't really belong to Techno. Along their way on this crazy relationship, Techno's genius almost kills Hitomi multiple times. That includes making her 50 feet tall, making a replacement teacher that shoots laser beams, creating a giant slug, kidnapping her, and much more. More crazy things include a teacher that wears weird costumes, a harmless boy rebel that is wanted dead by Techno, his mom, and brother, Techno's over protective grandfather, Hitomi's friends, an android that wants Techno dead and to protect Hitomi, the 2 missiles that Techno befriended, and the rest of the class.",
