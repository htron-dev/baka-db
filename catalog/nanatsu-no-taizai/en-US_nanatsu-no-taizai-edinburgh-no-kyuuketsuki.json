    "sinopse": "Edinburgh, Liones' neighbor, is a powerful kingdom protected by the strength of the Holy Knights. But when the seal keeping the Vampire Clan from running rampant is broken, Edinburgh falls to ruin in a single night, as the vampires begin feeding on the inhabitants of its once proud capital and add many to their ranks.\n\nWhen the vampires announce their existence by sending one of their own to Liones in the guise of a messenger, the Great Holy Knights Zaratras, Dreyfus, and Hendricksen request the aid of the Seven Deadly Sins in order to find a way to reclaim Edinburgh from the clutches of their nocturnal foes.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
