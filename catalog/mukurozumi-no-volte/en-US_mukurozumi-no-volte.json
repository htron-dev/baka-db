    "sinopse": "These are interesting times in the empire of Varnia. The imperial army may have broken the back of the invading army of Nebel, but at tremendous cost. The living weapons born of past wars with the magic-wielding tribes of the south still prowl the ancient forests. And ever since the battle in the northern pass, an avenging phantom has stalked the trails of Varnia, leaving carnage in its wake: The immortal warrior, the last knight of Orgonne... And they call her Slayer Volte.\n\n(Source: MU)",
