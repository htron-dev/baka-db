## Sinopse

A smart, athletic, who handles anything perfectly and unequaled beautiful girl, dies young due to a car accident. And now, while possessing the memories of her previous life, is reincarnated in a fantasy-ish world with swords and magic!

In this world all lives were dependent on magicians, however, their numbers decreased every year due to the magic power scattered around the world running out, thus the reliance on magic was coming to an end.

This is a story that will lead to the life of a girl relying on the knowledge of her previous life, as she proposes a way to live even without the use of magic while seeking for what it is, and aiming for a wealthier life.
