## Sinopse

In a mountain range where even the tears are freezing, a woman nicknamed Yukikamakiri is rising up. May this wedding receive an eternal blessing.

The War of Frozen Blood raged on for decades between two main tribes of this region, the Mirde, a clan believing in eternal life after death, and the Ferbie, a clan where even the women are ferocious warriors, and are said to be so violent in love that they "eat" the man they passionately love. As such, those women were nicknamed the "Yukikamakiri," the snow praying mantises.

In order for the war to finally end, a promise was made : That the new young leaders of the respective clans are to be united under a political marriage of convenience. That promise was taken by the now deceased former leader of each clan. Ten years have passed since that promise was made. Can the peace really be achieve with this marriage with no love involved, a marriage going against the very nature of the snow praying mantises' violent and passionate love, and can the long hatred forgotten that easily?
