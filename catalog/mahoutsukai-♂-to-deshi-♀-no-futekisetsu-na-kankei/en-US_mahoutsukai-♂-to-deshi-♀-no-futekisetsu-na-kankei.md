Hard working, level 1 magician Konoha is apprenticed to lazy Knight Protector Saionji Ikumaru. They both work to keep the ether world sealed away from their own but sometimes the seal doesn't work. Dragons, demons and now Ishtar, the goddess of Venus. Will Ishtar help Konoha win her master's affections? Or will she take him for herself?
