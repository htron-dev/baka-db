## Sinopse

A collection of 4 short stories:

1. Youth Survival (Seishun Love Letter)
   Summer camping trips are supposed to be filled with joy and laughter, but why is Kiriko so unlucky? At first, it was that weakling four eyes, Kazuo and cutesy Hana-chan destroying the pork soup, but when they never returned after a trip to pick wild herbs, Kiriko and Satoru are sent to search for them in the mountains. Little did they know that they would get lost too! (Source: Ochibichan) -- published in Betsucomi

2. Liar Love Letters (Usotsuki Love Letter)
   When Ritsu's boyfriend asks to break up, she readily complies, but finds out later that he's upset she didn't beg him to reconsider. To make her pay for dumping him so easily, he puts on a bet among his friends. Trick Ritsu into falling in love, and win 30,000 yen. When she overhears this, Ritsu is determined to shoot down all the boys out to trick her. But what happens when she comes across someone whose lies actually just might capture her heart?
