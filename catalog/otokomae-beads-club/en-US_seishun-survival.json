    "sinopse": "A collection of 4 short stories:\n\n1. Youth Survival (Seishun Love Letter)\n   Summer camping trips are supposed to be filled with joy and laughter, but why is Kiriko so unlucky? At first, it was that weakling four eyes, Kazuo and cutesy Hana-chan destroying the pork soup, but when they never returned after a trip to pick wild herbs, Kiriko and Satoru are sent to search for them in the mountains. Little did they know that they would get lost too! (Source: Ochibichan) -- published in Betsucomi\n\n2. Liar Love Letters (Usotsuki Love Letter)\n   When Ritsu's boyfriend asks to break up, she readily complies, but finds out later that he's upset she didn't beg him to reconsider. To make her pay for dumping him so easily, he puts on a bet among his friends. Trick Ritsu into falling in love, and win 30,000 yen. When she overhears this, Ritsu is determined to shoot down all the boys out to trick her. But what happens when she comes across someone whose lies actually just might capture her heart? (Source: Ochibichan) -- published in Betsucomi\n\n3. Sword and Heart Dangerous Relationship (Yaiba to Heart no Kiken na Kankei)\n   17 year-old Ohgami Shizuru is a normal high school student...except for the fact that she comes from a family of ninjas! Most of the time, she only has use for her skills when she is late for school and needs to (sneakily) enter her classroom, but Yamada Kousaku from the Ninja Association informs her that he's been sent by her father to help protect an important scroll in her house that holds the secret to becoming the most powerful ninja ever. Who are the enemies targeting her and what do they have to do with her first love Kotarou? -- published in Betsucomi DX\n\n4. Never Dying Crow…! (Otokomae! Beads Club - Fushichou no You ni...!)\n   A side story of the series \"Otokomae! Beads Club\" by the same author. Oikawa, Takumi, and the familiar crazy characters of the high school beads club are at it again. This time, they are out to save a girl named Kurahashi-san, who has become a recent target of bullying b/c a popular teacher, Yamaoka-sensei, has been paying attention to her more as of late. -- published in Betsucomi DX",
