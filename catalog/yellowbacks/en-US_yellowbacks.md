## Sinopse

Very clever, very subtle - even when her words are very direct, Kan Takahama tackles subjects as diverse as suicide pacts, mermaids, making a porno film and bar room chat with a robust yet delicate grace.

Probably the most talented mangaka to have recently emerged from Japan, Kan Takahama's art and story telling will surprise when least expected...
