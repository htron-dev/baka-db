## Sinopse

Who's the most popular of all the Tenchi girls? That's an easy question to answer. It's sweet li'l Sasami, of course! She's the cutest and best loved and, without a doubt, the most accomplished cook of the bunch. Whether she's thwarting evil space invaders or simply negotiating peace among her bickering housemates, Sasami always has a big smile on her face.
