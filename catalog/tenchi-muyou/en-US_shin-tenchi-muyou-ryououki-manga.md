Tenchi Masaki is a shy high school boy, yet honest and hard working. He looks forward to living a basic humble life, taking over his grandfather's shrine. However, nothing is ever as simple as one would want, as Tenchi soon learns. A series of events beginning with the sudden appearance of Ryoko, the space pirate, creates madness in his home. Now he must figure out how to juggle 2 princess's, a space pirate, 2 galaxy police, the worlds most intelligent genius and a Rabbit-turned-Spaceship in his quiet country home.
