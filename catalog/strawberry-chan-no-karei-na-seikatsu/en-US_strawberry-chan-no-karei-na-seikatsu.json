Strawberry-chan loved his boy, Akiyoshi very much, but Akiyoshi iked nothing more than to use a straw to blow Strawberry-chan up like a balloon, much to the frogs chagrin.\n\nAkiyoshi's friends all feel very differently about Strawberry-chan. Some of them wish he were treated better, some really love him and one even wishes that he was Strawberry-chan.\n\nWith all this love and abuse, will our frog possibly survive the first volume?\n\n(Source: Media Blasters)",
