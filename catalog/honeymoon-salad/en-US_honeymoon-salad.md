## Sinopse

His ex-workers keep calling for help; his memory of his first love is traumatic to say the least, he hates his father so much that he'll never go back home, a stranger blames him for pushing her down the stairs... no wonder being pissed is a daily routine for Natsukawa Minori. Then enters one, no two women in his life that will make him too busy to be pissed.
