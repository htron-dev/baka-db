    "sinopse": "Golems: living dolls crafted by adept molders of earth and magic. Farmers use them to perform menial labor, law enforcement use them to bolster security, and aristocrats use them as their closest companions. Just like any tool, however, golems can be used for good or evil.\n\nClay, an aspiring young molder who travels to the city to take part in a golem-building contest-the winner of which will become the guardian of the city's treasury! When dark forces learn of Clay's unique skills, he becomes a target worth more than the city's coffers. Luckily, Clay has three golem friends who will do anything in their power to protect him. Join fledgling golem-maker Clay and his eccentric companions as he embarks on a journey of grand adventure!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
