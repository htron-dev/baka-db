## Sinopse

The dedicated student council secretary is being hit on by a half-Japanese underclassman. Iyogi is too kind for his own good to refuse helping others. Even today, he ended up looking after a new transfer student tasked by the student council president, Akira. Enzou, the said transfer student, was raised in France: foreign-like features and gestures, stylish appearance—he's really attractive. For the xenophobic Iyogi, however, it was the worst thing that could happen. Not to mention that love helplessly blossomed for Enzou...?!
