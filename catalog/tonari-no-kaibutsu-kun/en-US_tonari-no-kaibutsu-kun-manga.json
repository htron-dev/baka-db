    "sinopse": "Shizuku Mizutani is a so-called \"study bug\" who cares little about her classmates and instead strives to become a successful working person like her mother. However, her world changes when she is bribed into bringing notes to the class delinquent, Yoshida Haru, who had quit school after a violent fight got him suspended.\n\nDespite his abrasive introduction, Haru soon becomes convinced that they are friends, even going as far as confessing his love for her. As she spends more time with Haru, Shizuku learns that beneath his rough exterior he has a kind and honest spirit.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
