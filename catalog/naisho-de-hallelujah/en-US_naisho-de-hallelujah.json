Shuuichiro tells him no, but Botan brings one home anyway...a very human-looking cat who is actually a man who Shuuichiro slept with before named Umekichi! Will Umekichi get to stay? Will Shuuichirou figure out what Umekichi reminds him of his past? And will he sleep with him again even though he's Botan's pet?",
