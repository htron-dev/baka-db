## Sinopse

Keiji's hometown is a bit weird, and among the strange customs is the funeral each person has for themselves when they turn 33. He's come back for the "funeral" of his former best friend Hakuga, but being back is bringing back memories of his relationship with Hakuga, and the feelings he never thought he'd have to deal with again.
