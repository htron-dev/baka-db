## Sinopse

Miharu is smart, attractive and talented. One could say he's been playing life in "easy mode." That is until a teddy bear steals his wallet and a strange man comes out of an arcade game and demands Miharu play a game; the D-game! What's worse, the man even claims to be from the future. What will happen when Miharu must play to survive?
