## Sinopse

The planet of Salami is almost identical to planet Earth. Judging from the appearance, there's nothing different from Earth... Except... The sense of beauty is VERY different. Aimi is an orphan living with her step-mother and step-sisters, and she is what we consider as being beautiful, but what THEY consider as ugly. Yet, that doesn't end the story. Just by an accident, Aimi stumbles upon Earth and meets Kyou Naruse, a self-centered person or someone called.... "The Narcissist." Our very own Cinderella Story... [except for the fact that Aimi's sense of beauty is ALSO different] or not.
