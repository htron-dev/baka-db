## Sinopse

A quirky yuri comedy about the chaotic daily life of high school girls!

Yokoe and Sugiura have been together forever, and they've mastered the art of making trouble when life's a bore. High school might be a drag, but these girls in love know just how to inject a little chaos and comedy into their sloppy school life.
