The final moments of the Edo Period approach! The American fleet known as "The Black Ships," with Admiral Matthew Perry at the helm, demand the end of the shogunate's isolationist policy and the opening of Japan to western trade. In a last attempt to stop the war, Abe Masahiro, the chief councilor to the shogun, tasks his men with finding Sawamura Jinzaburou, one of the last shinobi in the land.
