## Sinopse

Catsby, twenty-something nobody, loses his girl-friend to another man. A richer man. His pal Houndu treats him to wine, women and song, but there's no forgetting the lost Persu. The thousand humiliations of youth are poured upon Catsby, who feels far too much to begin with, and whose prospects go from bad to worse. Now he's petrified by his father, now drunk on the floor, now freaking over a blind-date, now convinced it's all for nothing. And that's just volume one of this groundbreaking new series.
No detail however vulgar or delicate is left out as the angst of youth is beautifully dissected.
