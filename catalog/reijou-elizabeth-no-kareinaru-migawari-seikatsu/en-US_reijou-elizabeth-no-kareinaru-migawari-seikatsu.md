## Sinopse

"Elizabeth!" as someone called out to her, she turned around just to see a fine nobleman in front of her.

Elizabeth, a noble lady from the countryside was suddenly grabbed by the arm and abducted. According to Sylvester, the heir to a Duke household and her so-called "kidnapper," she looks exactly like his younger sister to the point they even shared the same name "Elizabeth," the duke's daughter who went missing after eloping. In exchange for lending her penurious family a help, the vicious lady Elizabeth who takes every opportunity to her gain, begins her... splendid life as a replacement...?
