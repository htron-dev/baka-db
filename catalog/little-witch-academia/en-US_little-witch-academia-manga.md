## Sinopse

When Atsuko "Akko" Kagari was a little girl, she attended the Magical Festa magic show hosted by the witch Shiny Chariot. Ever since then, she has dreamed of also becoming a witch by enrolling at Luna Nova, the academy her idol attended. Akko befriends two fellow witches—Lotte Yansson and Sucy Manbavaran—who she believes will share in her fantastical, magical school experience... However, although Luna Nova Academy is filled to the brim with magic and witches, it is not quite what she expected.

Seen as an inept, rebellious, and talentless witch, Akko struggles daily to prove she is worthy of her place at the academy. One day, an opportunity to demonstrate her merit presents itself—she must defeat an ancient dragon thought to be previously sealed. Can Akko emerge as the successful witch she desperately yearns to be?
