## Sinopse

Sumika Murasame is not a cute girl. Nicknamed "Violence Murasame" by her peers, the tall and imposing Sumika shows little signs of femininity. And unfortunately for Sumika, her best friend and crush, Ushio Kazama, only likes cute girls. Ushio loves to gush about her endless crushes, completely oblivious to Sumika's feelings.

During their first year of high school, Sumika and Ushio encounter Tomoe Hachisuka and Miyako Tamae, two other girls of a similar orientation. Desiring to start a club for "girl-loving girls," the group attempts to find a fifth member and get their club approved. Though Sumika has some reservations about the purpose of the club, she recognizes this as an opportunity to get closer to Ushio and resolve her unrequited love.
