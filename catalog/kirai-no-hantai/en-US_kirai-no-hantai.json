    "sinopse": "Among this group of 5 childhood friends, Aki and Jin always quarrel when seeing each other. Aki is a serious, rigid post office employee, while Jin is the son of a distinguished family, and a frivolous lad at first glance. Both take a liking to the bright, cute, and a little bit silly Hina. That's why whenever one goes to play with Hina, the other is always there! That's creepy! One may think that's a love triangle, but one day Aki and Jin ended up together, just the two of them in an awkward atmosphere. They hate each other, and yet their hearts were palpitating... At last, they kissed...?!\n\n(Kaiohsha, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Micchaku Mode",
