## Sinopse

Lusters, those who have the ability to embody their heart's true wishes into a power. Because people were afraid of the possibility of the Lusters committing crimes, it was decided that death row inmates, Gundogs, were to subdue the Lusters.

What will satisfy their hunger?

Now, standing in the jaws of death of desire!!
