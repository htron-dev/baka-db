## Sinopse

On the first day of high school, because of a conditioned response, Kunie Hokuto injured Yachigusa Shissa, the disciplinary committee chairman feared by students throughout the school. He listens to Shissa's remarks and agrees to be appointed to stay with him as his servant, in compensation for the injury. In addition, without knowing why, he is designated as a first-year representative to the disciplinary committee, but the disciplinary committee vice chairman, Shissa's younger brother, Zento, declares, "I do not approve"...!?
