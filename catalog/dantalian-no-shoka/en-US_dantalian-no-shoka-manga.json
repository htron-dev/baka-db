    "sinopse": "The young man Huey took over the old mansion of his deceased bibliomanic grand father as well as the book collection that's stored in there. But there was a condition: he also had to inherit the \"Bibliotheca.\"\n\nWhen he inspects the mansion, Huey discovers a cellar filled with piled up books. In the midst of them he comes across a black-dressed girl who's silently reading a book. She's called Darian and has a big lock hanging in front of her. She herself is the entrance to the \"Bibliotheca of Dantalian\" which contains the prohibited \"Phantom Books.\"\n\n(Source: MyPersonal-scan-)",
