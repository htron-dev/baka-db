## Sinopse

Suddenly summoned to another world, former office lady Mahiru Fukuyose becomes a lunchlady in order to cover her living expenses, as well as gather information. Then one day, she gets her hopes up when she hears a rumor that the genius Magician Randy may hold a hint to help return her to her original world.

"To find the practitioner than summoned you here, we must uncover the motives behind it."

Things become messy after it's determined Mahiru holds a great amount of magical power, and must therefore cohabitate with Randy?! And on top of that, he finds eating to be too troublesome, making him the ultimate picky eater!
