## Sinopse

Amushasu, of the Alaturca Alagun performing troupe, believes in magic created by talent and hard work to reach the hearts of his audience. He does not have any respect for the magic of genies, though he does happen to own a very dissatisfied one named Mayu. His faith in his ability to sway a crowd is threatened, however, when he comes across a beautiful young lady whose heart appears to be untouchable.
