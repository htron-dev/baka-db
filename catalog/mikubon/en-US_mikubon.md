Hatsune Miku and her friends Rin, Len, and Luka are not only back in manga... they're back to school, enrolling at the St. Diva Academy for Vocaloids! They're going to give it their best at St. Diva, as a wonderland of friendship, determination, and even love unfolds! But can they stay out of trouble, especially when the mad professor of the Hachune Miku Research Lab is nearby?
