## Sinopse

When she was young, Shiraishi Masago had a special ability to sense people's feelings and thoughts, but she grew out of it once she moved in with her new family after the tragic death of her own parents. Or so she thought... While at school one day, she senses a murderous intent so strong that she faints. Scared, she tells her friends Shinohara Kei and Hidaka Satoru, who both tell her not to worry. But when a club member turns up dead at their school festival, she's convinced that what she felt was not a coincidence. Who is the killer and what does Masago have to do with the murder?

Note: Included in vol. 2 is a one-shot by Matsumoto Yoko-sensei titled "Chi no Tsubuyaki, Yami no Sasayaki" about an obsessed guy who comes back as a ghost to haunt the girl he loves.
