## Sinopse

When Yuuta Kiryuu accidentally kills his girlfriend during a beating, he runs away from the scene and winds up reluctantly falling in with a group of repulsive criminals. From abusers like himself to serial murderers, rapists, cannibals, and more, his twisted world only gets stranger the deeper he goes.
