## Sinopse

Coming back after noticing that he had forgotten to lock his front door, Senka found a beastman with face like a wolf in his house! Even though the beastman suddenly attacked and licked his whole body with ragged breath, Senka couldn't help himself from feeling good...?! This is a strange cohabitation story of the beastman named Dietrich and the slutty novelist Senka.
