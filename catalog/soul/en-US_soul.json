    "sinopse": "Taepung is born of a rather prestigious family. But he is practically neglected by his father. And while he is purposely being beaten up by a gang, he decides that being beaten up is not much better than living. And then a ghostly girl with a strange voice rescues him. But the girl steals his precious necklace just like that—and when he finds her again, she is a fortune-teller girl who seems to be possessed. What will happen between these two?\n\n(Source: Acacia15)",
