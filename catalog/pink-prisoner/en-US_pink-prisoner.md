Hazuki Mayu is the granddaughter of Hazuki Ichinosuke, founder of the Hazuki-style Sword Arts. Four years ago, she debuted as a child star in a children-oriented TV program, but Mayu had a bad experience as a direct result of that and has steered clear of the world of entertainment ever since. But then she receives a request from movie director Iwasawa to coordinate a sword fight scene!?
