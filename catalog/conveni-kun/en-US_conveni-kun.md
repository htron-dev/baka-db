## Sinopse

To break away from his existence as a NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) and staying at home all day, Endou Hiroshi starts work at a convenience store. There he meets an arrogant and rude co-worker, Yamai Kouhei, whom he just can't get along with. However, after seeing a different side of Yamai and getting to know him more, Endou's impression of him starts to change for the better. But, just as things seem to be going fine for Endou and his return to society, his past comes back to trouble him.
