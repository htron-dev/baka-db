## Sinopse

Omi Sorasaki is a just a normal high school boy. One day, a mysterious girl transferred to his school. She said to him, "I want to talk to you alone after school." Omi is nervous because he can't believe his mediocre life is about to change with a girl's love confession. Wait, is it a confession?
