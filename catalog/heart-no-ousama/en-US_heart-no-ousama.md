## Sinopse

The king of hearts is the king that captures all girls' hearts.

Yui, a teacher at a cram school, is a girl who always helps anyone in trouble. After seeing her neighbor, Sakimoto, collapse on the street, it was only natural for her to nurse him back to health. But when she did, she started to be interested in this somewhat mean guy...?!
