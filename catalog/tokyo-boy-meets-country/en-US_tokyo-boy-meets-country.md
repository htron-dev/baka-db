## Sinopse

City boy, Chiaki, was asked to take on a "Big Project" by his grandfather and sent to Tokachi, Hokkaido. However, upon his arrival to the project site, Chiaki is met with farming land full of cattle... the countryside?!

In order to help the spoiled Chiaki mature, his grandfather tells him to "earn enough money to pay for your flight home."

In front of a hopeless Chiaki, appears the extremely tall, Soichirou, who was under the impression that he was going to be living with a girl who would be undergoing bridal training…?!
