## Sinopse

Licca Belmonte is a spirited girl who couldn't be any happier, but her life becomes even more joyous when she gains an adoptive brother, Geralt, whom her parents found starving on the street. Licca welcomes him with open arms—but then, a status screen opens in front of her! This triggers a faint recollection of Licca's past life: one of a modern-day Japanese girl.

With a general idea of what she is seeing, she understands that the status screen displays a favorability rating—that is, how close a person is to her. The problem is that Geralt's rating is negative 30! Licca does whatever she can to become closer to her new brother, but no matter what happens or how close they seem to be in the moment, his rating never exceeds zero. Just why does he seem to hate her so much?
