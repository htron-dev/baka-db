## Sinopse

Chapter 1:
Body Check - A Uniform Story oneshot: Inoue's close friend, Yano, is a sincere, reliable and popular guy. He even gets love letters from underclassmen though it's an all-boy's school. "Just one letter like that can make you respond?... Eventhough it's from someone who's never tried to talk to you before." Is this feeling of jealousy just the possessiveness of a close friend or is it...
