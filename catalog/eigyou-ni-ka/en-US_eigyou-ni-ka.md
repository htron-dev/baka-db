## Sinopse

Happiness does not exist for gay men who fall for straight men.
I'm happy just being by his side—was what I was thinking up until…

Sakisaka, stationed in the second Sales Division, has an unrequited love for Toujou, his directing senpai. He had no intention of confessing his feelings. However, Toujou has been awfully touchy-feely lately…

Which path will these vexing feelings flow down to?
