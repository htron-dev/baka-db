    "sinopse": "Mimiko Hanayashiki lives in a countryside mansion on a hill with her adoptive father Akane. She wants for nothing, and her life is wonderful, but since Akane is so handsome and kind, she starts to develop romantic feelings toward him. Knowing that he could never see her as anything other than his adorable daughter, she keeps these emotions to herself. However, one night, she is met with a shock: Akane is a vampire, and he bites her!\n\nAs it turns out, Akane raised Mimiko for the sole purpose of drinking her virgin blood, which will extend his life and that of his vampire clan by hundreds of years. Mimiko is distraught, but she can't shake the feeling that there is more to their relationship than that of just predator and prey. However, it is said that if a vampire falls in love, they will die. What will become of Akane and Mimiko, and can love grow amidst so much betrayal?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
