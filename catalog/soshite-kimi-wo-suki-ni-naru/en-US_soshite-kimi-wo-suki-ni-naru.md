## Sinopse

I'm in love with you. Like, the kind where I want you to make love to me. 10 years after losing his wife, Haru receives this confession from his step-son Ryo. The two may not be related by blood but have up to this point lived a peaceful life as a family. Haru doesn't want for their relationship to change. He just wants things to stay as they are so nothing is broken. But love doesn't always work like that. "Playing Family," the carefully written story of a step-dad battling his emotions for his step-son, and other sentimental love stories are contained in this bittersweet volume.
