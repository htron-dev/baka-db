## Sinopse

Aya Hanamura is a perfect student at an all-girls school. One day, a voice calls out to her and puts her in a trance. She doesn't remember that she received a crystal ball from an old lady. Now every night, Aya has nightmares where she is in a trance-like state, walking to a feudal castle to get her blood sucked by the vampire samurai nobleman.
