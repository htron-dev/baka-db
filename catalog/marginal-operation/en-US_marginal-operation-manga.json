Unwilling to return to his old NEET ways, he applies online to a private military security company, thinking the benefits to be promising. After what appears to be a baffling test, he's assigned to be an \"operator of operators\" and begins his training in a foreign country.\n\nLittle does he know, the life of a private mercenary is far more grueling than he could have ever imagined!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",
