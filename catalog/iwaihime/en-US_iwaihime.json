    "sinopse": "In the story, for generations the men of the Susuhara family have, upon reaching a certain age, left home and gone their own way, living alone with no one to depend on until they are acknowledged. The protagonist is a high school student who has left home and is comfortable at his new school. But there's a strange girl named Toe Kurokami. She carries what appears to be Japanese doll, and he's sure its hair grows and it whispers things. Meeting her might be his destiny.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
