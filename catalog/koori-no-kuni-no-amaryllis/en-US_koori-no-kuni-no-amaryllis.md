## Sinopse

The ice age had come, the whole world locked under the layer of ice. Humans maintained dormant in cold sleep facilities called 'The Snow Princess'. The robots responsible for taking care of them formed a small village and lived forever underground.

Amaryllis, a young girl robot, as the vice-chief of the village, worked hard every day with other villagers to repair 'The Snow Princess' that had been damaged by the collapsing incident and its aging components. This was all for being able to walk hand-in-hand with humans to the future.

But one day, the village chief made a statement that shocked Amaryllis and her companions.

"I believe humans ought to perish."

What decisions would they finally make? This is a heartwarming story of the robots' choice of life.
