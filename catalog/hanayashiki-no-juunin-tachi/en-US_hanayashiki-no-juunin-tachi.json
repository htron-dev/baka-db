His grandfather and father are really strict about gender roles and beats Aki up everytime he does a thing that women would usually do, like cleaning. His grandfather gets fed up with his actions and to teach him a lesson he sends him to live at one of the dorms at an all girls' school that he runs, the dorm is called Hanayashiki (Flower Estate). Is meat-loving Kitahiro Renge gonna help him... or make his life more crazy?\n\n(Source: Pink Everlasting Dream)",
