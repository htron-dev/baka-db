    "sinopse": "Emilia, the only daughter of a wealthy commoner, falls in love with the charismatic aristocratic Dominique. The homely Emilia, understanding the purpose of property, rejects his advances. A stoke of misfortune then forces her to withdrawal from society and change her name to Emma. No longer a woman of means, Emma becomes a governess for the Earl of Chard's progeny.\n\n(Source: M-U)",
