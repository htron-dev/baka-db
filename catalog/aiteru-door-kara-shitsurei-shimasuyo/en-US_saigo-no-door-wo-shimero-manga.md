## Sinopse

Nagai is just your typical office guy...except that he’s had a secret crush on his coworker Saitou for ages. But with Saitou’s massive wedding just around the corner, Nagai realizes that it’s finally time to retire his illicit desire for the adorable young man. However, sly Honda has a few teasing tricks up his own sleeve...and once the beer starts flowing, there’s no telling where the night will end! Is this love triangle destined to tumble, or will it evolve into the most tantalizing tryst ever?
