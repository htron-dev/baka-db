## Sinopse

Shun Takahata finds his daily life boring and uneventful—that is, until his teacher's head explodes. Out of the remains of the corpse comes forth a Daruma doll, marking the beginning of a sadistic game. All who move when the Daruma is looking will be killed, and the winner is the one to push the button on the Daruma's back.

Shun manages to remain calm through the slaughter of his classmates and becomes the sole victor in his class. But upon the game's completion, he finds that he is still locked inside the school and is forced to play through another hellish event. Who exactly is concocting these mysterious games, and is there any end in sight? Shun gives his all to find other survivors and work together to survive the Daruma's murderous tests.
