    "sinopse": "Raleigh, a notorious playboy of London society, wakes up after drunkenly visiting a country vicarage to find Jane, the vicar's daughter, sleeping next to him. Without any memory of what happened, he marries her to uphold appearances. A vicar's daughter and a rogue viscount... the two are so different, they just can't get along. Eventually, the two head to an estate left to Raleigh by his late great-uncle. But the estate turns out to be a seemingly haunted mansion, like one might find in a Gothic novel...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
