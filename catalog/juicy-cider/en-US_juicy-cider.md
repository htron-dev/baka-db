## Sinopse

High schooler Takayuki is considered a cool elite; all his peers are sure his thoughts are about nothing but serious, important subjects. However, they're mostly just wild fantasies about his childhood friend, the cute but simple Ken. Using all his cunning and wiles, Takayuki's determined to win over Ken.
