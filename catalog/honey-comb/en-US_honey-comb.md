## Sinopse

These stories chronicle the everyday working life of the staff of the Cafe & Restaurant Honey Comb. The main character, college student and waiter Mitarai Tsutomu, interacts with the various quirky female waitresses. These girls include the cute Megumi, who happens to be obsessed with Gundam, the angsty and hungry Ritsuko, cheerful and large-breasted Mai, who nicknamed Mitarai "toilet", and the mysterious head waitress Taeko, who never speaks.
