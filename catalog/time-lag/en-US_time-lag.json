    "sinopse": "Satoru Tendou, a cameraman for the school newspaper, has confessed his love to track star and childhood friend Shirou Sawaguchi every spring since entering high school. Each year Shirou has rejected him claiming that his confession is a sick joke. As the spring of their third year approaches, Satoru is starting to wonder if he should give up on his unrequited love or risk being rejected a third time. Will Satoru be able to convince Shirou that his love is genuine? Or will Seiichi Hiro, the editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, steal Satoru away before he and Shirou can reconcile their differences? (Source: DMP)",
