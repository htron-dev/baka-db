## Sinopse

For the campaign fund, Kaho starts working part time at a family restaurant. Because of her nervousness, she accidentally injured her workmate, Shin, who is a handsome university student. As a result, she has to work with him on a same shift everyday. His cold attitude scares Kaho, but there is actually a gentle and considerate side of him!
