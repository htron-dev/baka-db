## Sinopse

Itsuki Kanda is a suit-wearing playgirl, who has a lot of female fans in her office. She encourages them in every way, because she likes being the object of admiration by women. Her co-worker Kyaka Nishino is neither besotted by Itsuki nor interested in her, and is confused as to why the girls go so gaga over her, when she's such a gigolo. Despite not being "interested" in Itsuki, Kyaka's a good friend and an important tsukkomi to Itsuki's boke.
