    "sinopse": "\"Cute\" is not a word to describe Kaho. In fact, the best word to describe her is \"porcupine\" with her prickly personality and the tendency to say the exact opposite of what she means. All in all, even Kaho doubts that she would ever get a guy to like her. But then fellow Basketball club member Arata asks her out (much to everyone elses confusion). Will this porcupine's spines keep Arata away, or will Kaho learn to say what she really means?\n\nIncluded one-shots: Stand By Me, Yamaarashi",
