## Sinopse

This Manga doesn't actually have any plot since it is a Manga-how to" rather than a work of fiction.

Broken down into 3 parts, the first part is a series of lessons by Akira Toriyama on how to draw Manga (including what not to do), this part is rather amusing to read. The second part is a series of technical pointers from Akira Sakuma, this part is less amusing than the first. The last section is comprised of comments made by Toriyama in regards to amateur Manga work sent in to him in a contest sponsored by Shonen Jump.
