## Sinopse

Katsuragi, a boxing instructor, has a habit of falling asleep at a bar he frequents, oblivious to the fact that the son of the bar's owner - who also happens to be a student of his, is kissing him every day!

Apart from this couple, who are set apart by their age difference, you can also enjoy the passionate romance between Ichiha, a menacing boxer in the ring but shy outside of it, and Hironari, a fellow boxer who finds him endearing. A collection of love stories between ardent youth at the gym! ♥
