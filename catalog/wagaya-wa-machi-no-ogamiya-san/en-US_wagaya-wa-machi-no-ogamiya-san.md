## Sinopse

16-year-old Koharu Sakurai, from Tokyo, ended up skipping the end of middle school due to certain reasons. At that time, at the invitation of her grandmother Yoshino who lives in Kyoto, she ends up living and working part-time at the traditional general store "Sakura An" in Gion. Besides Yoshino, there’s her uncle, Soujirou, a traditional sweet confectioner, and her second cousin, the beautiful Kyoto gentleman Reito. Surrounded by this lively family, Koharu’s heart slowly begins to open up, however, "Sakura An" and her family are hiding something...!?
