## Sinopse

The "psychic battle story" centers on Tsurushige (in the game, the avatar is either a male or female), a person who awakens one day and finds that they have acquired psychic powers. They receive a red letter from the government, drafting them into a secret "special squad" within the police force, and they begin to face mythical events.
