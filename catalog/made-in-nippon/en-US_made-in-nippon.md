## Sinopse

Due to a childhood trauma Keiko has a really bad Gaijin Complex. She can't even stand the looks of blonde and blue-eyed people! Luckily of course there aren't that much people around in Japan, and so Keiko can live more or less happily waiting for the return of her love Takara from the U.S.A. Eventually he does return but there's some small surprise for Keiko: He has a blonde and blue-eyed stepbrother! And he seems to be very interested in Keiko.
