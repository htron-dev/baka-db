    "sinopse": "Udagawa is scared of being hated by people, and acts a lot brighter than he is. One day, he is paired with the unsociable Watabe for an assignment, and is told \"I hate people like you\" when he tries to talk to him. After receiving such a shock, he gradually starts speaking more frankly to Watabe and finds himself feeling comfortable around him. Wanting to be liked by him, Udagawa tells him his true feelings. Before he knew it, Watabe had turned into a precious \"true friend\" to him...\n\n(Source: MU)",
