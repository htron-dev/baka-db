## Sinopse

High-school girl Togawa Masaki, born and raised in Osaka, just recently moved to Tokyo to attend Kentei Academy. She chose to move because of a boy named Miyano Amata. Miyano is a model student in every way, but he has a dark secret. He dresses up as a girl and assumes the character of Amane in order to get closer to a girl he likes, Konishi Nozomi. The only classmate that knows his secret is Togawa and Miyano wants to keep it that way. This is the direct sequel to Fudanshism and you can see all the same characters and some new ones too!
