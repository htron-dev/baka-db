    "sinopse": "Minegishi is a handsome, friendly salaryman rising through the ranks at work. He does have one insatiable desire at the office: he loves to feed his grumpy co-worker, Ootsu. Ootsu might be taking the food, but he's not taking the bait—he thinks Minegishi's coolness is a challenge, and refuses to be charmed like everyone else in the office! But the best way to a man's heart is through his stomach, and Minegishi's attention might be reflecting a hunger for something more. Can he break through Ootsu's hard shell?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
