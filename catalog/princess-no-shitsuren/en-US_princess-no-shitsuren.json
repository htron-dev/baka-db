    "sinopse": "Living alone in the Colorado Rockies, U.S. Marshal Dan Mason didn't want company. Still, Dan couldn't resist a damsel in distress, especially when a hiking accident left violet-eyed \"Angel\" on his doorstep with no memory and no identity. Even if sharing his tiny cabin with this mysterious, vulnerable beauty was pure temptation!\n\nAngel might not know who she was, but she was sure she'd never encountered a sexy lone wolf like Dan before. He had closed off his heart behind a thorny wall, but Angel could see beyond his gruff exterior. She was determined to bring Dan back to life...though it was going to take more than one steamy kiss to do the trick!\n\nAdaptation of English fiction Sleeping with Beauty by Laura Wright.",
