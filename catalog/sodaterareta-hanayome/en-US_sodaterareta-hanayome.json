    "sinopse": "On the night of her birthday, Liliana gave her virginity to Izar. She wanted her guardian, whom she had been in love with for ten years, to love her back for even a moment. But it was a huge mistake—Izar proposed to her, not out of love, but because of their night together. Liliana was then shipped away to Switzerland to be trained to become the \"perfect wife.\" An obedient, chaste and unloved wife... No matter how much she loves him, he never reciprocates...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
