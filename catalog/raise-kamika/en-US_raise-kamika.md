## Sinopse

Abandoned by his parents, Raise Ookuni decides to live the rest of his life alone—until a fateful encounter with the new transfer student, Kamika Mikami, makes him question his resolve. Underneath her volatile exterior, Kamika holds a fierce passion for drawing manga, and she wishes to be a published author someday. However, things take a turn for the bizarre when the pair is suddenly transported to a different world and attacked by a mythical creature. Apparently, the after-school club they belong to is secretly dedicated to eradicating evil spirits!

Through a series of unfortunate events, they find themselves caught up in the divine realm's power struggle. And the only way to protect what they hold dear seems to be hidden in the memories they no longer have...
