    "sinopse": "\"I don't want to make music anymore.\"\n\nSatoshi, a boy with a hoarse voice, appears in front of Akito, who thought so. But moved by his voice, Akito begins to write songs again. Slender and friendly as a dog, Satoshi grows closer and closer to Akito, who takes good care of him. Then one day, Satoshi appears with a large amount of luggage in his hands, asking to stay at Akito's house...\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)",
