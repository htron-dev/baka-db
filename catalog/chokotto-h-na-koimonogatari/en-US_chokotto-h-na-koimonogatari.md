## Sinopse

Platonic relationships are becoming rare today. This is a collection of "Flower Comics" love stories written by seven writers.

1. Naisho No Doukyonin (Secret Housemate) [Shimaki Ako]
   Sweet short story of a middle school boy in love with a high school girl. She is meticulous about wanting to know everything about the person she is dating. Her emotion conflict when she meets this middle school boy, who challenges her way of thinking about relationship. The author diligently places the character in a muddled, flustered, and distraught air of insecure emotions. She feels baffled because she can't comprehend why she likes him, even though she knows nothing about him. (Also published in Iinazuke Ryokan)
