## Sinopse

Ohmi Crown Prince Matisa has been ousted and ordered to go to the province of Daites and wed its young lady, Miliana. Known for its isolation, Daites serves as a place where he will never be able to rally influence—the perfect place for the banished prince.

Contrary to expectations however, Daites is secretly a booming province of wealth and innovation. The source behind this is Miliana herself, who bears memories of her past life in modern-day Japan. Using her photographic memory, she has introduced advanced technology, new forms of transportation, infrastructure, and even weaponry. While she boasts these enormous achievements, Miliana's biggest motivation is her obsession with boys' love! Being a major fujoshi, she wants to introduce BL culture into everyday life.

As she and Matisa prepare for a war on the horizon, they must both protect Daites, whose innovations may serve as a powder keg to ignite a new age of warfare, and spread the word of pure, male-male love!
