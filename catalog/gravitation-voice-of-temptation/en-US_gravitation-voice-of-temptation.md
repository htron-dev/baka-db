## Sinopse

During a break on his premiere tour for the smash-hit pop band Bad Luck, lead singer Shuichi Shindo comes home to spend some quality time with his boyfriend, Eiri Yuki, the famous romance novelist. However, he finds their apartment empty and the only thing waiting for him is a mysterious, alarming note. Has something horrible happened to his lover? Does it have any connection to that gorgeous lady who's been stalking the writer for the past few weeks?

Based on the popular manga and anime, Gravitation: Voice of Temptation is a highly charged, hilarious story about two lovers drawn together despite the overwhelming odds.
