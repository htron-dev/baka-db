    "sinopse": "Yui Komori has been residing with the Sakamaki brothers—Shuu, Reiji, Ayato, Kanato, Laito, and Subaru—ever since her priest father abandoned her in Japan in favor of an Eastern European assignment. All of a sudden, another family of vampires joins the scene, with the aim of disturbing the fragile peace that she has been living in.\n\nThe Mukamis—Ruki, Kou, Yuma, and Azusa—try to entice Yui away with talk of how she is \"Eve,\" and should be free to choose her desired \"Adam\" with whom to create powerful descendants. The possessive Sakamakis already fight over her amongst themselves, and they become increasingly territorial when they perceive that other vampires are trying to steal their prey. Yui witnesses the contrast between both families' methods of persuasion, but she does not need encouragement nor punishment to remain loyal to the Sakamakis. In the end, her heart is the deciding factor, and she cannot escape the emotional bonds that have developed between one of the brothers and herself.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
