    "sinopse": "Yuuri, a 30-year-old housewife who was unilaterally abandoned in marriage, suddenly gets lost in a different world. She, who was introduced to the work of potion harvesting by an S-class adventurer and gradually got used to life in a different world, realized the ridiculous secret of the harvested potion. The potion without the recovery function that she thought was off was actually soy sauce. In addition, dishes made with it have a bonus of correction function! Will Yuuri's dishes change the common sense of the other world?\n\n(Source: Futabasha, translated)",
