    "sinopse": "Anpanman's friends get the spotlight in this collection of three adventures. In the first, Baikinman kidnaps Anpanman and others and it's up to the toddler Aka-chanman to save them from Baikinman's dangerous amusement park, the Baikin-dome! The next story takes place in a wild west setting, where Baikinman and his Kabi Gang are hijacking train deliveries. SLman, a steam locomotive, and Currypanman agree to make an important food delivery, but can they overcome Baikinman's Gang? The third and last segment has Anpanman and his friends building handmade vehicles to go on a trip together, and as each new one joins the group, they sing their theme songs, creating an Anpanman song medley!\n\n(Source: Shiteater Fansubs)",
