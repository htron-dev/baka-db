## Sinopse

The film's story centers on Princess Vanilla, a princess in a land of ice cream, but who nevertheless is unable to create ice cream herself, no matter how much she practices every day. Finally fed up with her lack of ability, she flees her palace, and soon meets Anpanman and Kokin-chan. While traveling with them, she learns the reason why she can't create ice cream. Meanwhile, Baikinman attacks the land of ice cream while Princess Vanilla is missing.
