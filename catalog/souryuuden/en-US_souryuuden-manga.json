The brothers are reborn in the modern world, complete with supernatural powers and the ability to become the Dragons they descended from. They are content to live ordinary lives until evil creatures come to attack them.\n\nIt becomes the mission of the four brothers to defeat the \"Four Sisters\", four girls from America and the descendants of the \"Bulls\", before they use their control over technology and the economy to take over the world. However, as this battle begins, the four brothers must also find their place in the world as they flee from the destructive will of the \"Bulls\".",
