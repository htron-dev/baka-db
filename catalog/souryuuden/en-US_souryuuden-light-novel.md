## Sinopse

The story features four divine Dragon Kings, each with their own kingdoms: one to the north, one to the east, one to the south, and one to the west. The brothers are reborn in the modern world, complete with supernatural powers and the ability to become the Dragons they descended from. They are content to live ordinary lives until evil creatures come to attack them.

It becomes the mission of the four brothers to defeat the "Four Sisters," four girls from America and the descendants of the "Bulls," before they use their control over technology and the economy to take over the world; however, as this battle begins, the four brothers must also find their place in the world as they flee from the destructive will of the "Bulls."
