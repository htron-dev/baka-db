    "sinopse": "On his very first day at a brand-new job, shy Shima is trapped in the elevator with a hungover mess of a guy... who turns out to be his boss! Togawa's prickly exterior definitely puts the rookie recruit on-edge, but it doesn't take long before Shima's every waking thought is invaded by his overbearing yet totally thoughtful superior. Will Shima put aside a history of disappointment in order to take a chance on a complicated relationship?\n\nNo Touching at All breaks every rule in the office handbook in the name of mixed signals, shared memories, and the sweet surrender of an after-hours liaison! Shima and Togawa butt heads both at work and in the bedroom... but their inexplicable chemistry is far too intense to ignore. Can these two men forget their painful pasts and move forward hand-in-hand?\n\n(Source: Juné)",
