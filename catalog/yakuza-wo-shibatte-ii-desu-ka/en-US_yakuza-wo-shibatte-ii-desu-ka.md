The rope artist Rui, in a sudden turn of events, started living with Natori, a yakuza of special circumstances. At first, Rui hesitated about living with a straight guy, but Natori was totally his type. Rui's reasoning and sexual desire are shaken when Natori was to act in the adult video he's working on! Can Rui control himself in the face of his heart's desire?
