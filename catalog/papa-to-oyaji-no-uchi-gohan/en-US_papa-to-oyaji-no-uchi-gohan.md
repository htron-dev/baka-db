## Sinopse

Sengoku Akira, a chiropractor, knows nothing about raising a child but finds himself in just that position when an ex-girlfriend suddenly entrusts him with their daughter, Airi. Together with his friend Harumi Masahiro—a divorced manga editor with a young son of his own—Akira figures out that the first step to being a good single dad is...knowing how to make good food. How hard can it be?
