## Sinopse

Shinobu is a typical high school girl...with an atypical hatred of boys. Long ago, she was horribly abused by one and hasn't been able to tolerate being near them since. Now Yokomizo has appeared before her—a boy who looks exactly like the one who tormented her in the past. He's the last guy she wants to have around, but then he confesses his love to her!?
