Ready to live a life of mechanical servitude, Yui, a robot maid, has just been purchased by Takaya Murase from the robotic doll distributor, MaidWorks. However, Takaya has other plans for his new servant that don't quite include cooking and cleaning house.\n\nTo her new owner, Yui is like a life-sized doll, for which he can act out his costume-dress-up fantasies. But Yui only wants to serve... Find out how this mismatched pair fares, especially once rival robot maids Minori and Ayumi enter the scene.\n\n(Source: DrMaster)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Sakura-chan Paradise♥, Wagamama Yoi☆Koi\nVolume 3: Omakase! My Sister, Manatsu no Indoor Girl",
