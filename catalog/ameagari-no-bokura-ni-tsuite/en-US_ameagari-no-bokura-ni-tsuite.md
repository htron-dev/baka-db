## Sinopse

Having given up on love, Kanade is a businessman living an unfulfilled life while hiding the fact that he is gay. On one of these days, Mashiro, a classmate Kanade secretly loved during high school, shows up. Reuniting after 6 years, their world begins to change. This is a clumsy, gentle love story between a pessimistic, pure boy and a determined, oblivious man, trying to find a sunny spot.
