## Sinopse

Son, the protagonist, was a free writer who deeply loved a woman he called 'elder sister' Shue but she was dead. Fu, an apparently young, skilful but cunning Taoist priest, re-animated Shue and used her as a zombie body guard... In order to acquire the method of full resurrection of Shue, Son became an apprentice of Fu and promised to help Fu with various unreasonable tasks. After that Son met different priests and necromancy practitioners, and he even visited the other sides of the world. Most of the stories are associated with Chinese necromancy and folklore and that is probably why it is called Necrolog.
