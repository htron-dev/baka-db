    "sinopse": "Sakura Kousuke is a boy who strives to throw away a past mired in regret. He transfers to a new school for his second year of high school, believing it will give him a chance to come clean.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, however, the appearance of five other \"Sakura\"s in his class will bring the past to his present, forcing him to come to terms with himself, his old friends, and a girl who, though being Kousuke's complete opposite in terms of personality, also knows him better than anyone else.\n\n(Source: Batoto)",
