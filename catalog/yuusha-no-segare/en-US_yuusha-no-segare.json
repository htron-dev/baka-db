    "sinopse": "On that day, an emergency family meeting was called to order at the residence of the Kenzaki family, an ordinary family living in Tokorozawa City. A blonde beauty named Dianaze Krone had appeared from a different world in the living room of the Kenzaki family, saying, \"I am an envoy, come to summon the Hero of salvation, Kenzaki Hideo.\" Wait, Hideo is my dad!\n\nTo think such a game-like situation would fall upon me, Kenzaki Yasuo, an ordinary high school student. My father is a hero, and he saved a different world in his younger days!?\n\nThere's no way I can believe that this ordinary, middle-aged father of mine is a \"Hero.\" Diana looks at me, \"The Son of the Hero\" with a gaze filled with longing and my sister who noticed that, looks at me with a cold gaze… Before bringing back peace to the other world, the peace of our family is in big trouble! What is going to happen to my peaceful everyday life!?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, Fushigi Translations)",
