    "sinopse": "Fiery and gifted for physical activity, Magma has the passion to throw balls faster and faster, but is not interested in participating in a teamwork. After repeatedly humiliating the promising pitcher of his high school, he finds out that the tennis ball travels much faster than baseball to reach 200 km/h.\n\nExcited by this revelation, he approached the world of tennis without hesitation, but without the intention of playing seriously just wants to be able to always intercept those balls. Despite this, a series of fortuitous combinations, and the interest of relatives and friends, led him to further his skills, so he can play real games.",
