## Sinopse

Kowloon City is an urban sprawl that encompasses the essence of evil. Its people live tortured lives of wretched exploitation by the crime lords who enslave them. Out of the dirty alleyways, one man emerges to shake loose the global foundations of the vast criminal underworld. This man possesses such unearthly beauty that they say whenever he enters a room; the women would become just a little bit looser. Even the men would become a little bit naughtier. But unknown to all, he carries inside of himself a personal vendetta. From Hong Kong, to New York City and to Shanghai, he seduces the rich and corrupt into destroying themselves, by turning their own unholy appetites against them. His name... Shinobu Shikata. And his unhallowed crusade has only just begun.
