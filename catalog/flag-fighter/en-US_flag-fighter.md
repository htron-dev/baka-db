## Sinopse

There is a game known as Flag Fight, a game where the player who captures 1,000 flags will control the world. Each fighter has pride in his own flag, and tries to capture the other's flag. A mighty flag fighter called Reppa Kagura uses Long (dragon) techniques to resist all the other strong fighters. One day, an old man gives him some solid advice: There is something important missing from Reppa's Long. When he hears this, Reppa decides to become this old man's disciple.
