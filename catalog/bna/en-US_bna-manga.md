## Sinopse

A society where beastmen and humans coexist.

Michiru, a high school student who suddenly turned into a tanuki beastman one day, runs away from the human anti-beastmen advocates and makes her way to "Anima City," a city where beastmen live, to search for a way to turn back into a human.

While bewildered about the differences between the human cities and etiquette and that of beastmen, she starts learning about the way beastmen live.
