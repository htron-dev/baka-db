## Sinopse

Biwa was a fledgling screenwriter working at an American TV drama production company. After three years at the company, his big break has finally come. He's been named to a drama production team. But just before the team's first meeting, Biwa, distracted, slams into a man he doesn't know, who glares at him. It's Japan's top actor, Yamato Toyohira, the star of the drama! Biwa is supposed to be his assistant, but Yamato's arrogance is driving him crazy!
