    "sinopse": "Snow White, a maiden who lives in the woods with the 7 dwarfs, suddenly decides to open a “dwarf café”! She has the support from 3 of her dwarf friends, and the Prince. Amidst the busy atmosphere of the café and making nice with the Prince (and putting up with his fetish for all things miniature), Snow White has also a rival, Rosé, the owner of another café “The Red Hood”. This 4-koma manga fairy tale parody is light-hearted, funny and cute!\n\n(Source: MU)",
