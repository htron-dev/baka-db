## Sinopse

Calgrande is a magical academy that the nobles and elite magicians attend.

A world of magical fundamentalism, where the strongest talents for the national military gather. Yuuma, a genius magician who once before saved another world, died and reincarnated to this world, and is now attending this academy for the sake of achieving a certain goal. Yuuma, who is considered the hero candidate of this generation, was living happy days with his genius sister-in-law who is also a brocon, as well as with his other sister-in-law who is a spoiled angel. However, all of this changed during a extracurricular trip to the demon world. When the evil parts of this world bare their fangs against his precious sister, the magician from the otherworld is unleashing his true power!
