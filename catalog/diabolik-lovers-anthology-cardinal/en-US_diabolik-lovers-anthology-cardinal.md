## Sinopse

When her father, a priest, left Japan to take an assignment in Eastern Europe, Yui Komori was told to live with her supposedly distant relatives. Whether or not it is true that she has common ancestry with the Sakamaki brothers—Shuu, Reiji, Ayato, Kanato, Laito, and Subaru—she definitely shares blood with them, because they are vampires and she is their prey.

Even after living with the Sakamakis for some time, Yui never knows what treatment to expect from each brother. They may call her by name or use derogatory insults, take her blood gently or violently, and rarely their expressions will look almost as if they care for her. The only constant is that the brothers are possessive and do not want to share Yui with one another. When only two of them are together, the ever-optimistic girl begins to hope that their bond will transcend bloodlust and come close to genuine affection. Is she only fooling herself?
