    "sinopse": "The boy asked the man and the man answered: \"I've been there, in the Korakuen Arena, fought against Hanayama Kaoru, it was amazing.\" The boy asked him again but this time a question that terrified him to the core: 'Where's the amusement park?\" The man had no answer.\n\nThis is a series of illustrated tales about a dark place inside the world of the Baki series, the so-called \"Amusement Park.\" Come and discover by yourself why strong men fear it so much. Take a peek at darkness itself!!!\n\n(Source: MU)",
