## Sinopse

The boy asked the man and the man answered: "I've been there, in the Korakuen Arena, fought against Hanayama Kaoru, it was amazing." The boy asked him again but this time a question that terrified him to the core: 'Where's the amusement park?" The man had no answer.

This is a series of illustrated tales about a dark place inside the world of the Baki series, the so-called "Amusement Park." Come and discover by yourself why strong men fear it so much. Take a peek at darkness itself!!!
