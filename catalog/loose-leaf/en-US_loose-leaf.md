Yuki Anno just turned into a high school student. From the beginning everything seemed to go wrong. Yuki is very nervous and what's worse, she is in a different class from her best friend Jiu. Yuki feels unwanted and decides to make new friends. Upon arriving at her new class, she is frightened to see so many people and out of class, but a boy, Yuki Saeki, grabs and welcomes her, saying it is the cousin of Jiu. Saeki receives a sheet of paper and Yuki both converse wrote. Yuki goes to see him and Jiu and says that he would like to be the manager of the football team, but was not sure because there are other girls in class that she could do better.
