## Sinopse

Winter 1989, Alaska. Blanca has escaped from a secret training camp in the Soviet bloc, counting only on his instinct to pass the Bering Strait and reach Alaska, the land of wolves. Hounded by the secret services, the genetically altered dog is driven by call of nature and of his land to continue the endless journey, embodying an ancient Inuit legend because of his extraordinary fighting skills, speed and endurance. But in his journey he comes across very dangerous enemies.
