Loneliness is a common element in these stories, but they all espouse the secret hope that we can share warmth with other people.\n\nThe stories are about: A college student starts dating a girl who may or may not be feeding him bugs, a painter is seduced by his patron so that he can create his masterpiece, a demon in training gets a crush on the human girl at the video rental store, and two boys bond over their love of movies. Gender doesn't matter when there's love involved, but love is never easy.\n\n1. Suisou no Machi\n2. Mushi no Aji ga suru\n3. Gisèle to Ester\n4. Roselyne Frau no Shouzou\n5.
