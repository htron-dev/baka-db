    "sinopse": "Seto is a completely ordinary and somewhat boring high school student; but for whatever reason, his delinquent classmate Anjou just won't leave him alone! The serious Seto and energetic Anjou make an unexpected duo, but Anjou doesn't seem to mind the contrast, as she has too much fun bullying Seto.\n\nSeto, on the other hand, is unable to deal with Anjou's shenanigans; he doesn't seem to realise that his humorous reactions are precisely the reason Anjou enjoys his company. But how much of her flirting is really just an act?\n\nYancha Gal no Anjou-san follows the entertaining daily antics of these two polar opposites, as playful teasing evolves into a treasured relationship.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
