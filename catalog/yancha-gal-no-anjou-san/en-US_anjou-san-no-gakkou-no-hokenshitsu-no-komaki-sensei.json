    "sinopse": "Seto is a completely ordinary and somewhat boring high school student. Yet, for whatever reason, his errant gyaru classmate Anjou just won't leave him alone! But this spinoff series isn’t really about them—it's more about Komaki-sensei, the school's resident nurse/therapist, as she deals with students and their troubles.\n\n(Source: MU)",
