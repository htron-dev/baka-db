## Sinopse

Consists of three stories:

1. Takayoshi, a model, models for Kairi the photographer. Kairi's intense gaze makes Takayoshi flustered... why is Kairi looking at him like that all the time?

2. Ryuu Saezaki and Sakura Nozomi are rivals in the cram school. Sakura is the son of a famous politician so he's never given any freedom and doesn't even have friends! One day, Ryuu meets Sakura in the park but Sakura is not being himself... he tells Ryuu he likes him and kisses him. Is this an act or a case if split personality?

3. 1st year Chihiro was accepted to a prestigious music school and his roomate is the oh so popular 2nd year Wataru. All the guys want to sleep with Wataru who says he's not gay... but then why does he keep teasing Chihiro?!

... and an omake - a short extra featuring all the characters in this volume.
