## Sinopse

Cyborg 009 is the story of a half-Japanese juvenile delinquent, Shimamura Joe AKA 'Cyborg 009.' 'Black Ghost,' a top-secret organization bent on promoting global warfare, kidnaps Joe along with eight other unwanted members of society from the four corners of the world and turns them into cyborgs. Though the organization intends to turn the group into super-powered killing machines, it's not long before Joe and his new companions rebel against Black Ghost and make their escape with the help of an old scientist.

Once Joe and friends have freed themselves, Black Ghost sends a series of other cyborgs and giant robots in hot pursuit. Using their new powers and abilities, our heroes stay one step ahead of Black Ghost and its evil machinations, but can they save the world from its diabolical scheme?
