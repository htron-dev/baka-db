## Sinopse

Eiji Fuwa is a former journalist, who traveled extensively in countries engulfed by war. Now he works as a temporary English school teacher. Eiji is so calm and relaxed that it seems almost glacial, but the Japanese student's amorphous side surprises him. Overhelmed by the death of too many children in countries at war he has visited, Eiji is given the mission to assist these students in trouble!
