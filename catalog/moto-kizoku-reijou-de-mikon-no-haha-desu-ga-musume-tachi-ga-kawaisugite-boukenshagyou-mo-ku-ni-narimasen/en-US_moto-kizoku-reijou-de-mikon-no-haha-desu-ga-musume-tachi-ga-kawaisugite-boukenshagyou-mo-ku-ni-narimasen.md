## Sinopse

A world where monsters run rampant. A noblewoman falls from grace and loses everything after being falsely accused. But, she started a fresh life as an "Immortal." She became an adventurer capable of defeating disaster-rank monsters and taking the heads off ancient dragons with a single swing of her blade. However, behind that cool exterior... beats the heart of a ridiculously over-indulgent mother!?

"What should I do, my daughters are just too cute!?"

She wields her deadly sword for the sake of motherly love! Ogres flee and dragons tremble at the sight of this overpowered adventurer! The fantasy adventure of the Doting Mother Sword Demon begins now!
