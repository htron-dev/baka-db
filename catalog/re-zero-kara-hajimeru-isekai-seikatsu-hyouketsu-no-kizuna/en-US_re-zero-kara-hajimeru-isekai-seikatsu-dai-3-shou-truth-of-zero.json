    "sinopse": "The Royal Capital, the city of Lugunica, has been in disarray ever since losing its king. Now without a figurehead, the royal family collapses, and the government must immediately hold an election to decide on his successor. Subaru Natsuki, who unknowingly saved the insignia that made Emilia a Royal Election candidate, accompanies her to an important meeting.\n\nWhile in the capital, Emilia insists that Subaru stay behind and repose following the demon beast attack, despite the fact he would do anything besides that. However, when Subaru sees Emilia being ill-treated by both the citizens and her fellow candidates, will he be able to keep his promise to the one he loves most?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
