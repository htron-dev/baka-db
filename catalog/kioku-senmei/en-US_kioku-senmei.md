## Sinopse

In the year 20XX the vast city of New York is under constant terrorist attacks at public places. The police is clueless and the culprit is roaming the city free. The police’s only witness died, and her clones are useless, so they are left with no choice but to receive the help of Jojo Schmit of the EPIA section, a section dedicated to ESP related phenomena.
