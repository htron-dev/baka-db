## Sinopse

Uta Naruse's first love moved beyond her reach before she could fully realize her feelings. Kaoru, her childhood friend and the object of her affection, married Uta's brother, Reiichi. Due to some difficulties with her parents, Uta now lives with the joyful newlyweds. After a year of sharing a home with her crush, Uta finds it increasingly difficult to come to terms with her feelings. Her only solace comes from relaying her troubles to her friend and confidant, Kuroe.

Grappling with what she imagines to be a forever unrequited love, Uta is unable to find peace. However, recent events hint at issues in Kaoru and Reiichi's marriage. Perhaps they are not as happy as Uta imagined.
