However, one of her acquaintances, Sonhi, hates her for reasons that Yuna does not understand. Unfortunately, Sonhi's father is the head of a major bank and she uses her influence to destroy Yuna's father's company, leading directly to his suicide.\n\nNow Yuna has to shoulder the responsibility of caring for her mother and her little brother, dropping out of school to find work and breaking up with her high-class boyfriend. However, not only is Korea in a major financial crisis, but Sonhi is further interfering to ensure that Yuna is unable to find respectable work. Yuna realizes that she must enter the night world of hostessing, in order to provide for her family.\n\nShe may be seen as a 'fallen woman,' but she will not be defeated forever! She and her family are determined that they will survive this disaster and find a new life on the other side!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
