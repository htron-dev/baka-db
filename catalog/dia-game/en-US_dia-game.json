    "sinopse": "Daia has never harmed any humans, but nonetheless, he has been chased by the vampire hunter association for all his life. One hunter in particular, Kuro, is always trailing closely behind him. Out of desperation, Daia flees England and seeks freedom in a foreign country.\n\nArriving in Japan, Daia meets Shishou, who offers protection and a place to stay. Daia thinks he may be falling for this generous man, but he is well aware that if he were to feed on Shishou—or attempt to transform him—then his days on the run from Kuro would begin in earnest.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
