## Sinopse

Dependent on her boyfriend for seven years, unable to communicate well with others, and lacking self-confidence, Miki feels like a bird trapped in a gilded cage. In the midst of all this she meets callous young man, Kamaya, at her post in the students affairs office. Although Kamaya seems to have no qualms about invading her personal space, he saves her when she's in trouble, and Miki gradually begins to see him in a new light.
