    "sinopse": "Mizuki is the female \"prince\" of her all-girls school and the lead guitarist in an all-girl rock band. Akira is the male \"princess\" of his all-boys school and wants to join her band. Love may be on his mind, but romance is difficult when everyone keeps mistaking Mizuki for a boy and Akira for a girl!\n\nWhen the lead singer of Blaue Rosen announces she is moving overseas, Akira does all he can to convince Mizuki and her bandmates to let him join. But will a resistant Mizuki allow him into her band, much less her heart?\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
