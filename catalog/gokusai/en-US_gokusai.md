## Sinopse

Art equals expression, an expression creating an outer form, expressing joy, sorrow, and the darkness of the soul. Yutou Riro is a student at an art college, but she believes she lacks the talent to truly succeed as an artist. Entering her life through a series of coincidences is Karaba Jou. To Riro's astonishment, Jou has an exceptional ability to draw the "real" self of the people/object he draws. His artwork draws attention to the finest details of his subject, bringing to light the truth behind each individual.
