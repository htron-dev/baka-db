    "sinopse": "Yamagata Tatsumi and his family were traveling in their car when a wild truck smashed into their car, and killed everyone but him. With his entire family dead and relatives abandoning him, the only one remaining by his side was his pet cockatiel, Chiiko. For a year he lived only with his pet, who had been with him since childhood. But finally, her lifespan reached its end and she died in his arms.\n\nAfter his pet died, he lost his will to live and spent everyday meaninglessly. But, ever since her death, every night he dreamed about a girl praying inside a room made of stone. One day, while reminiscing and playing on his acoustic guitar the song he used to sing together with his pet, suddenly the area around his bed began to shine, and the scenery around him changed. He was still on his bed, but the room turned into the one from his dreams, and the girl was there. The girl was teary eyed and then jumped upon and embraced him. The girl, Holy Woman Calzedonia, smiled brightly and said: \"Finally... finally we meet again, master... I am your pet... Chiiko!\"\n\n(Source: Novel Updates, edited)",
