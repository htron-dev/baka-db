    "sinopse": "Alex's life was moving in a dream direction. A beautiful prima ballerina with a promising career, she had long ago sacrificed many things—including her first love—to pursue her dream of dancing on the world's most prestigious stages.\n\nWhen fate strikes Alex a terrible blow, and a devastating injury leaves her unable to dance. As if the loss of her hard-earned career wasn't enough, Alex is shocked when the first visitor to call on her in the hospital is Scott - the man whose love she denied to pursue her dream to dance. Will fate strike another devastating blow to the fallen ballerina, or does Scott have something more to offer her than a regretful look at a long-lost love?\n\n(Source: Dark Horse)",
