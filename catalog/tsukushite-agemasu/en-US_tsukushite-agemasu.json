    "sinopse": "Yuzuko's a positive, always charming girl with the horrible habit of verbal diarrhea. Just when she’s done it again and insults someone, she's saved by a drop dead gorgeous maid from a maid cafe. Little does she know (though the readers are more clued in than this poor girl) that the maid is none other than the high school hottie Itsuki—who's only doing it as the #1 most popular maid at his father's Maid & Butler cafe. It's really a story about love and some pretty good maid costumes.\n\n(Source: ShoujoReviews)\n\nIncluded one-shots: When the Fireworks End, My Hysterical Girl",
