## Sinopse

Kotone was actually a sloppy person no matter how COOL she acted as a teacher at school. One day, when one of her students, Miyama-kun, asked a favor from her, she ended up staying at his house. Kotone discovered that she could be like herself when she was with Miyami. Thus, had slowly forgotten her duties as a teacher.
