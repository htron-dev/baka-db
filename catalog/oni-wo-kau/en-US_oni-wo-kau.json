There, they meet the shop owner, an old man named Shouten, who deals with exotic wildlife - both ordinary and unordinary: demon beasts. Fascinated by the mysterious beasts the shop holds, Motoi agrees to work and raise a demon. Motoi's journey of encountering different demon beasts begins.\n\n(Source: MU)",
