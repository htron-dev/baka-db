## Sinopse

Ichinosuke, failed to get a job for 100 consecutive times. Furthermore, his record is still being renewed and on the way to another job interview, he was involved in an accident with a truck and tragically passed away. Fortunately for him, a Goddess bestowed upon him the ability to grow at a speed 400 times faster than normal, before sending him to a game-like world.

Knowing that he would not become stronger even if continued growing while jobless, he aimed to get a job, but found out that it was just his terrible fate to remain jobless forever. As Growth and Jobless cheats existed side-by-side in this world, an adventure record, no doubt certified by the job-placement agency as a harmful book, begins here.
