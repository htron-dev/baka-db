## Sinopse

Yuuki's got the hots for Shirahama. All he's got to do is confess his undying love for her. The only problem is: he just can't do it! Every time he tries to tell her how he feels, he ends up chickening out. His life then completely changes when he runs into a robotic beauty named Ai Roborovskii. She's earth's first Erotic Robot, and her sexy "features" aren't just for show. She was created to save the world with her incredible erotic powers!
