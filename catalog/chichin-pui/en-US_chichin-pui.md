## Sinopse

Ren holds a one-sided love for her childhood friend Chikara, who's into the paranormal (ghosts, etc). One day on her way home, she helps an old man who falls over in the middle of the road. In acknowledgement of her kindness, he gives her a doll made of wool string, which he says will help her in love. But how could it possibly do that?
