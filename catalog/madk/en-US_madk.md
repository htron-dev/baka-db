Labeled "abnormal" because of his twisted personality, Makoto, who suffered all alone for so long decided one day, half in doubt, to pick up a "Grimoire" and use it’s instructions to summon a demon. And who would appear but the intense, intensely beautiful—and intensely talkative—Archduke of Hell, J.
