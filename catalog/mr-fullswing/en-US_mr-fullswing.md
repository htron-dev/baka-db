## Sinopse

Saruno Amakuni feels as though he is the last high school boy on earth without a girlfriend and it's not looking like things are going to improve any time soon. He's not the brightest crayon in the box, has a knack for getting into trouble, and the only way he can get a girl to so much as look at him is by watching her undress in the locker room - and earning a smack in the process. He comes to a wild conclusion that maybe, perhaps maybe what girls really want is a guy who is in a sports club. He eventually settles on the baseball clubs in hopes of winning the heart of the manager, Nagi Torii, but despite his incessant bragging, he's a total beginner!
