## Sinopse

Hikaru, Fuu, and Umi are once again transported to Cephiro. But, with the Pillar gone, they don't know how they could have been transported back. As they meet up with old friends, they find that Cephiro is now crumbling because they do not have a pillar. They also find that gates from other worlds have opened, and the leaders want the Pillar to themselves for their own selfish reasons. Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu must now set out to save Cephiro form dying.
