## Sinopse

Mu-Sang’s has a quest... He must find and kill every “Gwi” that has ever existed. He is determined, and won’t let anything get in his way, not even the imperial army!

While traveling and searching for the remnants of Gwi, he meets a girl who also bears the same mark crossed out than he has. A fateful encounter? Were those two fated to meet? And why does he hold such a grudge against the “Gwi”? ... all are questions left to be answered!
