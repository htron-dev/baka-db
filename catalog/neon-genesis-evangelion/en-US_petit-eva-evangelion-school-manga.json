    "sinopse": "The series is the \"first official super-deformed series\" based on Neon Genesis Evangelion. The Gainax/Khara franchise spin-off spoofs the psychological science fiction drama by reimagining the characters as classmates in Tokyo-3's Nerv School, headed by Principal Gendou Ikari and Misato-sensei. The student body includes three different Rei \"sisters,\" the EVA-01 mobile weapon reimagined as the school bully Evanchou, and the ill-fated Jet Alone robot as JA-ko, a \"hidden character\" in the form of a shy android girl.",
