## Sinopse

Mysterious invaders are threatening Earth...so recruit a group of elite schoolkids to play video games that secretly train them for the real fight that lies ahead! Does this plan sound familiar? Well, they'd better get a new plan, because the elite schoolkids are Shinji, Rei, Asuka, and Kaworu, and they're too busy playing games to ever get in the fricking robot!
