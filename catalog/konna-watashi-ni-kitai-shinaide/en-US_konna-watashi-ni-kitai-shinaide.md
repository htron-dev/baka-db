## Sinopse

When anyone walks by Elicia, they immediately notice that she is a cool and beautiful girl with a piercing glare. However, she is not the ice queen that everyone make her up to be. In fact, she is only creating this persona to not disappoint everyone's perception of her. Wanting to protect her image, Elicia will have to make every effort to hide her unexpected side from others.
