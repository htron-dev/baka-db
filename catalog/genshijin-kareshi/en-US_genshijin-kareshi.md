## Sinopse

Regular high school girl Mito Kamigome wants to fall in love. She gets some interest from good-looking guys, but they're all a bit...weedy. One day, the goddess of agriculture, Spica, appears to her and sends Mito back through time so she can find her kind of guy. Will Mito really meet her soulmate in the prehistoric era? Only time will tell...
