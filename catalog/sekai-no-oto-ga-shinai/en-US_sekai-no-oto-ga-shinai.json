    "sinopse": "Chitose is quite popular and yet he has nothing he could get himself into and had no experience of falling in love. This made Chitose annoyed with himself. One day after school, he found Noiri in the music room playing the piano, and decided to learn the cello from him. It was just something that started from a whim, but as they spend time together, Chitose fell for Noiri. But it seems, Noiri is hiding a secret...?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
