## Sinopse

Sora, a high school girl who loves her family, hurt her back after carrying her sleeping younger brother and went to the infirmary. It seems like she was having a wonderful dream whilst taking a break but, when she woke up... the beautiful Arashi Tsukinose was sleeping in the same bed as her! It seems like Sora has been chosen by Arashi-kun to be by his side to help him sleep?? Although you'd think that NOBODY at the age of 16 needs a sleeping buddy, the sound of her heartbeat is resonating with the multi talented pretty boy. Ayu Watanabe's attention drawing new story is an intimate romance that starts from sleeping side by side...
