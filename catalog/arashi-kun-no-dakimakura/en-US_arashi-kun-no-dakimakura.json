    "sinopse": "Sora, a high school girl who loves her family, hurt her back after carrying her sleeping younger brother and went to the infirmary. It seems like she was having a wonderful dream whilst taking a break but, when she woke up... the beautiful Arashi Tsukinose was sleeping in the same bed as her! It seems like Sora has been chosen by Arashi-kun to be by his side to help him sleep??

Ayu Watanabe's attention drawing new story is an intimate romance that starts from sleeping side by side...\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
