## Sinopse

When Gon, a playful orphaned fox, finds that young Hyoju has lost his mother, he tries to comfort him and makes amends for his own earlier mischief by secretly bringing small gifts to the boy every day.

But Hyoju doesn't realize who is behind the anonymous gifts, and the two are headed for a heartbreaking climax.
