    "sinopse": "Even when Naono-sensei comes down to earth and writes about schoolboys and salarymen, there's still some magic about them, something that clearly separates them from the others. In 'Yokubou Shounen', there's only one story that takes us to the fantastic; the rest are tales about more or less ordinary people.\n\nIn the first two one-shots we'll get to meet a teacher, Matsunae Suguru, and his handsome, self-searching young student Shinobu, and then again Shinobu, causing confusion between his two schoolmates, Hideya and Makoto, who are hopelessly in love - but sweetly clueless about how to get it going. The third story, 'Love Snatcher', is an absolutely gorgeous fantasy. Once again Naono-sensei proves her skill at drawing animals, and the mysterious Tigure is truly an eyeful. The last two one-shots are very emotional, painted with doubt and misunderstandings, and the fact that Naono-sensei is a master at creating unique individuals really shows this time as well.\n\nConsists of a collection of oneshots:\n\n1. A Desire Boy (Yokubou Shounen)\n\n2. Sawaki's Case\n\n3. Love Snatcher- After getting fired from his job half Japanese Tanaka Tatsuaki drunkenly prays to the moon to take him away, and it does! He's been summoned to a land of shape-shifters to be the bride of Tigure, lord of the tigers. And he's expected to give birth?\n\n4. Love and Reticence (Ai to Chinmoku)-Nearly silent ghost writer Kisa has fallen in love with a small out of the way diner and the delicious food there. But handsome owner-san wants more from Kisa than his patronage.\n\n5. Drowning in Love (Oboreru Kankei)- Yoshino Keiichi's life has gotten a lot more interesting since single father Kayumi Takamasa and his two young children moved in next door. Keiichi's become a mother to the youngsters, but his relationship with their father is much more complex...\n\nSource: MangaFox",
