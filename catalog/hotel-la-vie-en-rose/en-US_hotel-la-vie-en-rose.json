    "sinopse": "Tachibana Kaori accidentally spends a night at the luxurious—and expensive—Hotel La Vie en Rose. Without enough money to pay the accommodation fee, the receptionist of the hotel Kyuno tells her that she has no choice but to work off her debt. Kyuno is a sadistic penny-pinching mystery and no one of the hotel seems to know of his past. Still, as bossy as he is, Kaori finds herself opening up to him about her own traumatic history...and perhaps, Kyuno might have a gentle side after all.\n\n(Source: Dazzling Scans)",
