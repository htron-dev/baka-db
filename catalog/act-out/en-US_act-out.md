## Sinopse

Ibara Nayuki is a figure skater who is active all over the world. However, he has no desire to behave a certain way to appeal to the public, is appalled by the audience and is overwhelmed by his coach. Vassily, a ballet dancer once called a prodigy, appears before him.

Two people who are stagnated in their lives meet, and their lives move.
