## Sinopse

A former child model hitting a rough patch, Keel enters a contract with Seiji Kanakawa. For one month, Keel is a live-in prostitute for Seiji and fulfills all of his requests, even requests to have Keel dress as a girl and top him. Keel grins and bears it since he is being paid good money. But, even though their relationship starts with a contract, what will happen when emotions become involved?
