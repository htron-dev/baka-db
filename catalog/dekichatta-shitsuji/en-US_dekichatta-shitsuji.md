## Sinopse

"Your opponent: a BABY + Current state: a lot of PANIC = Result: a JOYOUS occasion!"

Konno Wataru, a rich son who is studious and quite prideful has a "butler." In charge of him is the domineering sadist Azuma, holding an official caretaker license and to top it all off, he's perverted. Amidst their instinctive cat & dog relationship, things get a bit risqué, during which Wataru's older sister's baby, Momoka, suddenly appears! With a MIA father, Momoka's care is left in their hands! In between the teasing, puzzled Wataru unexpectedly witnesses Azuma's sincerity…however…?!

A spin-off presented from the super popular "Dekichatta Danshi" featuring Yujiro & Hisui?
