    "sinopse": "Koya is the only son of the circus ringmaster. Growing up has proved difficult for him since he always got bullied for being a child of the circus, making him an introvert and labeled ‘boring’ by his peers. Now grown-up, he tries to land a decent job that does not involve the circus, with little luck.\n\nHaving no other options, Koya decides to work in the circus, with his dad being the current owner, as both assistant and janitor. There he meets the fellow workers, including the dazzling, though loud mouthed Suzuki, who too gets on Koya’s nerves from day one.\n\nAdding to that, it seems that the circus has budding relationships all around. But there is a slight problem: the circus has a love ban!\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
