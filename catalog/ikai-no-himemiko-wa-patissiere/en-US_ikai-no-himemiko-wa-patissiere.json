    "sinopse": "One day, Emi, an apprentice pâtissière, suddenly found herself in another world where evil spirits were abound. As she was about to be attacked by a beast, she was saved by a handsome knight. She makes some pudding to thank him, and by chance it was discovered that the sweets made by Emi were able to purify evil spirits! Dumbfounded by this, a shrine was set up in her name and she became known as the legendary purification princess?!\n\n(Source: AlphaPolis, translated)",
