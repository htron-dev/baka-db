## Sinopse

Ever since her childhood friend, Ryou, moved out of their small hometown, Seto Nagisa takes photos every day in the hopes of showing them when he returns as promised.

As she's taking a photo one day, she and her friends bump into the rising-actor, Kamijou Yamato, who has moved to the small town after some unsavory rumors began to spread about him in the entertainment world. Nagisa and Yamato immediately don't get along, but is it possible that they are actually becoming friends?
