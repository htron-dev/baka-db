## Sinopse

Those who doubt will receive punishment. A bright world about to be dyed in darkness.

A high school girl, with a cat in tow, suddenly appeared before the anime-loving college student Mayuzumi Asahi. What kind of disruptive daily life would the man-hating girl lead him to?

A strange juvenile tale of boy vs girl spectacularly starts!
