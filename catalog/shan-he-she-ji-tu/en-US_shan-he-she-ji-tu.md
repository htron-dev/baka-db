## Sinopse

If you could change the world, what would you do? And if you had the chance to change your life, would you?

There are two worlds that exist: reality; and a world that you think is reality. Da Wei is a young man who doesn’t care about anyone or anything aside from himself. However, when he finds out that his entire world is nothing more than an illusion and what’s more, it’s on the brink of collapse, will he make the decision to involve himself for the first time in something for the sake of others?
