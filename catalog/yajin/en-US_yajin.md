## Sinopse

Onda Iko, a solitary schoolgirl, can see ghosts. Which is somewhat annoying since one has been occupying her room for some time now and hindering her sleep. Things get even more complicated when she finds out two of her classmates can leave their bodies and wander around—a result of a mysterious online channel called 'The Night Ones'—and starts encountering more dangerous things than just pesky apparitions in her room.
