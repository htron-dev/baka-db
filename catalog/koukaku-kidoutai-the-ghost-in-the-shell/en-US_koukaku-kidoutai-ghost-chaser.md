## Sinopse

A new ride-like VR attraction. The ride will debut at the "hexaRide" attraction area of the renewed Diver City Tokyo Plaza. The ride attraction allows up to 12 people to ride at the same time using Q-Ride equipment with six-directional movement, and VR headsets. The ride costs 1,000 yen (about US$9) per person.

This story is set in the Kuzan Republic. The defense minister, who will take part in a meeting of the Next-generation Weapon Coordination Council, has ordered an advance onsite inspection.

Ride participants are tasked with providing escort while securing an inspection route in Public Security Section 9, where Motoko Kusanagi serves as leader.
Riders will use the hexaRide vehicle to enter cyberspace and, serving as a Public Security Section 9 agent, join in an attack on revolutionary movement forces.
