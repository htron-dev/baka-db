    "sinopse": "\"I am a human, but a doll...\nFeelings are not needed. Physically alive, but not mentally.\nI am a painting trapped inside rusted frame.\nThe cold skin of a statue.\nLife a stuffed bird-\nkilled and set for display\nI wonder...\nI wonder on whose display I will be put on...\"\n\nSuzette, a young girl, is regarded as a ‘living painting’ and comes from owner to owner. One day a young aristocrat, Ian McPolt buys her as a new item for his huge antics collection. But will Suzzete always be regarded as an item or will they develop some deeper feelings for each other?\n\n(Source: Esthétique and Osuwari Team)",
