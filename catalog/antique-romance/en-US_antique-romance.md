## Sinopse

"I am a human, but a doll...
Feelings are not needed. Physically alive, but not mentally.
I am a painting trapped inside rusted frame.
The cold skin of a statue.
Life a stuffed bird-
killed and set for display
I wonder...
I wonder on whose display I will be put on..."

Suzette, a young girl, is regarded as a ‘living painting’ and comes from owner to owner. One day a young aristocrat, Ian McPolt buys her as a new item for his huge antics collection. But will Suzzete always be regarded as an item or will they develop some deeper feelings for each other?
