## Sinopse

Follow the adventures of a punk girl with a pink gun as she rampages across the land. The word is out on the streets: a reward of five million dollars to the opportunist that wastes the courier calling herself Bambi and returns the kid called Bambi she leads around on a leash. Can Bambi's huge ego and formidable gun skills hold off an army?

Featuring awesome art by Kaneko Atsushi and a story that's hard-edged, fast paced and loaded with action, chaotic courier Bambi delivers the goods.
