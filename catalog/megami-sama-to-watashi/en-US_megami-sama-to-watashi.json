    "sinopse": "Lady Edith has a grandfather who is a mummy maniac and sponsored the ruin excavation at university, and a brother who studies Ancient Egypt at the university. But she hates archaeology because it's behind the times and absurd. The one day, she took in a kitten who was nearly dying and saved her from death. Edith's life changed in a major way after that...!? She can see lotus flowers sometimes and ancient Egyptian temples. Who is the goddess who calls her \"my priestess\" in her dreams?\n\n(Source: MU)",
