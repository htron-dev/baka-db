## Sinopse

Tong Tong (based on a real panda at Ueno Zoo of the same name who became the first giant panda to successfully be birthed in captivity Japan) and You You (Tong Tong's male sibling born 2 years after her) get scolded by Lion-sensei at school. At night a fire occurs due to a candle left lit and the fire brigade comes to put out the blaze. Tong Tong and You You learn about fire safety and the next day at school a blaze also occurs. The duo use their newly learnt knowledge and call 119 so that the fire brigade can come save their school.

This educational short was in part made in honor of the 20th anniversary of the "Normalization of the Sino-Japanese Relations" (1972) where pandas were temporarily exchanged.
