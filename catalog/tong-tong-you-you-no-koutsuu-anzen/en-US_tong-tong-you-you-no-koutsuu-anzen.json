    "sinopse": "Tong Tong (based on a real panda at Ueno Zoo of the same name who became the first giant panda to successfully be birthed in captivity Japan) and You You (Tong Tong's male sibling born 2 years after her) decide to go out of the house and into the city without their parents to meet their friend Mori (who is with his dad). They end up learning traffic safety from a helpful police woman who gets them to their destination safely.\n\nThis educational short was in part made in honor of the 20th anniversary of the \"Normalization of the Sino-Japanese Relations\" (1972) where pandas were temporarily exchanged.",
