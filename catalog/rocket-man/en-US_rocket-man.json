    "sinopse": "A jungle and war victims: these fragments constitute You Mizunashi's leftover memories. A doctor's son, You questions whether these pieces of his \"past\" aren't just constructs of a delusional mind. He forces himself to remember and in seeking his personal truth, alienates himself from his peers and presents school bullies with an easy target.\n\nOne day, while he is being harassed, a mysterious man—with a gaping wound on his abdomen—appears before You and his tormentors. You hastens to help the stranger and in return, learns that his unexpected patient goes simply by the name \"R\" and that R trades in secrets.\n\n(Source: MU)",
