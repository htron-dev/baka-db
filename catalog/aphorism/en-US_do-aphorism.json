    "sinopse": "Like the original manga, the new series centers on Naraka High School, a school that only admits students who can see an island in the sky. While it is allegedly a prestige school where graduates are guaranteed to get excellent government jobs, the students are forced to fight for survival in order to graduate.\n\nThe new main character is Hiroshi, a 15-year-old boy who can see the island in the sky. He and his friends enter the school as a test of courage but he alone returns.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
