    "sinopse": "Hewlett is a young, skilled artisan that makes unique clocks and watches. His creations have become fashionable as status symbols, but he isn't impressed by that. Hewlett wants to create clocks for people who will appreciate and treasure them. Overworked and weak-bodied, Hewlett often pushes his physical limits, which makes his butler, Jill, fret and worry. However, the mansion will be changing with the addition of a new maid, who is apparently a young girl that owns and treasures a very old piece made by Hewlett himself.\n\n(Source: shinkeikaku)",
