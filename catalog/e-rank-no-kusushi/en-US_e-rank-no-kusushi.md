## Sinopse

Despite how worthless Carol is as a healer, she is grateful for her adventuring party. Some may say they treat her poorly, constantly belittling her and demanding she do more; even so, Carol can't help but remain upbeat and loyal—that is until they throw her away.

Kicked out of her party and miles away from her small hometown, Carol has no means to return to her apothecary. As an E-rank healer, she stands no chance against wild monsters, and she has no funds to hire an escort. However, after she saves the life of S-rank magic swordsman Kaido, he offers to protect her on her way home.

As the pair start on their journey, they are faced with numerous instances where Carol's knowledge and skills are vital and surprisingly versatile. Impressed, Kaido invites Carol to join him; thus, the E-rank healer begins a journey once again!
