## Sinopse

Yato Tsurumi, a teacher at a preparatory school, has the ability to see the "ghosts of places." The afterimage of his old life with his missing lover, Kako, now stands in place of their house, which was washed away by a flood.

Tsurumi then finds himself in charge of a new student, Ima, who is burdened by her ability to hear the "sounds of the dead."
