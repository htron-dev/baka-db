Emotionally and physically intimate, they had the perfect relationship—until an argument tore them apart, promising to never see each other again.\n\nThree years later, Angelo is engaged to the wealthy daughter of a respectable family. In preparation for their wedding, he goes to meet with a novice caterer named Ellie Miliband—only to discover that Ellie is actually Francesca. Their breakup left behind painful memories, causing tensions to run high in the present; however, this may be their chance to rekindle a love that never died out completely.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
