## Sinopse

1-4) Oresama wo Kurae!
Asagami was kidnapped and found himself on board a yacht when he woke up. The one who appeared in front of him was his kouhai, once a beautiful and gentle angel, Fubuki.
“Senpai never came to look for me after graduation. So I want to make you mine even if I have to do it by force.” After saying that, Fubuki did everything he could. He’s so obsessed with Asagami and even put aphrodisiacs into his food. Will Asagami give in?

5. How to Raise a Boy
   Super elite secretary Sagaya has a clumsy side to him, and when he accidentally bumps into Haruna he feels guilty that the boy is fired. Taking the boy in is the least he can do, but his feelings for his adorable houseguest are getting more complicated by the second...

6. I Am Loved
   When his teacher/lover breaks up with him and gets transferred to another school, Takase doesn't give up, and secretly transfers too. Handsome student Tanoue is interested in Takase, but will he be able to capture Takase's heart away from sensei?
