## Sinopse

On the day of the school entrance ceremony, our protagonist gets carried off to the sick bay. In his feverish daze, he did not see the face of his benefactor. However, he is determined to find him to convey his thanks.

The other story has a main character who can see flower spirits. In fact, they appear every time he smiles. Tired of being thought weird for seemingly talking to air, he tries his best not to smile instead.
