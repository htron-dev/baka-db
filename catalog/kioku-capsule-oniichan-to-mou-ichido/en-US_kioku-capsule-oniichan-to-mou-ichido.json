When she wakes up in the hospital, she sees her mother and her big brother, who said her father remarried 2 years ago. Her brother says that whatever happens, he will stay close to Mayu. Her mother smiles kindly. Mayu's memories end at the point a new family is made... She wants to get back her lost memories. She wants to know, but it could be scary. This is what Mayu is told: \"Mayu, you and I had a romantic relationship.\" What will Mayu do, newly bewildered by her brother's shocking confession...!? A heart-wrenching, sensitive love story between a older brother and younger sister.\n\n(Source: Futabasha, translated)",
