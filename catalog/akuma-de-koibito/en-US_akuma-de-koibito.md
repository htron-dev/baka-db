## Sinopse

Ever since she was young, Rinko has always been labelled as a 'Ohito yoshi baka' by everyone except for a young boy, Itsuki. Since then, Rinko has always had strong feelings for Itsuki but will he ever be like that angel-like person she meet as a child or stay as the Akuma she has now gotten used to? (Source: Intercross)
