## Sinopse

I, who was hit by a truck in order to save a cat which turned out to be something really important, was transferred to another world as a reward. There, I chose to be a blacksmith. My family increased, I got dragged into incidents, and there's always a commotion, so in the end, can I really enjoy my slow life quietly?
