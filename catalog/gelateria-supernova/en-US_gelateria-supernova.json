    "sinopse": "Tomoaki randomly meets a guy through an online dating site, and they only know each other by their bland usernames. Their relationship consists of meeting at Supernova, the neighborhood gelato shop, and walking to Tomoaki's place to have sex...at least, it was supposed to. Tomoaki soon realizes his changing feelings and is worried he's the only one being drawn in deeper and deeper... Is he unable to resist these new emotions...? A sweet yet bitter tug-of-war between hearts revolves around this gelato shop.\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
