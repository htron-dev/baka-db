## Sinopse

After meeting through an online dating site, Naoki and Tomoaki had a purely physical relationship for almost a year before they finally became a proper couple. Tomoaki graduated from college and got a job, and despite their busy lives, the two men have slowly but surely grown closer together. However, when Tomoaki is sent to Osaka on a business trip, they're separated for two whole weeks. Having never spent this much time apart, it only takes a small thing to cause big trouble. Naoki's never loved anyone before, and he soon realizes he's getting a taste of something new. Feelings that began in a gelato shop melt together in sweet harmony and turn to love...
