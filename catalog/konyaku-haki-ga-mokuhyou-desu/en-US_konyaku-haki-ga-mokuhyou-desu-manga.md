Celenzia wakes up after a bump to the head with memories of her past life. She has lived a sheltered life as a high-born maiden. Armed with her previous memories and newfound, daring attitude, she manages to put an end to her engagement to her no-good, cheating fiance by catching him in the act. She's finally free, but now she has to deal with pretty-boy Albert getting involved in her affairs!? Celenzia intends to forge her own path and decide her own love life, but things don't end up going quite as planned!
