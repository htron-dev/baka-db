## Sinopse

After an accident, Celenzia wakes up to find that she can barely remember her current life in a fantasy kingdom. She only remembers her past life as a poor college student. And, somehow, the guy she wakes up next to is her fiance! None of it feels right. Her new life is so different from her old one, and she is constantly discovering fragments of her old personality coming back in every interaction...
