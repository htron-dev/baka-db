## Sinopse

The best stage for a thoroughbred to shine is a derby race. For young Hime and her jockey dad, the day of that derby race was supposed to be the best day of their lives. But during the race, her dad's thoroughbred was hit by another horse and after being thrown off, he was trampled to death. 10 years later, Hime is now a high schooler and has had nothing to do with horse racing ever since that fateful day. However, chance meetings with two guys are about to significantly draw her back in...?
