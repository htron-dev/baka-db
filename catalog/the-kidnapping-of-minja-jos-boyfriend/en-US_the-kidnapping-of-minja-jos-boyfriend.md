## Sinopse

This is actually a collection of short stories. The first one goes like this: Two high school girls are complete enemies, and they both are in their own gangs. They fight each other all the time, and to get even with the other, one girl tries to kidnap the other's boyfriend. But the information her right-hand girl gives her is wrong, and they kidnap some really good-looking guy who is NOT the boyfriend of the other girl. You know what happens. They fall in love.
