Laura was overflowing with joy when she became pregnant with her beloved Max's child. But then tragedy struck! Laura found out that her older sister was also pregnant with Max's child, even though she was married to his younger brother! The shock caused Laura to have a miscarriage, losing a precious life. Heartbroken, Laura moved by herself to London. Five years later, Max appeared before Laura once more. Her sister and her sister's husband had been arrested, and Max wanted her to take care of their two children!
