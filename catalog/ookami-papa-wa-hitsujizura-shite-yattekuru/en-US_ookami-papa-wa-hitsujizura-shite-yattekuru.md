## Sinopse

Hagiwara Tatsumi is given three tickets to a super hero show geared towards children from a client at his job. When he is complaining about the fact that he will never use them, he meets Maki Yuuto, who asks if he can take them for his son.Tatsumi admits he is gay, and only has one rule: Never fall for a man with a “home.” But then Tatsumi meets Maki Ritsu, Yuuto’s son and breaking his rule, by falling for a man with a home, seems like the most normal thing in the world.
