## Sinopse

Yura, who picks up his nephew on the way home from work, has a natural enemy: the blunt and unsociable preschool teacher Kaji. Despite his kindness for the children he teaches, Kaji hasn't a smile to spare for the guardians who come pick them up. Overlooked by the gay Yura, whom has a heart breaking history with his past boyfriend. When Yura's unrequited love silences him, calling him a "bastard homosexual" Kaji steps in to protect him, pretending to be his boyfriend?!

The love between an unsociable preschool teacher and a salaryman!
