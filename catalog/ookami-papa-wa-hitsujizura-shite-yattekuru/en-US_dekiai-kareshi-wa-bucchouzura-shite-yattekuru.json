    "sinopse": "Unsociable preschool teacher Kaji and salaryman Yura have been living together for half a year, filled with happiness and Kaji's unexpected smiles. But there's been a pleasant miscalculation of Kaji's monster strength when it comes to the bedroom. Yura makes the effort because \"I want to satisfy him too!\" but is unexpectedly rejected... Maybe he's getting tired of having sex with Yura?! Being happy but sometimes going through a rough patch—a sweet, sweet love story!\n\n(Source: Houbunsha, translated)",
