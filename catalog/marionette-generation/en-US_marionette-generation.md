## Sinopse

Despite the fact that lackadaisical illustrator Izumi Morino can't find work, his life is still very complicated. Cute junior-high-school student Kinoko has become his de facto assistant and is attempting to run his life through means of whining and wheedling. One morning, Kinoko catches him in bed with a doll - a cute rag doll. Embarassing to be sure, but even though Izumi had no idea where the doll came from, he could have handled the surprise...until the doll started to speak, walk, and call him nasty names!
