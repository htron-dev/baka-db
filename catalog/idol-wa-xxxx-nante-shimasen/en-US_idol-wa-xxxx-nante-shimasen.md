## Sinopse

Soujirou Yagi (23), an ordinary man in our modern society with nothing particularly special about him, is trapped in the mires of job-hunting failure, but believes that he has finally found salvation when he is offered a career as an illustrious Idol Manager.

However, it is soon evident that his new vocation is not the easy, clean and prettily sparkling Idol-Managing life he was hoping for, and the two girls he has been placed in charge of both conceal their own insurmountable and terrifying problems.

Between a girl who he can't hope to control and a girl who has no control, Soujirou Yagi (23), the unillustrious Idol Manager, comes to the grim and undeniable realization that if the three of them were to achieve any modicum of success, there are some sorts of things that idols definitely cannot do.
