## Sinopse

Prometheus was restrained in the Caucasus Mountains and continues to be tortured for 30,000 years to pay for his unforgivable sin of giving fire to humanity. During the day, the eagle devours his liver. And at night, Zeus punishes him by making him solve humanity's cold cases of history—an unbearable predicament for someone who loves the human race.
