It is a time of chaos. Earth is no longer what it used to be. It has been infested with a bug like species called the Blue. 20 years ago Yuji Kaido, who has a mysterious disease, is put into suspended animation until a cure is found. When he wakes up Yuji learns that itâ€™s been more than 20 years since he was put into suspended animation, and the world is now controlled by these creatures.
