## Sinopse

Ririka is an average student that can, in fact, transform into "Nurse Angel" by using a special nurse-like hat given to her by her senpai Kanou (who is, in fact, from another dimension/world connected to this one). Ririka's fellow classmate and neighbor is Seiya, who follows her and helps her as much as he can. Aside beating evil monsters.
