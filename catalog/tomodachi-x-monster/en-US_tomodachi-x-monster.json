    "sinopse": "In a small mountainous village in rural Japan, strange creatures lurk. It's here that young Wataru hears a voice calling out to him. Wandering from his school, he soon discovers a new \"friend\" that will transform his life forever―or drastically shorten it. Wataru learns of a hidden world of monsters who seek to befriend young children, and together with them enter a horrifying death match. Watch what really happens when kids with no conscience get hold of monstrous friends to do their bidding.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas)",
