1-3) Is it wrong to eye your body?
"As long as Kakuno's willing to look at me, it's okay." Hazumi was helped by his classmate, Kakuno, who saw him being harassed by some upperclassmen. His heart stolen by Kakuno's strong and beautiful body, Hazumi told Kakuno that he wanted to see it all. Kakuno obliged, but as time passed their relationship became no clearer. They started out as strangers, neither lovers nor friends. Which would it be, if any?
