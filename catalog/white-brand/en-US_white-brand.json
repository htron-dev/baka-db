Ever since his father died saving him, Asano has associated his father's white ashes with purity and cleanliness. Unfortunately, for his dark-complected cousin Izuru, Asano's neurosis prevents them from being close. Will Asano learn to overcome his distaste for things that are not pure white for Izuru's sake? Includes three other stories.",
