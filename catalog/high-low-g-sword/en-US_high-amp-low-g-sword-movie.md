## Sinopse

High & Low: G-Sword manner movies that aired in theaters before main features in part promote the live-action "HiGH&LOW The Movie 2: End of Sky" film that opened August 19, 2017. Each episode stars a different G-Sword gang member. In the shorts, the characters are at a theater in the Sword district and they interact with one another and the camera-headed man known as Movie Thief (Eiga Dorobou), a stand-in character used to represent piracy. The commercials will rotate out at the end of each week.
