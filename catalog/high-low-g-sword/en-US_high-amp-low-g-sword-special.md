## Sinopse

HiGH&LOW THE LAND was a limited time theme park section at Yomiuri Land. The event space recreated scenery from High & Low: G-Sword where guests could buy goods, ride coasters, and watch live performers reenact scenes. Starting in July, five brand-new shorts were to be shown at the theme park each day of the week. They ran all the way till the section closed on September 10, 2017.
