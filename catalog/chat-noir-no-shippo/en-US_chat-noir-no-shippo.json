But their mother's death isn't the only disaster that happened in that restaurant - for example, there's a thief who comes all the time, but never steals anything. Then one day, a man helped them chase out a client who was picking a fight. They let him lodge in their house as a token of gratitude, but he is a mysterious man with unclear past who never talks much about anything..!?\n\nContents:\nChat Noir no shippo\nBreath of the crescent moon\nGemini",
