    "sinopse": "Since the end of World War II, rumors of a mysterious assassin that even the Yakuza are afraid of, have long struck fear throughout Tokyo's underworld. According to legend, this assassin moonlights as a Ramen street vendor, and is willing to take out his targets for the super low fee of 500 yen—the price of a bowl of his legendary \"Tenchuu Ramen.\" With the war being so long ago though, could it just be an old legend, or has this assassin passed down his art to a younger generation...?\n\n(Source: MU)",
