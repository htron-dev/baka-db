## Sinopse

Kouki has found himself reborn, together with many of his past-life memories, in an alternate version of Japan. "There are no magic or elves?! Then what's the point of being reborn in another world?"

It seems a little disappointing at first, but somehow his childhood sketches inspire his mother to develop a revolutionary new theory that changes the world forever. This sets into motion a series of misunderstandings that has everyone believing that Kouki is the real genius behind all of the incredible new technology that his mother is rapidly developing. As a result of his apparent genius, Kouki is forced to give up on his peaceful school life and have to attend the International Science and Technology Academy, where he meets a beautiful Canadian girl, Alice Alford, a robotics engineer named Shingo Saitou, and an expert on space exploration, Megumi Aikawa. Surely, he can't still continue being mistaken for a genius while surrounded by these real geniuses?! Every time Kouki uses his knowledge from his past life, it causes a new misunderstanding, and his ordinary life is gradually turning into an extraordinary life. Kouki can't help but go from one misunderstanding to another in this insane sci-fi comedy!!
