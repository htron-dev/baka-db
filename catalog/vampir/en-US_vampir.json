    "sinopse": "He died, only for a minute. Minakawa Ryo was an ordinary high school student until the day a girl jumped off a building, killing him with her. He miraculously comes back to life but with a new ability to see and hear what ordinary people cannot. Then one day a mysterious girl, Hokuto Shou, appears and tells him that his half has become a resident of the world of the dead. His previous ordinary life has dissipated, and a new life between the \"living\" and the \"dead\" begins.\n\n(Source: MU)",
