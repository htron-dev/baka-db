The younger sons are unemployed and looking for ways to fill their time. This is the story of a younger son, Fujimi Kikinosuke, as he spends his days getting into all kinds of wild situations. He spends a lot of time with his friend Juuzou, and he soon meets a new friend, a young aspiring female artist, Uta, who has her own share of troubles.\n\n(Source: MU)",
