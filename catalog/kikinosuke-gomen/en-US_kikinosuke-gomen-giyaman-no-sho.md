## Sinopse

During the middle of the Edo period, there was a long reign of peace in which no one died in a conflict. But being born into a samurai family, there could be only one successor to the house, hence, the second and third sons of the family were busy looking for work. This is the story of Kikinosuke Fujimi, second son to the Fujimi family.
