## Sinopse

This story takes place during a long stretch of peace during the Edo period. For samurai families, only the eldest son inherits the house. The younger sons are unemployed and looking for ways to fill their time. This is the story of a younger son, Fujimi Kikinosuke, as he spends his days getting into all kinds of wild situations. He spends a lot of time with his friend Juuzou, and he soon meets a new friend, a young aspiring female artist, Uta, who has her own share of troubles.
