    "sinopse": "Her dad remarried, and has moved Hinageshi from the city to the country side village of Ogawara, where agriculture is very abundant. As a new member of the Nozawa family, she learns the ins and outs of farming which Hinageshi finds exciting. But what is more incredible is having new sisters in her life. Yashiro is the oldest, beautiful and seems innocent but has a wild side to her. Mayu is vibrant and vocal but is scared to death of insects. Ringo is the youngest but by far the brains of the group and is an encyclopedia of important and sometimes unimportant information. Their sisterly bonds are still little saplings but with each day passing it becomes stronger.\n\n(Source: MU)",
