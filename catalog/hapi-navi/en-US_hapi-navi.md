Chiharu is a young woman just starting her job-search lifestyle, in the field of mass communications. Things are starting off well, and she gets an internship with a TV station to gain some job experience. Some of her friends from the university choir club are also following the same path, and she is also meeting new friends, such as a young man named Taiga. This stage of her life is going to be challenging, but hopefully Chiharu will make it through!
