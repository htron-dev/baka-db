    "sinopse": "Jinno Shizuku has been admitted to a special school that fosters teenagers with magic powers, such as elemental manipulation, teleportation, and telepathy. His roommate is one of the popular twins, Celes and Misty. They're special students known as \"Children of God\" due to their strong powers. They suspect a strong power also lies within Shizuku and readily latch onto him. Is Shizuku also a Child of God?\n\n(Source: shinkeikaku)",
