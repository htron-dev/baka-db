## Sinopse

Yuki Miyama is an up-and-coming young star. He has always adored Masataka Kitamura, a modern-day Valentino, and is excited to have the chance to work with the older actor, who ends the session by snorting at his performance. To make matters worse, Yuki gets totally smashed after Masataka toys with him over drinks. The next thing he knows, he's lying in bed... with Masataka!

A love story about a naïve model who is swayed every which way by a hot, mysterious actor!
