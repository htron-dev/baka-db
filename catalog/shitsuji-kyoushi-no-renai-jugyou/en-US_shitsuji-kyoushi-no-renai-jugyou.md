## Sinopse

"I’ve saved myself for you because you’re my only master for life!"

Sera was acting out his rebellion against his parents, when Makieda, a former butler, came into the picture as a substitute teacher.

Under Makieda’s guidance, Sera learned more than just becoming a gentleman. He also fell in love with this butler-turned-instructor. However, will Makieda choose duty to serve his former master over love…? See how these two struggle to master the lesson of love.

Also collected in the book, “Social Dance for Men!” Being allergic to girls, Misumi had no chance of entering a social dance competition… unless he could find a man for a partner. However, Misumi never expected his four-eyed male partner would switch personality once his glasses were removed.
