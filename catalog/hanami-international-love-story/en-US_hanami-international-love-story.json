But after floating home on cloud nine, he found . . . his family packing up to move to Seoul?!\n\nNow tossed into a big new city and lovesick for the girl still in Suwon, Joonho runs into weird characters at every turn.

She's okay, but Joonho might not be once her massive grandfather shows up and thinks he's to blame!\n\nHanami's sweet nature quickly charms Joonho, and he discovers that his new school, including a self-styled blonde Casanova, is already abuzz over his cute Japanese neighbor. But what about Sae-un? And what on earth is the Babe Patrol Research Center?! Discover a completely entertaining read and one of the most popular comics Korea has to offer.
