## Sinopse

One day, Take came home tired from work to find his son left alone crying in the dark. His wife had ran away and Take had become a single father who had to take care of his son, Kota all by himself. After Kota started nursery school, it turned out that one of the teachers there is Aoto, a kid that Take used to bully in school. Take has become estranged from his friends after his son was born and he has his hands full with both work and childrearing. When he unexpectedly showed his weak side to Aoto, Aoto hugged him and comforted him saying, "You're giving your best and that's very admirable." After that, Take has started becoming conscious of Aoto...?
