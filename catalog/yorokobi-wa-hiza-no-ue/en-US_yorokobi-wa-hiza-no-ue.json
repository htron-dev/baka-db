Mitsuru looked totally different from Orito’s impression of him. Mitsuru suddenly kissed Orito and asked Orito to keep his visit to the pub a secret from Yuzuru. It turned out that their feelings for each other was mutual. But because the brothers were really close, so out of jealousy, Orito told Yuzuru about it. Would the brothers forgive Orito?\n(Source: MU)",
