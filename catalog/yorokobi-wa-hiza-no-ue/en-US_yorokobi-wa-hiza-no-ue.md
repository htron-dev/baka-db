## Sinopse

Orito Kouki was working in his mother’s pub and saw an unexpected customer, Mitsuru. Mitsuru was the elder brother of his college friend, Yuzuru. Mitsuru looked totally different from Orito’s impression of him. Mitsuru suddenly kissed Orito and asked Orito to keep his visit to the pub a secret from Yuzuru. It turned out that their feelings for each other was mutual. But because the brothers were really close, so out of jealousy, Orito told Yuzuru about it. Would the brothers forgive Orito?
