While not so much in particularly willing to go about aggressively capturing monsters or aim to be the strongest player. Just wanting to have an adventure to search for cute monsters and clothes' material. Without noticing in the flow of one situation after another, he becomes the top ranking Summoner.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
