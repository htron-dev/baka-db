## Sinopse

Even with his hot career, a top movie star Eunhee finds his life empty with no specific reason. Then one day, in front of his door, he finds Gain who looks like an abandoned cat from a bad mugging incident. After that day, the two men get to share Eunhee's house... and his bed, though not intended. Eunhee gradually realizes that his hopeless and meaningless life has changed forever since Gain has entered his house, and his love for the boy storms up his heart and changes him altogether.
