    "sinopse": "Otomura may look scary with his tattoo and bleached blond hair but when he saves fellow college student Satori from an aggressive crow, Satori discovers that looks can be deceptive. The more he learns about Otomura, the more Satori likes his new friend, but getting his classmates to understand what he sees in this dangerous looking guy may bring more misunderstandings than enlightenment...unless you have a pushy crow on your side....\n\n(Source: MU)",
