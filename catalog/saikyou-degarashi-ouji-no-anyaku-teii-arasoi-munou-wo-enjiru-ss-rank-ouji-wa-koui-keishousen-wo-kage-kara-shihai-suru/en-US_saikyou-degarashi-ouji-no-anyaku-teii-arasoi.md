## Sinopse

The Adrasia empire on the Vogel continent. With the successor of the empire left undecided, the children of the emperor are vying to expand their power. However, there was one prince that everyone says will definitely not become the emperor.

The seventh prince, Arnold Lakes Adler. The young man who was inferior to his younger twin brother in every way, the dull prince. Incompetent and lethargic, Arnold wastes everyday just playing around. However, behind the scenes, he is one of the only five SS-Class adventurers called "Silver."

Seeing the intensifying battle for the throne he decided "I don't want to die so let's have my little brother become the emperor..."

This is the tale of absurd secret maneuvers of the prince who is uninterested in the title of the emperor.
