## Sinopse

Sitting at the back of a small residential street, Café Cappuccino is often in need of new employees due to its previous part-time staff quitting their jobs one by one. The café is not a bad place to work nor is the owner a horrible boss; rather, the girls employed there entered romantic relationships soon after drinking a cup of the café's signature cappuccino, and they moved on without regrets. It is rumored that the coffee brewed by the owner contains an aphrodisiac that attracts lovers—famous ones, at that, such as models, actors, or company presidents.
