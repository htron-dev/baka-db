## Sinopse

Dr. Ramon Cortero's patient, Nurse Noreen Kensington, has a serious case of heartache. Maybe the only remedy is a dose of old-fashioned tender loving care from the seductive doctor! But Ramon's stormy history with Noreen made him the one man she didn't want rescuing her now that she was ill.

When truths about the past are revealed, Ramon is determined to make things right with the woman who's haunted his dreams for so long. But will this patient doctor be able to mend Noreen's broken heart before it's too late?
