But Ramon's stormy history with Noreen made him the one man she didn't want rescuing her now that she was ill.\n\nWhen truths about the past are revealed, Ramon is determined to make things right with the woman who's haunted his dreams for so long. But will this patient doctor be able to mend Noreen's broken heart before it's too late?",
