## Sinopse

Left to himself at an early age in the slummiest parts of today’s Japan, Kiichi learns how to survive on his own. As a teenager, how can he adapt to a society whose rules he rejects? Unless he creates his own rules… Kiichi, a raw icon of strength and integrity, stands alone against the world’s injustice and becomes an unforgettable character.
