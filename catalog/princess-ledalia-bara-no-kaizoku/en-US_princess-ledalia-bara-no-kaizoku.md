## Sinopse

Sailing aboard her bosom friend Dret's pirate ship, Ledalia had only known a pirate's life all her 14 years, until the day they arrived upon the shores of Valencia. Tragedy strikes when Ledalia's trusted guardian Vector is killed by refugee hunters. With his dying breath, he reveals to Ledalia that she is actually a true-blooded princess of a country known as Mesaleena, which was laid ruin by Valencia's Illilian army, and that she had a twin brother that was locked away in a hidden tower! Angered and fueled by her lust for adventure, Ledalia begins her quest to save her brother and reclaim her birth right!
