## Sinopse

This concerns the strange dorm for employees who specialize in demon exorcisms, "Kamikakushi". One of its tenants, Chiyaki, the moment he meets a new tenant, Jyanome, is given the ardent confession, "I've fallen for you._heart_", and it's a huge inconvenience! Ghost incidents are his specialty. But this time his opponent is a little more complicated?! Here follows a bizarre tale of one man with an abundance of individuality, and his stream of difficult clients and their troubles!
