## Sinopse

Satoru spends his days listlessly in a factory town. The old man Segawa, a former Yakuza, lives in the room next to his cheap apartment. One day, Segawa asks Satoru to kill him for a 5 million yen, but Satoru hesitates, and Segawa sees through to the madness eating away inside him and begins to have a change of heart, and yet...!?

A story of the filth of society and the dark path that Satoru takes, on the edge of sanity, with a gun and 5 million yen.
