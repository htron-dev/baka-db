    "sinopse": "\"I'm gonna change my life!\" Yuuta, who failed at his job hunting, went to local tattoo shop on impulse with such determination. There, he met a blonde guy with piercing named Atsushi. On their first meeting, Atsushi confessed he fell in love with Yuuta at the first sight! Although Atsushi is a good looking man, skilled at sex and seems like a fun person, while embracing Yuuta, he said, \"It's fine if Yuu-kun is the only person by my side.\" Because of that, they began to live under the same roof. But Atsushi always keep his eyes on Yuuta 24/7, and that is to show his possessiveness?!\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Kimi to Mou Ichido Koi wo",
