## Sinopse

Momoko Nanase wants to be an illustrator, so it is unclear why she remains at a company that designs materials for pachinko parlors. The work is difficult and unrelated to her aspirations, assignments accumulate quickly, her coworkers range from the eccentric to the perverted, and all-nighters are common if not mandatory.

The only times Momoko sees her boyfriend are when she sleeps over at his apartment, leading them to gradually grow apart. He and Momoko's female friends urge her to quit while she is still new and not yet burnt out. But despite having written a resignation letter, she keeps it in her desk drawer and is hesitant to turn it in.

One night, Momoko has a rooftop encounter with Masashi Tagaya, who works on the same floor in their building. She confides in him about her intention to quit, only to be told that the people who say that usually end up staying until the end. As time passes, Momoko questions if and when she should leave, as well as whether she wants to know Tagaya better.
