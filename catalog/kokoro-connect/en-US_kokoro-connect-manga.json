While they seem as close as friends can be, when they mysteriously start swapping bodies with one another, their bond is put to the test. Now the five friends must figure out not only why this is happening to them, but come to terms with each other's innermost secrets, fears, and hidden crushes. Can they possibly stay friends while retaining their sanity?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
