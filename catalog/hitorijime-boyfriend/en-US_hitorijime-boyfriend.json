    "sinopse": "\"Would you like to break up with me again or be held, which would you prefer?\" My former friend with the beautiful face, whom I've run into again after so long, only says things that cause me trouble. In the winter of sixth grade, Kensuke was upset about having to separate from his best friend Hasekura in middle school, and ended up breaking off their friendship.
