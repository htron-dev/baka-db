## Sinopse

There is said to be an ancient power that lies dormant deep within Earth. It took the shape of an ape but it was much more than that. Physically strong and psychologically powerful, nothing stood in its way. However, one day, this godlike being split into two: the physical part and the mental state. While the power of the physical part grew larger and larger, the mental part spread its energy throughout the planet into humans.

Now, people using black magic are killing those with the spirit in them because as the mental part becomes weaker, the physical side becomes stronger, strong enough to destroy the planet. Elaine Beaulieu was one of those with the mental side inside her and when she was near death, the monkey spirit took over, trying to protect itself. Candid Amantini was sent from the Vatican as an exorcist specialist and learns the truth about the omnipotent ape monster. A Japanese girl named Nana and Nawan Namugyaru, a man who has lost his memory, gets involved in the movement to stop those using black magic from resurrecting the ancient power and destroying Earth.
