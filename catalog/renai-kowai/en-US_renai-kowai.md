## Sinopse

This manga features the daily life of the workers at a video/CD rental shop. Sakurai Kyousuke is a college student who is interested in a younger worker, Doumoto Haruka. Haruka is a cute high school girl who has a boy's personality, including an intense interest in other cute girls. Working with both of them is also the lovely Hasekura Ryoko, a pretty 20-year-old with a great rack and personality. Other people also come into the picture as they continue their everyday life of working at the rental shop!
