## Sinopse

For beach bum Horyu, it’s more than the surf that’s up. He has just confessed his undying love to the timid and quiet Shouin. Though Shouin feels the same, he is reluctant to return Horyu’s affections. Unknown to Horyu, Shouin already had his heart broken and is – as the saying goes – once bitten, twice shy. It looks like Horyu will wipe out on this one, unless he can convince Shouin that he won’t ever go through the same heartache twice.
