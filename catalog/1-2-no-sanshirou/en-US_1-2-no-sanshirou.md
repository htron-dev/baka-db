## Sinopse

Shino Houjou is running very late for her first day at a new high school she's transferred to, when she runs smack dab into Sanshirou, a big young man who is just as late if not even more so. It's not his fault that they've crashed into one another, but Shino is a bit of a crybaby and it doesn't get any better. Sanshirou is assigned to Shino to show her the ropes, something they both dread. Then things change as Shino sees the Rugby team in action and discovers that Sanshirou is being actively recruited by every "manly" sport in the school—all of which he excels at and none of which interest him.
