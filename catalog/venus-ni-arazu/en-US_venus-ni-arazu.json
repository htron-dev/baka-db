    "sinopse": "Miyoshi Yoshiko is working her way as a model by doing various modeling gigs for her agency. After one of those gigs causes her to lose her job as a model, she now faces a desperate situation of being broke and unemployed. Things start to look up when she gets offered another modeling job, but this time it's modeling for Chuujou Tarou, the lecherous sculptor who got her fired in the first place! How will Yoshiko handle working for a perverted employer who can't keep his hands off her–not because he's attracted to her, but because he likes her bone structure?!\n\n(Source: Aerandria Scans)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Blanc Marié\nVolume 2: Biyaku (Aphrodisiac)",
