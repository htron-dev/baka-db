    "sinopse": "After bickering on an internet site, Han YaeWon is trying to escape from the popular but scary Ji EunSong getting back at her... and then she accidentally kisses him while falling on top of him. EunSong demands that she take responsibility by dating him (marrying him, to be exact) because he has never held a girl's hand, much less kissed one, if he isn't going to marry the girl. At first, YaeWon thinks he's a huge jerk, but as she gets to know him more, she finds out that maybe all EunSong needs is somebody who genuinely cares about him...\n\n(Source: MU)",
