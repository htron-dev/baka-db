## Sinopse

Jim is a young boy bound by a curse which seals him in the darkness of purgatory for 100 years. Bound by a curse, half of his heart is held by his best friend Luca. Due to Luca's betrayal, Jim lost both his "best friend" and his "heart." Once every 100 years, Jim is allowed to roam free for only 10 days and search for Luca whom he must defeat! Hatred replaces friendship and friends become enemies, now, who will be the one left alive?
