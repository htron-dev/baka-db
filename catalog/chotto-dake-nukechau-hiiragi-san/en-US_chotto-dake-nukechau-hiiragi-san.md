## Sinopse

Kotori-kun, who falls in love with his classmate Hiiragi-san at first sight, somehow wants to get close to her. Hiiragi-san is quite an earnest and lovely girl, but... She's surprisingly a little careless! This is about the charming school life of a careless girl and a pure boy who gets led on everyday by her.
