Meet Kirby! He is round and pink, ever so mischievous and is always up for a snack. Follow the adventures of Dream Land's zany cast of characters and their most awesome resident, Kirby.

Kirby and his friend, Chirby, are on a quest to return the Star Rod, the legendary treasure of Dream Land. But thing aren't so easy as King Dedede wants the Star Rod all for himself. Will Kirby be able to stop thinking about food long enough to defeat King Dedede's dastardly plan and get the Star Rod back where it belongs?
