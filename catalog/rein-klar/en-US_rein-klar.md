## Sinopse

In the future, technology has advanced to the point that robots are capable of replacing humans in many jobs, fostering resentment in many people.

Sakuya is a young man that hates robots and how they steal jobs from honest working people. He is resourceful himself and makes a living by running a junk and salvage shop. One day, Sakuya visits the site of a recently destroyed research facility to look for parts. Instead, he finds a robot in the rubble. The robot awakened here with no memory, mission, or purpose. Sakuya is taken aback by the robot because it appears incredibly human-like, unlike any other robot he's ever seen. The robot is visibly upset and lost with no purpose, so Sakuya simply tells it to decide for itself, like a human. The robot, Haku, decides to follow Sakuya and make itself useful to him.
