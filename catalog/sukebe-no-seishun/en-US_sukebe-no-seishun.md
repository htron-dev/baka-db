## Sinopse

Mitamura, who is a virgin, has a personal view about "lewd." He also realizes a friend in the same class, Hayami, never takes off his clothes in public. A person who is good looking and excels in studies and sports, just like the male lead from a shoujo manga, why doesn't he take off his clothes? What in the world is Hayami hiding...? And why am I getting excited about it...? His hands move with confusion and desire, making a lewd (erotic) photo of Hayami. However, Hayami's secret has been found out?
