    "sinopse": "Kagura is a professional slacker with nothing put a part-time job and cram school to keep him company. When a little girl suddenly shows up in his house one day, he thinks things can't get any weirder...until she starts calling him \"Daddy\"! It’s hard enough taking care of an ordinary child, but Kanna—who doesn’t speak his language, isn’t from his dimension, and has hordes of evil minions hot on her heels—is anything but ordinary!\n\n(Source: Go!
