## Sinopse

The story starts with the heroine, Pieta, being asked "How long are you going to keep singing in the same rain?" by a girl in the pouring rain. Pieta leaves the house on her birthday thinking "It's going to be a good day," but her uniform gets dirty with muddy water from a car and her umbrella is blown away by the wind. However, as if she knew that misfortunes would hit her, she was ready to solve the problem of dirty clothes and lost umbrellas. The story gets going when Pieta returns home at the end of the day, and wakes up after going to bed.
