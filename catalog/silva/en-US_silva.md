## Sinopse

A happy-go-lucky girl named Silva wielding a scythe and claiming to be part of an evil organization transfers into a normal high school. She befriends her classmates, skirmishes with the heroes of justice, and helps to recruit new members into her organization. It's a comedy full of good and evil (which is which is sometimes difficult to tell), dubious magical girls, hopeless adults, and pudding.
