## Sinopse

Although she never asked for it, 27-year-old So Yeori possesses the extraordinary ability to communicate with ghosts. She has always considered it a burden rather than a gift and always passes spirits without a single glance. When she moves into a new house, Yeori resolves to ignore the resident ghost. However, he has a different idea.

Even when he was alive, Go Joon yearned for the comfort of living together with someone, and his untimely death three years ago only exacerbated his pain. He wants nothing more than to talk to someone, for Yeori to stay; and reluctantly, she agrees to live with him for a year. As two people who have always been alone, Yeori and Joon must now face the joys and hardships of the cohabitation between human and ghost.
