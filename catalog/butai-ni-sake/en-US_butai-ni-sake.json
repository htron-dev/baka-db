    "sinopse": "Oniwa Asahi's just starting his high school life, and he's decided it's time to turn over a new leaf and learn how to make friends and get to know those around him. How does someone who's terrible at interacting with other people go about doing that, though? Turns out, it's as easy as joining the Theatre Club and its quirky cast of characters, including the captain Imari, who seems to have his own issues opening up to others.\n\n(Source: September Scanlations)",
