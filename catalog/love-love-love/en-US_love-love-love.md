"I have to keep moving forward!"

Nonomiya Akane, 17 years old, second year in high school and the eldest daughter of the owner of Yaohachi Greengrocer, lives her life according to that motto. So when her crush for the past seven years, Nakai Sachio, announces that he was going out with childhood friend, Nishii Kayomi, Akane decides to just forget and move forward.

Whether she fights with Yamato, her childhood friend, or suffers a heartbreak, she doesn't falter and keeps working hard to achieve her dreams.

So what kind of miracles will Akane be given?
