## Sinopse

Set in an alternative catfolk-inhabited post-war Japan, occupied and integrated into the Soviet Union, this is a story about a traveling goze—a blind female musician—and a skilled swordsman Youme, and her guide, buddhist monk Uguisu. Making a living with street performances and taking on dangerous jobs that make use of their considerable fighting expertise, the pair clashes swords with criminals, Cheka enforcers and orthodox religious sects looking for clues to the whereabouts of Uguisu's brother and the mysterious two-tailed Cheka operative.
