## Sinopse

Kamio Shuuji, the heir to a rich organization, has just transferred to Hazuki's average public high school. When Kamio catches Hazuki's eye with an intense gaze Hazuki begins to wonder over his attentions. Especially when Akira, his lover, warns him to stay away from him. He intends to do just that, that is until Kamio claims to have fallen in love at first sight with Hazuki, giving him a kiss to seal the deal. But what exactly are Kamio's intentions? And why has Akira warned him against the heir in the first place?
