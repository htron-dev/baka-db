    "sinopse": "The title \"Yuu & Mii\" is a pun on the English phrase \"You and Me\". Aimu Yuu (remark: his name sounds like \"I'm you\") is a boy who just moved into the equivalent of a boarding house.\n\nEverything is not as it first seems, even the boy. Living in the same room is a ghost named Mii. The series is a combination of love, humour, and a general parody of anime and manga. There are a lot of weird characters in this manga.\n\n(Source: MU)",
