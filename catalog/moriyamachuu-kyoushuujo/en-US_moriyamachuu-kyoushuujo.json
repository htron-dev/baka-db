    "sinopse": "The manga centers on Kiyotaka Saitou—an apathetic college student who does things at his own pace—and Todoroki, a poker-faced cool yakuza member. Kiyotaka and Todoroki were classmates in high school, and both men attend an unofficial driving school one summer thanks to a certain incident.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
