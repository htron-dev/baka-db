One thing though: she can't use modern technology inside the house whatsoever?! Which means no vacuums, no cellphones, no laptops, etc. What is up with her twisted, but handsome, employer Asakura Shiyuusei-san? And what exactly is he hiding in his storage room...?\n\n(Source: Heroines of Fantasia)",
