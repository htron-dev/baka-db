## Sinopse

Ruku Minatomachi is a 15-year-old high school student from Yokohama. Her dream is to travel the world to eat delicious gourmet food. Upon being told by her parents that she's actually a highly efficient, time-traveling android, Ruku embarks on an adventure, traveling back to the Taisho Era (1912–1926) to search for her grandfather. She meets Oni-san upon her arrival and is whisked away to his domain.
