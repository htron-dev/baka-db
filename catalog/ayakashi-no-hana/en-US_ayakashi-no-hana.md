## Sinopse

Welcome to the darkness of Tokyo!

A little crook named Yoshiki is about to be killed for an assault on Yakuza's wife. He owes his salvation only to the intervention of a mysterious woman as beautiful as dangerous. At the same time, the police discover a body with a frozen face, a gaping wound in the neck and drained of all blood. The inspectors carry out the investigation and link this crime to an old case... before being attacked by demonic beings!
