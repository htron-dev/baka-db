## Sinopse

This is the story of Kai—the eldest brother in the Nekoya family who fell in love at first sight with Kyousuke Suzuki. Kyou-chan and Kai are university classmates, and Kai is constantly confessing to Kyou-chan, but is always rejected. So, how far will this love affair of a sensitive brother from the Nekoya family go? Will "beauty" Kyou-chan accept the affection of this frail brother?
