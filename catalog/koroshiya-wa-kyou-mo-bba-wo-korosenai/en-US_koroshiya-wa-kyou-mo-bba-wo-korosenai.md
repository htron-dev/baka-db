## Sinopse

Makoto Nozawa, 77 years old. Lives alone. Favourite food: curry. Just your standard, slightly eccentric old woman... Except for the fact that she's targeted by assassins everyday. And everyday, she gives it back to them threefold.

A humorous action story about the strongest old woman in history.
