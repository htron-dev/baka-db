Naruse plays games almost all the time, getting him in trouble at his private school and worrying his childhood friend Hoju. He's incredibly good at war games because he is good at reading his opponents.\n\nOne day, he ends up downloading a strange game called \"Revolt\" onto his phone. It's a game that has him orchestrate a revolution, and the graphics seem incredibly life-like. At the end, he learns that he was actually giving real-world orders, and that the game was part of a scouting process for a company that helps to run revolutions. Now they want him to be their commander and help them save the world!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
