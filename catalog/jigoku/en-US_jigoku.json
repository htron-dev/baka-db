    "sinopse": "Weird, tripped-out collection of one-shots. Subtly twisted, delicately detailed but with a strong line, with elongated bodies and shades of Art Deco. Somewhat reminiscent of both Gorey and Dali by way of Edvard Munch, but the style is unique and distinctive and very much the artist's own. About as far as you can get from manga and still be in the same country.",
