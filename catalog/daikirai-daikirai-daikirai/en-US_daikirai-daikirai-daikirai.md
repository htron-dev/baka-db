## Sinopse

High school student Kou has been called a Shinigami ever since three continuous deaths happened to those important to him: his mother died giving birth to him, his father died protecting him and his lover died rescuing him. Due to these deaths, Kou now believes that anyone loved by a Shinigami...dies.
