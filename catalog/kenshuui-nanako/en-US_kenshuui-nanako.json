    "sinopse": "After graduation, doctor-in-training Nanako Sugisaka is starting her residency, along with a group of her classmates. They are all in that awkward period where they have their degrees, but they don't yet have enough experience to be really useful around the hospital. Nanako also has to deal with people underestimating her (or even refusing to accept that she is a doctor!), due to her age, gender and physical attractiveness. Nanako and the others observe their assigned mentor doctors, and begin to shed their inexperience by performing tasks under supervision. They will work hard to become the best doctors they can be.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
