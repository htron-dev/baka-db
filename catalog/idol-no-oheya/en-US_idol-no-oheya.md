## Sinopse

Actresses, musicians, and models. A scary old man has wandered into the secret garden of the stars of tomorrow?! Kazutora Mayama, the man who was once called the fighting tiger, has accepted the job of becoming a live-in building superintendent at a talent agency's staff dorm. This is the slapstick story of a super who oozes manhood, and the delicate flowers that surround him.
