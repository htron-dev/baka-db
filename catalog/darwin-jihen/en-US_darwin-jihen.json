That chimpanzee gave birth to a \"humanzee\" (half-human, half-chimpanzee) who was named Charlie. After being raised by human parents for fifteen years, Charlie enters his first year of high school. There, he meets the intelligent, but socially misunderstood Lucy.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
