## Sinopse

When earthquakes and lightning spook Kouyoh, Issei steps in to comfort him. But even after cementing their relationship, Issei is met with many rejections and even violence from his new lover, who is quick to fight and quite shy in matters of love. And is all really safe, especially when Kouyoh, Issei and the suspicious Mutsuki all live under the same roof? Not to mention the appearance of a potential rival for Kouyoh’s affections! Will Issei’s troubles never cease?

Included in Kids Are Doing Fine Today!! is a one-shot bringing two childhood friends back together—even if one of them scarcely remembers the other! When friendly Rion tries to befriend the delinquent Kagura for the second time in his life, Kagura ignores him. But as he finally gets fed up with Rion following him around, he invites Rion up to his room and…kisses him?! Does he really remember Rion after all?
