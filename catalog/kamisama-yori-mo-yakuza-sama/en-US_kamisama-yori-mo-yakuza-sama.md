## Sinopse

When I call, you better bring me the goods! Even the confession booth offers little protection from being violated by the wounded brute of a man...

Meet Shihoko, a young nun leading a peaceful life of purity. At least, she was until some gang members embroiled in a turf war take refuge in her church! The leader is a quiet man of large build with sharp, piercing eyes. Despite his terrifying demeanor, however, Shihoko is grateful for his help, and refuses to give up on him. She wants to get to know him better, but he immediately takes things to a "physical" level!! An immoral romantic comedy of erotic love!
