    "sinopse": "The Ribika are a race of cats possessing ears and tails. Their bodies are lithe and nimble, and they live in the land of Shisa. However, a curse called the \"Void\" is spreading through the forests...\n\nOne of the Ribika, Konoe, lives in a small village called Karou. One morning, he wakes up to find that his ears and tail have turned black. There is also a symbol on his body; the mark of the curse. Konoe embarks on a journey through the forest to find the truth.\n\n(Source: KakerA Translations)",
