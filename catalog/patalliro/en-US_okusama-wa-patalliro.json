    "sinopse": "The story features our hero, Opata, a ten-year-old boy who bears a suspicious resemblance to Patalliro, but has quite a different personality. He's working at a part-time agency as a cleaner to pay off debts left by his late father. Randomly, his employer Okuma (the most obvious okama in the history of Japan) tells him she has a new job for him, posing as the wife of an American tycoon visiting Japan whose real wife has disappeared. Opata bears an eiree resemblance to the run-away wife. The tycoon has no idea that Opata is actually a boy. The episode is such a success that his old school friends want to hire Opata themselves, since they had a crush on the wife in college. Okuma drags him to America, where they become stranded. Thereafter, Opata keeps up his female disguise to lure in men in various crazy schemes of Okuma so that they can raise enough money to return to Japan.\n\nHilarity results from Okuma's various surprising skills (such as contacts in the CIA, the ability to catch, prepare, and cook rabbits, and a mean leg for hitchhiking a ride)... as well as Opata's surprising affinity for cross-dressing",
