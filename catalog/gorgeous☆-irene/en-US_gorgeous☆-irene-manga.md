## Sinopse

Irene Lapona may have a youthful face and gentle physique, but when she applies makeup, she can utterly transform her appearance to look any way she pleases. Gorgeous, yet "so sadistic," Irene moonlights as a professional assassin. As skilled as she is, however, when another assassin targets her for revenge, she faces the toughest fight of her life.

In different settings of time and space, three separate tales occur. In the wild west, a historic poker game is about to unfold between two of its biggest outlaws, who are as unparalleled in skill as they are in deception. Far off in the deep reaches of space, a two-man freighter crew find themselves at the start of a tireless game of survival when a mysterious outsider plants a bomb within their ship. Finally, in a sleepy little town, clever young swindler B.T. finds that he'll have to put all his tricks to the test when the object of his affection comes into harm's way.

In Gorgeous☆Irene, JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken mastermind Hirohiko Araki brings together a collection of tales of gamblers and tricksters with "heroes" who throw righteousness straight out the door.
