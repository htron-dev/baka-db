## Sinopse

University student Nokichi has a crude, tomboyish female friend named Sabae. One day, to get a consultation on love matters the two go for a drink and unexpectedly the big-breasted Sabae approaches Nokichi on a whim... Is it a friendly approach? Or a sexual approach?

The curtains fall for the almost unreasonable campus life!
