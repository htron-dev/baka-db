    "sinopse": "Ichabod was born to Mary and Eli, a lesbian couple. Now in grade school, Ichabod believes that his father is the legendary bandit, Magic Monsieur. After Eli disappears, Mary raises Ichabod on her own. Ichabod is troubled because Mary wanted a daughter instead of a son. One day he ends up in the hospital, where he meets Guns, a top associate of The Red Rose Friend's Club, a group of bandits. Ichabod learns that Gun's older sister is the leader of this gang and Monsieur's lover. He helps Guns run away. As he gets involved with the gang, he learns about the dark side of his hero, Monsieur. Through an encounter with Kirico, a beautiful girl who claims that she is the daughter of Monsieur, Ichabod goes in search of his past.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
