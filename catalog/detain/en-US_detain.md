## Sinopse

A drink with friends leads to Zack waking up bound to a chair and blindfolded in the middle of nowhere. Was he captured for organ trafficking?! Is he being held for ransom?! No. When the blindfold falls and he finds his rich, enigmatic, friend Julian is holding him captive, Zack will soon discover he is being detained for something else entirely...
