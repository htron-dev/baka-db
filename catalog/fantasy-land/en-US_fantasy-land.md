## Sinopse

Ji-Yoon's life is a mess! Her father has decided that she must get married as soon as she graduates high school - the last thing she wants! As she walks the streets in her gloom, she is strangely drawn to a statue in a shop window. She purchases it for a bargain price and brings it home. The day that Ji-Yoon dreads the most arrives - the day she must meet her new fiance. But she is saved from her fate when the statue comes to life and takes her to another world, a world where Ji-Yoon is known as Princess Isdale and must battle against the evil Cardiff, who covets her Lunar Mirror. Has she escaped the frying pan only to land in the fire?
