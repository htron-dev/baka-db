    "sinopse": "Within 10 min walk from station. A convenience store close by. Perfect apartment for singles (couples are not allowed). But... there is one condition for those who want to move in—you must be able to attend breakfast that starts at 6:30 AM, that's all. In that a gem amongst the pebbles apartment lives Hashimoto Shoujirou, a clerc, creating, with others, a colorful mosaic of characters. They all have different personalities, from middle-aged man to middle-school girl—different ages, but everyone lives under the same roof with one kitchen.\n\n(Source: MU)",
