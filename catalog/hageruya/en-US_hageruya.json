    "sinopse": "Shota is only in high school but has been struggling with his thinning hair the past few years. He can't tell his family or his best friend Sachio or even get the courage to ask out his crush Shinohara Ami because he is afraid she might find out his secret. Then one day, the clumsy science teacher Mai approaches him and offers to solve his hair problems. Shota is very skeptical at first and avoid her but as the issue gets worse, he desperately turns to Mai as a last ditch effort.\n\n(Source: Shinnen)",
