    "sinopse": "Opal Halloway, the daughter of a Count, was prepared to inherit her family's title. Although she once dreamed of a romance brimming with love, she cast that wish aside after an incident in her debut year caused her to be cast out of her social circles. Beloved by everyone in the manor and accompanied by her childhood friend Claude, she was happy to take over the estate. However, her plans are thrown out the window when her father arranges her marriage to the poverty-stricken Duke Hubert Macleod.\n\nStill, Opal hopes for the best, but Hubert only sees her as a power-hungry noble who took advantage of his financial woes to acquire his title. Thus, he throws her into the attic and forbids her from going near the true lady of the house, Stella Northam.\n\nSpurned by Hubert and hated by the servants, Opal resolves to make the most of her situation, helping the people of the Macleod dukedom with her strong will and kind heart.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
