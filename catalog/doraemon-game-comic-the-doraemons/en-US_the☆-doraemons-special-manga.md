## Sinopse

Another journey of The Doraemons. This series have a very major difference with Nobita's frequent participation in most of the Doraemons' adventures, instead of the only focus on the Doraemons. However, other recurring characters from the main series (Shizuka, etc.) and human partners of other DD7 members don't have too much focus as same as Nobita. The adventures mostly appear in many different eras rather than 22nd century, and some of the character settings have slight differences from the original version by Tanaka.
