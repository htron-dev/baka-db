    "sinopse": "This is a story. The end to the saga of Koyomi Araragi.\n\nThis half-human, half-vampire has stood on the line between reality and the supernatural for far too long. The end to his indecision has finally come. Piece by piece, his humanity was falling away, starting with his reflection. He was becoming one of them—a vampire.\n\nNow, Araragi must choose which world to live in and which to give up. To remain human, he must abandon the friends he made through encounters with the supernatural. On the other hand, he would have to sacrifice his humanity to stay with those he holds dear.\n\nKoyomi Araragi must decide, and his decision will haunt him until the very end. Either way, tragedy seems inevitable, a culmination of every choice made since the very beginning.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nThis entry includes the final season of the Monogatari Series.",
