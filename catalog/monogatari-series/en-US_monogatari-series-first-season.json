    "sinopse": "This is a story, a \"ghostory\" of sorts, about scars that bond, monsters that haunt, and fakes that deceive.\n\nThe story of Koyomi Araragi begins through a fateful encounter with the all-powerful, blonde-haired, \"hot-blooded, iron-blooded and cold-blooded\" vampire, later introduced as Shinobu Oshino. Their tragic rendezvous results in the end of Araragi's life as a human and his subsequent rebirth as a vampire—a monster. However, this encounter is only the start of his meddlings with the supernatural. Koyomi's noble personality ultimately sees him getting further involved in the lives of others with supernatural afflictions. This is his desperate attempt at returning to a normal human life, in a paranormal world filled with nothing but tragedy, suffering, and inhumanity.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nThis entry includes the first season of the Monogatari Series.",
