As she tears through flesh and bone for her vendetta, she encounters SIRRUT, a group of ingenious hackers, who enlist Saya to help them defeat a common enemy—someone she knows all too well.\n\nUnfortunately, the path she follows is paved with tragedy, as once again, Saya faces betrayal at the hands of those she has come to trust.
