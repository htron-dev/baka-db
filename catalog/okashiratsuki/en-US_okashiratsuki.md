## Sinopse

Nachi belongs to the softball club; however, unlike others students in her school, she is less prone to getting sunburnt and thus has a pale skin complex. She is labelled as a peculiar and unbearable girl by her classmates, as she rejects confessions from popular boys. The story begins to unfold when she suddenly becomes interested in a boy named Utsumi in her swimming class.
