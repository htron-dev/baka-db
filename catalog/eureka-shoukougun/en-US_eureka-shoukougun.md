## Sinopse

Yuriika is a very handsome or pretty boy, who somehow always seems to get stalkers and people of all genders to fall in love with him, except his best friend Ryuu! Ryuu ends up always down in luck when it comes to women. Once they see Yuriika they all fall for him instead. But Ryuu still helps Yuriika out when he has no where left to go and they start living together. Many odd circumstances arise in this cute semi-BL comedy!
