    "sinopse": "Hazuki is your normal high school girl who just started working part-time at a flower shop. There, she falls in love at first sight with the gentle and manly Ryo in his National Defense Academy (Boudai) uniform. However, Hazuki, being inexperienced with love and also in awe of Ryo's Boudai uniform, has mistaken her feelings as a sign of her uniform fetish instead.\n\nBouei Daigakkou (The National Defense Academy of Japan) is known for being the strictest academy in Japan where future leaders of the Japanese Self-Defense Force attend. With many restrictions such as no sharing an umbrella and of course no holding hands, love with a Boudai boy is filled with many unique hurdles! What will be the outcome of Hazuki and Ryo's super pure love story?\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
