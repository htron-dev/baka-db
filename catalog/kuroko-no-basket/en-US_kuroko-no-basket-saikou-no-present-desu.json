    "sinopse": "It is Tetsuya Kuroko's birthday. In celebration, Satsuki Momoi has invited the other members of the Generation of Miracles to play basketball together and rekindle the memories from their nostalgic middle school days. Meanwhile, Taiga Kagami and his fellow teammates of Seirin High are doing their best to prepare for Kuroko's birthday party.\n\nSometimes, the best gift one can receive is not a material one but, rather, the feeling of having fun with everyone!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
