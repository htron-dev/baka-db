    "sinopse": "After a very public (and humiliating) break-up with her last boyfriend, things couldn't get any worse for 18 year old Emiko. Things start looking up however, when a good-looking guy stops her in the middle of the street to offer her tickets to an upcoming rock concert.\n\nAs it turns out, he's just one of three brothers from the Kanita family: Gaku - 18, Youji - 19, and Masaki - 23. A chance encounter with his older brother, Youji, leads to a whirlwind romance. He's impulsive, hot-headed, and even a bit self-centered, but she finds his frankness, though brutal at times, refreshing and she ends up falling for him....HARD.\n\nAn unexpected turn comes her way however when it's revealed that Youji and Yuri, a close friend of hers from back in middle school, knew each other long before she met Youji. They don't seem to get along at all----what happened between them?\n\n(Source: MangaUpdates)",
