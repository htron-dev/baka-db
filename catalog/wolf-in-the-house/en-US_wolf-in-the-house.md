## Sinopse

After ending an on-again, off-again relationship of 10 years, Minsuk decides to foster a Siberian husky named Bexan to mark the start of his new single life. He can't wait to cuddle with his new furry roommate, take him on walks, and play fetch. But Bexan is no ordinary dog... and when night falls, Minsuk is in for a surprise.
