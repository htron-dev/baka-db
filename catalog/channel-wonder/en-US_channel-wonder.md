## Sinopse

Kisaragi Arisu has wanted to be an idol for a long time. When she blew her last chance, a guy ran into her and dropped his watch. She tries to find him, but finds herself in Channel W director's office instead. The director told her he needed a girl to do a report on his show. She readily took the job, thinking that this was a debut she was looking for. Will this be her big break?
