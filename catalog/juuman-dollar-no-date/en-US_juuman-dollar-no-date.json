When she first meets the young computer magnate, Cara is convinced that Wyatt is nothing more than a playboy who has to have control over every situation. But sparks begin to fly when Cara finds herself spending a weekend in New Orleans with Wyatt, and she begins to see another side to this seeming playboy. Will Cara open her heart to Wyatt, or keep it closed off from this alluring bachelor forever?\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
