## Sinopse

High school sophomore Komukai Masaru's life is turned upside-down once his brother's wife moves in. Although it was supposed to just be a temporary residence until both of them found a home of their own, now Masaru's living alone with her while his brother is abroad.

At first glance she's the perfect wife: attentive, cute and a great cook, but it seems she's hiding a secret...?
