## Sinopse

In a gloomy town, where three girls have gone missing, high school girl Makioka Shizue witnesses an attack on a fellow classmate. The assailant appears to be none other than fellow student Endou Yasuko, a striking beauty who declares to Shizue that she is starving, and only Shizue can sate her hunger! Is Endou Yasuko a vampire, a serial killer—or just plain weird? And what does she really want from Shizue…?
