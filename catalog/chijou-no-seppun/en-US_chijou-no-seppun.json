This is the start of a cohabitation story between a woman who thinks \"It's more fun to be fulfilled with my interests rather than love,\" Waka, and a man who has an unrequited love while doing everything he can to persuade her, Shinobu! Waka, who's a librarian, was looking for a place to move into with her huge collection of books. In the midst of that, she suddenly reunited with Shinobu, a researcher, who suddenly kissed her back in high school while reading Junichirou Tanizaki's A Fool's Love...?! They suddenly started living together, and when he confessed that he \"liked\" her, Waka turned him down immediately...?!\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)",
