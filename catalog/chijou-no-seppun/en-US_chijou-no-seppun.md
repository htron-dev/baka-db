## Sinopse

Is it pleasant to be object of obsession of a perfect man? This is the start of a cohabitation story between a woman who thinks "It's more fun to be fulfilled with my interests rather than love," Waka, and a man who has an unrequited love while doing everything he can to persuade her, Shinobu! Waka, who's a librarian, was looking for a place to move into with her huge collection of books. In the midst of that, she suddenly reunited with Shinobu, a researcher, who suddenly kissed her back in high school while reading Junichirou Tanizaki's A Fool's Love...?! They suddenly started living together, and when he confessed that he "liked" her, Waka turned him down immediately...?!
