## Sinopse

For thousands of years, the world has contained "magai," foul beings who impersonate gods and create catastrophes to feed on the resulting destruction. The true gods are no longer able to triumph against these creatures, so they have no choice but to resurrect the one person capable of exorcizing magai: the Great Priest Imhotep.

Hinome Hawakata is a high school girl who is rumored to be cursed and thus is shunned by her peers. Her life changes after Imhotep rescues her from a magai who was possessing her body. As thanks for his actions, Imhotep starts to live with her family, which leads to a strange friendship forming between the two.

But as Imhotep's past begins to pursue him and new enemies appear, will he be able to carry out his mission to save the universe from absolute chaos?
