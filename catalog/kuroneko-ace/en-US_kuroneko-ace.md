## Sinopse

He punishes the strong and helps the weak... He's the living legend, the black cat, Black Ace!

"Don't be slaves to humans!" "Fight me with your true cat nature!" "You weakling! Guys don't cry like babies!" Despite sounding arrogant at times, he often comes off as a heel. However, behind his big talk is a love for his feline brothers and sisters.

Witness Ace's enjoyment-filled journey where he'll completely convince you that cats can be "handsome" and not just "cute!
