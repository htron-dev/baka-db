## Sinopse

Three girls on the verge of finishing high school: each contemplating their childhood dreams and aspirations. As they face this time of emotional turmoil and self-doubt, samples of embroidery from different places and times echo with the life stories of those who created them.

These girls' stories, past and present, intertwine as if woven by thread...
