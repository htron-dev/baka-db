   Kaname lost both of his parents at a young age, and though he reconnected with his wealthy grandfather, the old man died within a year, leaving Kaname a beautiful exclusive apartment and a kindly butler, Hidaka. Can Kaname find solace in Hidaka care, or is his affection just that of a servant?

2-4. A Season For Three
Clueless Yukihito has always relied heavily on surrogate old brother and songwriter Reichi, but he worries about what will happen when Reichi gets a girlfriend.
