## Sinopse

The story of a girl called Ichiko, who lives alone in a forest. Each chapter features a dish or meal scavenged or harvested from Ichiko's surroundings in rural Komori ("little forest"). While there are no wild flights of fancy as in Witches or Hanashippanashi, the organic linework and majesty of nature featured within tap into that same source of magic. Little Forest is a very acquired taste on its own, but just another piece of the stunning tapestry Daisuke Igarashi continues to weave today.
