## Sinopse

Two brothers leave their city life of fame and fortune for a more healthy alternative at their grandfather's farm. Zenta is the younger of the two brothers and is very sickly. Because of this, his older brother Ryou decides to drag his girlish younger brother to the countryside. Though Ryou and Zenta are without parents after an accident five years before this story takes place, they are able to support themselves well with their music career while in the city.
