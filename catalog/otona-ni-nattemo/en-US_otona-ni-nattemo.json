    "sinopse": "Ayano is a teacher with a steady job, a good relationship with her students and their parents, and a seemingly comfortable life - but when she runs into an attractive, charismatic woman at an old favourite bar of hers, they soon find themselves making some very rash decisions... and they may not both be being entirely honest with each other.\n\nFrom acclaimed mangaka Takako Shimura, a story of tangled feelings, secrets, and, frankly, just some awful human beings.\n\n(Source: Sexy Akiba Detectives Translations)",
