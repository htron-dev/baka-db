    "sinopse": "Despite having returned to his alma mater, high school teacher Hiyori is still spending every day alone. When he hears a rumour about a god of love at the school, he makes a wish to meet his destined one. Soon afterwards, he runs into a younger colleague, Uzuki, and has an unwitting \"reaction\" to him! Uzuki turns out to be a former student who confessed to Hiyori 5 years ago. Now he says \"I still like you\"...\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
