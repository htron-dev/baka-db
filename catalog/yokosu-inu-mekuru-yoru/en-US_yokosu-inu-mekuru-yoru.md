## Sinopse

The setting is a yakuza-run casino. Part-timer Shintani finds himself involved in an embezzlement scheme the hood and casino dealer Kikuchi was part of and ends up receiving punishment. The one who ordered the punishment is the boss's "woman," Sudou. Shintani is petrified at the sudden order, but with the promise of Sudou taking him in his mouth, he might see his way to raping a sobbing Kikuchi...

Raise the curtain and jump into the middle of a messy, underworld, three-way relationship!
