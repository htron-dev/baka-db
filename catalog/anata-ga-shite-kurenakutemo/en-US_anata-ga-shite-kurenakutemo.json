    "sinopse": "Michi Yoshino is unsatisfied with her married life. She and her husband, You, get along just fine save for one fact: they haven't had sex in two years. In a romance that has grown stale, Michi wants to rekindle what they once had, but You is indifferent, always pushing it off to another day. As the distance between them grows ever more insurmountable, they drift apart emotionally and become disconnected.\n\nLuckily, Michi finds solace in her coworker Makoto Niina, who is in a similar situation with his own wife. Bonding over their shared pain, they give advice and support to each other. The two grow closer, each working to save their own marriage, but is there truly any love remaining to reignite?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
