## Sinopse

Experience the robot maid occupation like you've never seen it before in Hinadori Girl. Support Robot: Sally 001 has just been completed by boy technophile Yoshiki. Yet her "hinadori" or Fledgling personality makes her ill-suited in her role as a maid and leaves Yoshiki very smitten with her. Evil teachers and jealous sisters round this quirky cast of slapstick literature.
