## Sinopse

The outside world must be so exciting! Princess Vanessa, of Volzemburg Kingdom, will become queen one day, and she's lived a life without freedom. Even when she visits New York on her royal duties, all she can do is smile elegantly and adhere to her strict schedule. As a 20-year-old young woman, she tires of her restrictive life, but with the help of a friend, she manages to escape for a few days. Walking through this exciting city, eating junk food and falling in love...all for the first time. But the clock keeps ticking and her time will soon run out!
