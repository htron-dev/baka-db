    "sinopse": "Lately, Misaki's life has taken an odd turn. Going to work has become more difficult. It isn't because he hates his job. Instead, Misaki is struggling to show his face to work because a brash college student called Kushiro is regularly bruising up his face. Misaki's fights with Kushiro should have been normal. A typical jab here, an ordinary bruise there. But, as Kushiro keeps throwing the punches, Misaki realizes he might just like it.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
