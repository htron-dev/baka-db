## Sinopse

Oodaka Tsubasa is an energetic young boy who is eager for his brand new high school life in the boarding school. After a certain coincidence, he saves his next-door neighbor in the same dorm from an attempted suicide. Tsubasa later learns that this suicidal is known as "Kamibako" (Paper Box), a famous ex-game commentator who is trying to take his own life for unknown reason.

The meeting between these two polar opposites soon raises the curtain of a "poisonous adolescence"...!
