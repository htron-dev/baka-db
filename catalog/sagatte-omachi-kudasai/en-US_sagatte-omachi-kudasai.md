## Sinopse

Sweet but shy Tanaka is an attendant at a local train station. He has a strange, yet strong aversion to being touched, despite a job requiring constant physical contact from others. All seems well until businessman Doujima discovers Tanaka's personal secret. Tanaka demands keeping their distance, but Doujima insists otherwise, taking advantage of his weakness. What exactly are Doujima's true intentions, and how will Tanaka react to them? Only time will tell for this unlikely duo!
