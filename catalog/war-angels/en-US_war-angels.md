## Sinopse

Almost five hundred years from now, life on Earth struggles to survive in the aftermath of an apocalyptic war. Beasterians, scientifically created human/animal mutants designed to be strong, disposable soldiers, are now the masters of the remaining humans. Humanityâ€™s one hope is the birth of a savior who will lead them out of the darkness. Before that time can come, however, three angels, all superb warriors, must fight to save the life of the Holy Mother.
