## Sinopse

Due to her mother's recent paralysis, Yuzu Horiuchi's life takes a sudden turn when she transfers from a prestigious all-girls high school to a co-ed one. As Yuzu struggles to adjust to a new routine with the help of some friendly classmates, she meets seemingly quiet Soutarou Kashio at a puppy adoption gathering. Together, they become enamored with the same Shiba Inu puppy they straightforwardly name "Shiba." The only problem is, neither one claims they can take care of it. However, when the puppy goes up for adoption, Yuzu finds herself in a bidding war and loses—but it turns out that Shiba's new owner is none other than Soutarou!

Refusing to relinquish the pup, Yuzu proposes a compromise: she pays half of Shiba's expenses and they share joint custody. Together, Yuzu and Soutarou will raise Shiba and grow closer as pet-owners, friends, and maybe something more.
