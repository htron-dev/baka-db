## Sinopse

Shirou Matsunaga has been subject to irrationally cruel treatment by his treacherous three sisters. Seeking an escape from this hellish existence, he enrolls in a boarding high school. There, he meets Mirai Oda, his new roommate. Mirai, suffering from gender identity disorder, has the body of a woman, but the soul of a man.
