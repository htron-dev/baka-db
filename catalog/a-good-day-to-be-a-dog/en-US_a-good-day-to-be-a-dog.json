    "sinopse": "Schoolteacher Han Hana is afflicted with a certain family curse that has ruined every single one of her past relationships. The curse in question: whenever she kisses someone, she will turn into a dog every night. The only way to break free from the curse is to kiss the same person again as a dog.\n\nTo avoid this, Hana has kept her lips chaste her entire life. However, one drunken encounter with her coworker Jin Seon, who seems to hate her, turns her entire life upside down. Hana kisses him in her intoxicated confusion, causing her curse to surface. For Hana, who is a small and cute white dog, breaking the curse should be one simple kiss... but Seon is terrified of dogs?!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
