But in the last year of their high school lives they are placed into different classes. A small ripple is born in the unchanging days that pass by that makes the feelings they were unaware of start to bloom. Wanting to tell him, but unable to say it. The answer deep, deep within their hearts is...\n\nThe path of youth and high school boys unable to voice their love.\n\n(Source: MU)",
