## Sinopse

"Once noticed, it was..."

From the 1st year of middle school to the 2nd year of high school, Makihara Kai and Mizushiro Ren have been in the same class. But in the last year of their high school lives they are placed into different classes. A small ripple is born in the unchanging days that pass by that makes the feelings they were unaware of start to bloom. Wanting to tell him, but unable to say it. The answer deep, deep within their hearts is...

The path of youth and high school boys unable to voice their love.
