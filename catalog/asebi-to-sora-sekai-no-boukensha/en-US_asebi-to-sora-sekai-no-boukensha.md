## Sinopse

In this world, men live on islands floating in the clouds. But the heavens are also the domain of "dragon fish," gigantic monsters hostile to humans and their ships...

Yuu is one of the guards responsible for protecting citizens from fish attacks. In the company of Asebi, an android, he decides to go on an adventure. His goal? Discover the ancient island of Brant, capital of the legendary archipelago of Waldecia, which holds many vestiges of human civilization at the time of its heyday!
