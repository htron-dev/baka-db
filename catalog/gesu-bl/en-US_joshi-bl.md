## Sinopse

Occasionally, there are girls who appear in BL. Sometimes they act as rivals; sometimes as bystanders, or even a person who understands relationships between men.

This is an anthology of stories using the girls' point of view. Through their eyes and feelings, the boys' love will be painfully passed on.

Note: Story 3 was collected in Nanimo Iuna, and story 9 was collected in Kyuuhankagai Fukurokouji.
