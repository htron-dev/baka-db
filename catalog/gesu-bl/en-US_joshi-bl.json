Sometimes they act as rivals; sometimes as bystanders, or even a person who understands relationships between men.\n\nThis is an anthology of stories using the girls' point of view. Through their eyes and feelings, the boys' love will be painfully passed on.\n\nNote: Story 3 was collected in Nanimo Iuna, and story 9 was collected in Kyuuhankagai Fukurokouji.",
