    "sinopse": "As a young boy, Kazuaki \"Chie\" Fujikawa was embarrassed by his feminine appearance. He was also unable to speak up for himself very well and would often get stuck in situations that he disliked while being on the verge of tears. Another boy, Misaki \"Misa\" Yuudai—who called Chie by the nickname \"Chii-chan\"—had no trouble expressing his feelings. \"Misa-chan\" got along well with everyone, so after the two became friends, Chii naturally looked up to Misa as a role model.\n\nYears later, when Chii and Misa reunite in high school, both of their dramatic changes surprise each other! With the departure from their former and familiar dynamic, how should they regard one another now?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
