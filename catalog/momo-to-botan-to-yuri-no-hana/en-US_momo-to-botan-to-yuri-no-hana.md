## Sinopse

In a certain town there is a slightly odd maid café named Sasanqua. The most popular maid in the shop, Botan, has just received a love confession from the new girl, Momo, and can't help but have Momo on her mind. W-w-w-w-what if this is love!? E-even though we're both girls!? Why am I having these feelings!? This is a clashing-style maid café love (?) comedy.
