    "sinopse": "The bright and bubbly Yuzu Aihara, along with her girlfriend, the stern and stoic Mei Aihara, are ready to make up for their lost time in this continuation of their romantic journey. Harumi Taniguchi, Himeko Momokino, Nene Nomura, and the rest of the crew are prepared to lend their support to these two whenever needed. They can even count on the usually antagonistic Matsuri Mizusawa to cheer them on.\n\nMei is coming back home after six months away, and Yuzu couldn't be more excited! With their relationship now public, the two have decided to start over and do things properly this time around. However, Mei's tenuous future as the chairwoman of Aihara academy and Yuzu's university plans are some of the challenges they will have to figure out along the way. Undaunted, the two trust in each other's love and support, come what may.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
