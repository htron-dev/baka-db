    "sinopse": "As the conflict between Kenji Endo, his childhood friends, and cult leader \"Friend\" comes to an end, two mysteries remain—Friend's true identity and whether the threat of an \"anti-photon bomb\" before his death was legitimate. Hoping to find an answer, Kenji, alongside the United Nations, decides to use a virtual reality program created from Friend's childhood memories in this conclusion to a long journey that will span dozens of decades.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
