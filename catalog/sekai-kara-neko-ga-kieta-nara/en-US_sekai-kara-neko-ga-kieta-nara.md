## Sinopse

The protagonist, a 30-year-old postman and is plagued by a constant headache, visits a doctor and is told that he has a brain tumour and has not long to live. A devil appears before him and strikes up a bargain. His life will be extended in exchange for something in his life. As the phone disappears; so does the memory of his girlfriend, with the movie; his friend, the watch; his father... In this fantasy human drama, a man struggles with the conflict of erasing his own existence, or his love, friends and family.
