    "sinopse": "Ever since he was a child, Maeda Taiki looked plain and shabby, and has never been popular. For these reasons, he wanted to at least have a good sense of fashion as an adult. So before he knew it, he became a shop attendant at a fashion mall. He has now found someone that he likes…. an employee at the fashion mall's main department, Yagii Haruhisa. Not only is Yagii kind and handsome, he's friendly with everyone he meets. He's someone that Maeda simply can't help but admire. However, Maeda is aware that he doesn't stand a chance of loving someone like Yagii… That is, until an awkward question from Maeda causes Yagii to steal his first kiss?!\n\n(Source: MU)",
