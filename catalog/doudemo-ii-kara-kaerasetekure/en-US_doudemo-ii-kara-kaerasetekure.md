## Sinopse

A count's daughter who scored hopelessly on the school's exam, Rururia Talbot!

I was talking to my best friend Sarah while eating my favorite tart, before I ran into a fight between the Crown Prince Christoph and Duke's daughter, Irene.

The fantasy rom-com of a count's daughter who wants to return home peacefully begins!
