Asuka, who debuted as a manga artist at the age of 13 but has not had work since then and is now 19. Fresh off from graduating high school, she gets inspired by the works of Sachi, and decides to quit her job in order to become a manga artist again.

Later, she finds out that Morishita is actually Sachi.
