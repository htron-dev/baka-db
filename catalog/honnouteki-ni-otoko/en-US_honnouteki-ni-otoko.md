## Sinopse

Yasukuni is the heir of a distinguished family, one that prizes masculinity and stoicism. He also happens to be crazy about one of his private instructors, Kiyoi. Among the many lessons Kiyoi gives him is the art of sexual pleasures. However, Yasukuni wants Kiyoi to make love with him earnestly, not just as a form of instruction.
(from B-U)
