    "sinopse": "In a fishing village, a scrapped boat is cremated. Old fishing boats on the verge of death dream of deep-sea fish running through alleys, fishermen pulling their nets, the crying specter of a young girl... Various imagery appear and retreat like waves on a shore, inviting viewers into a daydream.\n\nThis poetic film garnered critical acclaim at an international scale, starting at the Oberhausen international short film festival.",
