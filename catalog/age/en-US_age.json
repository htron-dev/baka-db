    "sinopse": "Age! tells the story of Takano Eiji, a tennis player who was unable to defeat Saki at the finals of the regional championships the previous year. His problem? He doesn't know how to hit any spin and grows incredibly violent when he loses a match. Read this manga for a great combination of humor and sports. Think Prince of Tennis except much much funnier.\n(Source: We Hate Manga)",
