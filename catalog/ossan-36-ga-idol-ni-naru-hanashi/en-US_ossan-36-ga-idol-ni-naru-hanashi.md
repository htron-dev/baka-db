## Sinopse

Despite his kindhearted nature, 36-year-old Miroku Oosaki is hardly attractive. After losing his job due to his appearance, he has been an otaku NEET for the past decade and weighs a whopping 120 kg. However, support from his loving family has kept his spirits up during this unfortunate situation.

Miroku was content with this lifestyle until he came across a video of people dancing. Inspired, he decided to hit the gym and dance as well, eventually slimming down to an attractive hunk! After accidentally becoming an online sensation due to his good looks and fantastic voice, Miroku begins to catch the eye of every passerby. However, Miroku is more interested in joining a dance competition alongside 41-year-old, muscle-brained company director Yoichi Kisaragi and Shiju Onohara, a 40-year-old former host.

Thus begins the story of a new idol group—of three handsome, charismatic middle-aged men!
