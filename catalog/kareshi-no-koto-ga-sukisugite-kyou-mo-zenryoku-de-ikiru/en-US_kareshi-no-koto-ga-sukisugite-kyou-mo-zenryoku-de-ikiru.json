    "sinopse": "Merori's favorite thing in the entire world is her boyfriend Haru. He's mature, kind, and the one who always brings a smile to her face. Every time Haru comes home from work, she is quick to shower him with love and praise. But despite her overflowing display of affection for him, he responds rather nonchalantly. Luckily for these two, this contrast in expressing their love for one another does not affect their relationship whatsoever.\n\nBased on the tweets made by Merori herself, Kareshi no Koto ga Sukisugite Kyou mo Zenryoku de Ikiru!!! is a wholesome romantic comedy about a girlfriend who is completely crazy for her cool boyfriend.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
