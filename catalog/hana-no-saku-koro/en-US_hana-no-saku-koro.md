## Sinopse

By chance of fate, Godai met Mr. Yasuda, a rather pretty man, on his first delivery assignment up at Yamanoue Research Facility who greeted poor Godai with a beaming smile. Then the next day, was Mr. Aihara’s turn to receive parcels too. Only…he looks just like Mr. Yasuda. What the hell’s going on?! Never having anybody treat him so kindly before, Godai’s determined to get right down to the bottom of this!
