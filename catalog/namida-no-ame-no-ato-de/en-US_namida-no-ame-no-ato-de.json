    "sinopse": "Nurse Lucy is shocked to find her former pediatrician lover, Connor, is going to be taking over the pediatric ward at the hospital she works at. He'd left her to move to America, so why would he come back now? When she finds out, Lucy can't help but be anxious.

She doesn't want to let her old flame near her daughter, and Lucy swears that she'll never give in to his demands. But Connor has other ideas...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
