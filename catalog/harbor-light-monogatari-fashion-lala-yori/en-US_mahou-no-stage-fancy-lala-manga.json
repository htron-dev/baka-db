Within limits, and subject to varying degrees of control, she can draw in the sketchbook and bring the drawings to life. Miho can also transform into a teenage girl, whom she names Fancy Lala. Fancy Lala is scouted by Yumi Haneishi, the president of the talent agency Lyrical Productions, and begins the long road to stardom.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Toy no Kuni kara\nVolume 2: Jungle Princess, Kikki ni Omakase, Comecome Circus",
