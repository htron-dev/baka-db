## Sinopse

Love-affairs between the members of an army team, the Seal. The main characters are Jim and Roy, of whom Roy is the captain of the team. Although he acts quite tough, inside he is very weak and suffers from several bad experiences in his past.
Then there is also the young Cyril (?) who happens to be very self-destructive. The series is at time very explicit, but deals with themes like sexual abuse and rape in a sensitive way.
