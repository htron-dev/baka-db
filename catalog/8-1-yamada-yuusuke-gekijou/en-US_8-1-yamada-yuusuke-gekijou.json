    "sinopse": "What started as a fun day out quickly turns to one of horror when roller coaster passengers find their ride cut short and are left dangling from their seats, desperately clinging for survival. A voice through a speaker informs them that a game of survival is under way and the last one to hold on will be spared. Elsewhere, a vengeful high school student is determined to obtain the ashes from a cursed urn said to have demented powers. Accompanied by her worried friend, she sets out to the graveyard where it is said to be located, unaware that what awaits them is far more horrific than they ever could have imagined.\n\nFrom stories of an insidious group who plays with human lives for sport to chilling ghost fables with horrifying realities, 8.1: Yamada Yuusuke Gekijou compiles tales of dread, horror, and sickening cruelty. Happy endings are scarce, and survivors, if any, do not escape unscathed.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
