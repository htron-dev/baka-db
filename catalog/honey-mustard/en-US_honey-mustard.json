    "sinopse": "Ara, a pretty high school student, finally gets the chance to cozy up to the guy of her dreams, but she blows it and ends up kissing the wrong boy under fairly compromised circumstances. Hilarious complications, mistaken identities, and misinterpreted signals ensue, and Ara soon finds herself being backed into an arranged marriage she at first wants no part of...\n\nBut, as we all know, love has a way of blooming in the unlikeliest of places...and, of course, love eventually conquers all!\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
