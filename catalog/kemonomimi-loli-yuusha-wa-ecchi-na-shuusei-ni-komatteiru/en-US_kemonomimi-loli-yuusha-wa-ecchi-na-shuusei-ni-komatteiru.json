    "sinopse": "Isekai Revision, begin!! I, the great sorcerer Fluffy, am what's called a \"World Reviser!\" I'm going to resolve all of the abnormal phenomena that the furry-eared hero Miya stumbles upon with magic! ...or so I thought, but what is this immodest situation that Miya has found herself in!? The truth is, I am the cause of the abnormal phenomena. I wrote this world myself long ago in my immature novel. And so, I continue to clean up after my own mess through \"Revision.\" It's all in an effort to better this world!\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
