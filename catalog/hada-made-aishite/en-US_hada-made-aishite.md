## Sinopse

Young President Tsugumi, who must worry about business problems, can't forget the stranger he unintentionally spent one night with. However, when they meet again, the guy turns out to be the new manager of the Planning Department, Mayuzumi, who was scouted for the reconstruction of the company. Mayuzumi puts on the mask of a capable subordinate during the day, then when night comes, embraces Tsugumi. An adult superior-supplanting LOVE.
