## Sinopse

It's the year 2016 and the Australian city of Miliopolis has been overrun by gangs, violence and crime. To fight against this, the government created the MPB Task Force aka Cerebus. The agency recruited children that had physical disabilities and they were given prosthetic parts that helped them become human weapons. The elite members of Cerebus are teenage girls code named Suzutsuki, Kagerou, and Yugiri. They use advanced technology and combat capabilities to exterminate the diseases that have infested the city.
