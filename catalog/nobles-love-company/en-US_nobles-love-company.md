## Sinopse

Lang Lang, a 15-year-old Korean girl, got adopted by the Freeman family in England, when she was three years old. With a big donation from the Freeman family, Lang Lang got accepted into the prestigious 'IDOL' high school. The school is very famous for its smart, famous, and rich students. Lang Lang's step-brother, Ian Freeman, has never accepted Lang Lang as his sister, and even though he's the school body's president and the head idol, as he excels in everything he does, he decides not to help out when his biggest rival, Choe Jang Gun, targets Lang Lang.
