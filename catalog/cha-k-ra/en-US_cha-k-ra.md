A shape-shifter wolf who was once a human, but became a demi-immortal when his lover betrayed and murdered him adopted an orphaned boy, who is now a young man. They travel together, exorcising evil spirits and demons. Trouble follows and finds them often, but they always manage to come out on the other side, pretty much intact.
