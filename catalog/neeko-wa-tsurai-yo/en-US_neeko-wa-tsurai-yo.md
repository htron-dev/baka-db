## Sinopse

"What do you do for work?"

When confronted with this question, the 23-year-old Nemuko Niito, nicknamed Neeko, can only shrink away in embarrassment. Despite her loving family's nudges and encouragement, she has so far failed all her job interviews. Life is never more difficult as the unemployed NEET spends her anxiety-filled days holed up in her home, trying to avoid judgmental gazes and despairing at the success of others.
