## Sinopse

Popular phys-ed teacher Toshimitsu Sugaya has been given the assignment of keeping an eye on a gang of thugs in the school, particularly their leader Tatsumi Yoshino, the “Devil of Nami High.” However, he soon finds out that not only is Yoshino a decent guy, but he’s been idolizing Sugaya for over a year! It doesn’t take long for Yoshino to win over the reluctant teacher and the two start a secret love affair. Can a teacher/student relationship really work and how long can these two hide their secret?
