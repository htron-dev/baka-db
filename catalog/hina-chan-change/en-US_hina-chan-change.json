    "sinopse": "Hina Amano has just started going out with her crush, Makoto Kagami. Thoughtful and kind, Makoto is everything that a girl could possibly want, and she couldn't be happier. However, there is a secret looming over their relationship, one that not even Makoto knows: the person inside Hina's body is actually Makoto's friend Ren Takizawa.\n\nEleven years ago, Hina and Ren were childhood friends who discovered that they could switch bodies. But, like friends sometimes do, they drifted apart until high school, when Ren confessed to Makoto and was rejected. They decide to start switching bodies again, and Ren begins using Hina's body to fulfill his dream of dating Makoto, and Hina gets to enjoy being popular in Ren's body. But this body-switching will bring about changes in both of them, and some may not be for the best.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
