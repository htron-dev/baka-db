Rio is a boy living in the slums who wants revenge for his mother who was murdered in front of him when he was five years old.\n\nEarth and another world. Two people with completely different backgrounds and values. For some reason, the memories and personality of Haruto who should've died is resurrected in Rio's body. As the two are confused over their memories and personalities fusing together, Rio decides to live in this new world.\n\nAlong with Haruto's memories, Rio awakens an unknown \"special power,\" and it seems that if he uses it well, he can live a better life. But before that, Rio encounters a kidnapping that turns out to be of a princess of the Bertram Kingdom that he lives in.\n\nAfter saving the princess, Rio is given a scholarship at the Royal Academy, a school for the rich and powerful. Being a poor orphan in a school of nobles turns out to be an extremely detestable place to be.\n\n(Source: MU)",
