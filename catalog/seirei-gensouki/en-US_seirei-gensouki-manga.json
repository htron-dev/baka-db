Rio is a boy living in the slums who wants revenge for his mother who was murdered in front of him when he was five years old.\n\nEarth and another world.

But before that, Rio encountered a kidnapping that turns out to be two princesses of the Bertram Kingdom that he lives in.\n\nAfter saving the princesses, Rio is given a scholarship to the Royal Academy, a school for the rich and powerful.
