    "sinopse": "One day, Miwa's little brother came home late from playing by the Tama River with one of his friends and an adult man. He convinced Miwa to come meet the man, claiming he looked like Johnny Depp. Miwa and her friend Aya come to meet him after school and discover that was a total lie.\n\nHowever, Miwa finds herself drawn to the goofy young man, whose name is Haruo. To Aya's annoyance, Miwa develops a major crush on him and talks about him constantly. But could anything come of this crush, since Miwa is a first year high school student and Haruo is an adult? Miwa starts to get to know Haruo, meeting him day after day, there by the Tama River.\n\n(Source: MU)",
