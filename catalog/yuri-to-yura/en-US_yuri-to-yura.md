## Sinopse

Very interesting & impressive human comedy series about two boys who have been brought up at orphanage like real brothers : Yuri and Yura are students who are living at same orphanage. Yuri is very intelligent and always teaches Yura who has only the talent of boxing to be recommended by. But after taking a bath together, Yura begins to avoid Yuri's care. Yuri finally tells Yura his feeling and dashes out of the house in the snowy day like the day when they were abandoned at orphanage...
