## Sinopse

Of the major causes causing the collapse of modern medical care, the lack of anesthesiologists is most severe. At times serious and at times comical, this story of university hospital anesthesiologist Hanaoka Hanako realistically depicts her every day work and life. While she faces the struggles of hard work, low pay, and sexual harassment, Hanako is ready every day to administer anesthesia.
