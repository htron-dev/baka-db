## Sinopse

In the gothic Gray City, there lives a 17-year-old girl named Aime Komori, very clumsy and shy. But during the night, she uses her magic eyes powder, and she turns into Shadow Lady, an expert thief with great abilities, beautiful and daring. During the night, she must take care of not being captured by the police, especially the Inspector Dori, who always puts an obsessive energy in trying to catch her.
