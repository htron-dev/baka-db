## Sinopse

Rika is pretty, intelligent, and attracts the attention of all students. As her house was collapsed, she came to live with Mitsuru's family. Mitsuru, who is a babe in the woods, tries to approach Rika repeatedly, but she regards him as a fool. Love is unpredictable, however. Rika finds it difficult to keep her virtue.
