## Sinopse

This is a story related to the Mashiroiro Symphony manga and visual novel game. An all-girl's school is preparing to consolidate with another nearby school, which will make them co-ed. Uryuu Shingo is chosen to be a male 'test student' at the girl's school before they officially merge in the following year. Though there was initially some opposition by the female student body, many of them have grown to like Shingo. His greatest opposition, Sena Airi, has even gotten used to him. However, the heroine of this story, Inui Sana, still hates all men in general and Shingo in specific. But could her blatant dislike be masking some other, truer feelings?
