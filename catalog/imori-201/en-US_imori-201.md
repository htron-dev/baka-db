## Sinopse

After failing his college entrance exams a second time, Kawashima is forced to move out of his home and into an apartment complex. No sooner has he moved in does the neighbour girl crash through his wall! Now his apartment is connected to hers, and it looks like his fantasy of meeting a cute high school girl has come true. However, there are some odd things about Imori. For example, she's always wearing some form of school uniform, and she lives alone in her apartment. Is Imori really who she claims to be?
