    "sinopse": "Konna Nichijou is about a self-conscious and tsundere beauty Ao and his lover Dai. Dai is head over heels for Ao as he finds it cute that Ao only acts sweet towards him, but Ao says it's too early to have a physical relationship. Therefore they are putting it on hold. So what will happen in one week, the deadline for when the two of them promised to have sex...?\n\n(Source: Nijiniji Nikubou Scans)",
