    "sinopse": "\"Stalker problem\" is overlooked as a serious social issue. The number of incidents increase day by day and are far from being solved. The curtain rises on a picaresque story set in a wonderfully distorted contemporary Japan where the warped are gathered and purified with poetic justice. What can purify darkness is darkness.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
