## Sinopse

Narasaki Naoto was born into a family of thieves. After committing a marriage scam, he is arrested and taken to the upscale apartment of elite detective, Oogaki Kaoru.

"I became a detective in order to distort that pretty face of yours."

As the good-looking Kaoru with a stalker tendency calmly says that, Naoto slowly warms up to him as their peculiar living arrangement starts.

A love story of captivity between a forceful detective x con artist.
