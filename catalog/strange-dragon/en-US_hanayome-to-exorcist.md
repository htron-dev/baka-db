## Sinopse

Demons have been attracted to Anne her entire life. At age seventeen, she learns that a demon lord wants to marry her–and literally drag her into hell! Luckily, she's got a talented young exorcist to keep her safe from the powerful fiend. There's just one issue: the brash exorcist is in love with her, too.
