    "sinopse": "This is the story of a very smart student called Hirama Ren who is used to always getting the top results in his school, and is the chairman of the student's council. One day, he walks past a group of bullies and asks them to leaveâ€”and because of that, they decide to teach him a lesson. They decide to beat up a couple of guys and they reported it to the teachers, blaming him.\n\nHirama becomes enraged by it and so he decides to attain some power that could allow him to change the world to a world that he wanted; one without such pathetic people.\n\nCoincidentally, his vice-chairperson called him and asked if he was fine with her inviting a hypnotist for some event at school to hype up the school population. Thinking that the ability of hypnotism is just what he was looking for, he agrees to it. During the \"trial\" test of the hypnotist's ability, he set up some plan and later on used it to test if hypnosis was able to hypnotize people who were avoiding it. With his new found knowledge, how will Hirama use this new power to reshape the world?\n\n(Source: Endless Abyss)",
