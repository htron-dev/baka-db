    "sinopse": "Ryota's got a problem... He's living with a ghost. And not just any ghost, but the ghost of his worst fear: a bully...! The ghost of an arrogant, former thug, Taiga, is ruining the happy campus life he's dreamed of!! Ryota tries to exorcise the spirit, but the conditions for Taiga's proposal to live together are a seductive nectar... Hang on for a slightly risque ghost-love comedy between a normal college student and a ghost with his own issues.\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
