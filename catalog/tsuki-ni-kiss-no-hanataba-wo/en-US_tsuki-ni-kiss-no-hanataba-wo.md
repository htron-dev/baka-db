Hitomi's childhood love was a boy named Atsuya who she met while on a holiday. They promised to meet again the next year, but he never showed up. She's never forgotten him and has always hoped she'd find him again. She meets a bar tender with the same name and is drawn to him. She decides to find out if he's the Atsuya from her past.
