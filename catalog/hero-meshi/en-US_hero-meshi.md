## Sinopse

Ryouta is a college student whose father has recently passed away. While he never showed much interest in his father's work as an anime producer, his younger brother Seiya became very into anime and tokusatsu, and the shock lead him to become a shut-in. Not even coming out to eat, Ryouta is eventually able to coax Seiya out by making the same food that the heroes in his favorite shows would eat, and at the same time become a bit closer to his late father.
