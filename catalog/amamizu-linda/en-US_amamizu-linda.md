## Sinopse

The manga centers on a club calling itself the "handicraft club," whose members secretly meet in an off-limits and abandoned school building. One member of the club finds a book in a second-hand bookstore that describes how to make a "doll." They gather cloth, twigs, sweets, glass, and rain water, and attempt to make something that resembles a human being.
