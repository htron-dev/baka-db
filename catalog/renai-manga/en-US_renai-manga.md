## Sinopse

Kuroi Ritsu's groundbreaking manga, "With You," was nothing short of successful and popular during Hada Haruka's high school days. Idolizing the manga's heroine of the same name, Haruka transformed her ordinary lifestyle to become a trendy and shrewd woman modeled after the protagonist.

After years of hard work, Haruka is hired as an editor for none other than Kuroi Ritsu herself. With high expectations, Haruka prepares herself to meet the person who changed her life, yet the reality she faces is a far cry from her fantasy.

Ritsu is shy and introverted, with a tendency to slack off and miss her deadlines. Avoiding her editor and shutting herself in her home, she gives Haruka nothing but trouble. However, the strong-willed and determined Haruka takes on the challenge and decides she will help Ritsu write her best manga yet.
