## Sinopse

In order to become a splendid devil in Hell History, a stubborn and reserved 6 year old, Robin Verall, will be entering Hell Academy elementary. He really hates to go to school so he hides in some weird places, resulting in him "being in a pinch!" Robin's homeroom teacher, Shiba-sensei, discovers him in an odd place and saves him from a pinch, and since then, Robin is feeling a bit more attached to sensei than ever. And goes through some Hellish schemes to tries to get closer.
