## Sinopse

O-Sato is willing to do anything to get revenge on the men who raped and murdered her younger sister, even if she must sleep with the perpetrators in order to get close enough to them to slit their throats. She is a viper longing to coat her fangs in the blood of the guilty. O-Sono marries into wealth and power. However, her jealousy soon drives her to punish her cheating husband right where it will hurt him the most. O-Kinu uses her innocent face and honeyed words to get whatever she wants, no matter the cost. She leaves a trail of the blood of her lovers in her wake. Sinister and sexy, the women illustrated in Femmes Fatales embrace their darkest natures. Men who enter into the barbed embraces of these deadly women are doomed to never leave. Hell hath no fury...
