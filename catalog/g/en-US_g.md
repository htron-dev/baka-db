## Sinopse

From a young age, Mao Manaka has had a fascination with race cars. One day, fate brings him together with Yoshiki Tsuji, the undisputed champion of formula racing in Japan. It was then that Mao decided to become a professional racer. Years later, Mao receives an invitation from Tsuji to apply for F.R.S, a prestigious school for incredibly gifted racers. It is there that Mao begins his journey to become a Formula One racer and, if all goes to plan, the first Japanese to win the F1 Championship.
