His eyes aren't the only things affected — his pheromones are working overtime, and all the hot beast breeds at school are looking to mate... with HIM! Just when he thinks things can't get any worse, his heavyweight schoolmate, Kunimasa, \"marks\" Norio as his! What's an in-demand premium to do?\n\n(Source: SuBLime)",
