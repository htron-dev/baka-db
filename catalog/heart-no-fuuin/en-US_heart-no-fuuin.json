A strange man appears, looking for a hero to seal the holy spirits in an alternative dimension. However, being small and cute, Toraichi doesn't exactly fit his \"perfect man\" criteria and is initially turned down. Unrelenting, Toraichi manages to strike a deal—if he can convince the \"perfect man\" Kanna Satoshi to join his party, Toraichi can become a hero!\n\n(Source: shinkeikaku)",
