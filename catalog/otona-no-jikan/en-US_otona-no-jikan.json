Instead of turning her in, Kaga wants an interview. It turns out he's an erotic novelist, and he's looking for just the right dose of high school girl reality for his latest work. Kaga makes it clear their relationship is strictly business, but can Mitsuka keep it that way when she's falling for her teacher?\n\n(Source: Lovers Dream)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Soshite, Kimi wa Boku wo Suki ni Naru\nVolume 2: Koisuru Sata mo Kane Shidai\nVolume 4: Tatoeba Namae wo Yobareru dake",
