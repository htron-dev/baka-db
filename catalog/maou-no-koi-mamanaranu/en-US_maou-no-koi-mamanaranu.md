## Sinopse

Entering high school, Fujimura Kotone dreams of making friends and finding love. However, her classmates avoid her because of her scary demeanor. One day, a group made up of two girls and a boy come into her class and kneel before her, proclaiming, "It's an honor to meet you, Demon Lord!". With their antics, will she be able to obtain the normal love life she desires?

A reincarnation romantic comedy that transcends space and time!
