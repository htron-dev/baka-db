## Sinopse

Kaoru, a passionate man who sleeps with anyone (man, of course) and seme par excellence, bumps into Shibuya at a bar, a man (hetero) just his type, who is venting the pain on the anniversary of his wife's death, seeing in him, the opportunity to "sleep with a man of his kind, the easy way." What will happen when, by coincidence, Kaoru was also the name of the deceased wife and Shibuya, being completely drunk, pushes him down on the bed and makes love to him, as if he were his dead wife?
