## Sinopse

Otonashi-san has just transferred into a perfectly ordinary high school. Silent and impassive, she's actually a kunoichi, a female ninja! (Not that she hides it well...) See what a ninja, the famous traditional Japanese hero, would be like as a high school girl in this off-beat, four-panel manga! Don't miss Otonashi-san's quirky appeal!!
