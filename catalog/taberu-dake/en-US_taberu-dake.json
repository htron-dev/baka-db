    "sinopse": "The gourmet manga revolves around a mysterious, perpetually hungry, goddess-like girl whose name, age, and job is unknown. This woman will appear out of nowhere only to have a meal with others. Each chapter follows her encounter with a new person: as she drinks milk with an elementary school girl after a bath, eats an entire cake with a lonely man on Christmas Eve, and even as she transcends time to eat deer hot pot with the inhabitants of a mountain village in ancient times. When she leaves, those she encounters are left with smiles on their faces.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Taberu dake (2-part pilot)",
