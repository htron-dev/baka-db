## Sinopse

Tempted by the beautiful afternoon, piano teacher, Toshiyuki, decided to play the piano with the window open. Before he realized it, an intruder had barged in through his window!? The intruder was none other than the talented surgeon, Mashiba, who works at the University Hospital nearby. Despite his cool demeanor, this surgeon started to pursue Toshiyuki most relentlessly! “You’re even more beautiful than the music you play,” he professed to the stunned Toshiyuki. Feeling totally harassed, would Toshiyuki be able to get rid of his stalker!?
