## Sinopse

Binta Yugawara is a "Bodz" or Bomber Kid, in the city of Atamu, who dreams of defeating his hero, Smash Kintaro. While in the city, he battles using a pog like game system, against several other Bodz, including Banji Chihara, BJ, and a man by the code name, "X."

Hiroyuki Takei (of Shaman King fame), is the supervisor for this series. All artwork is officially drawn by Kato Gaito, who later helped assist Takei with "Jyuki Ningen Jumbor." The series was canceled after 3 chapters and never met the intended 197 pages announced in the first chapter. Neither Shueisha nor Takei have ever officially mentioned this series since it was canceled.
