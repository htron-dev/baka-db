## Sinopse

Fairy tales and the elegant princes in them have fascinated Marielle Clarac since childhood, but deep down, she knows that sort of "happily ever after" does not exist for an overwhelmingly normal girl like herself. A wallflower her whole life, she has contented herself with observing others and writing her own novels about court life under a pen name. Marielle's drab outer appearance belies a creative mind, and as a result, these stories have achieved great success.

So it is no wonder that, when she gets engaged to the princely knight Simeon Flaubert, Marielle's creative juices start overflowing. Under normal circumstances, the most sought-after bachelor would not be asking for her hand; even so, Marielle resolves to give it her best shot. No matter how this engagement turns out, she will use this experience as fuel to set alight both her pen and her life!
