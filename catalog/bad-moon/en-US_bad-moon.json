    "sinopse": "Kazuki's had a 16 year grace-period of peace and relative normalcy; smuggled to Japan and raised by a kindly old woman he's grown up to be a bright and friendly boy. His childhood friendship to the girl next door is just beginning to blossom into romance and the death of his ward leaves him with enough character-building angst to set him up for just about any cliche shoujo adventure Yukari Ito has in mind. Unfortunately, Yukari Ito is TOTALLY insane and has decided to make him a vampiric kitten engaged from birth to a Nightmare.\n\n(Source: doki-doki)",
