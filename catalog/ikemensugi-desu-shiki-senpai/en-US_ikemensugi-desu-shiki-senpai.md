## Sinopse

When Hinami bumps into an older girl named Shiki, she falls head over heels. Shiki is sexy, easygoing, and has an amazing undercut. In order to get closer to Shiki, Hinami starts lurking around the basketball club. But though Hinami’s crush is obvious to everyone else, it goes right over Shiki’s head. When Hinami tries to confess her feelings to Shiki, Shiki thinks Hinami wants to become the club manager! Can Hinami get Shiki to understand her true feelings?
