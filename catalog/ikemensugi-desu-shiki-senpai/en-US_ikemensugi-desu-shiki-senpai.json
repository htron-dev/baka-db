In order to get closer to Shiki, Hinami starts lurking around the basketball club. But though Hinami’s crush is obvious to everyone else, it goes right over Shiki’s head. When Hinami tries to confess her feelings to Shiki, Shiki thinks Hinami wants to become the club manager! Can Hinami get Shiki to understand her true feelings?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
