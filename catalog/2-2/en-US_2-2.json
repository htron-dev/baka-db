    "sinopse": "Two pairs of twins (brothers, and a pair of cute sisters) meet each other after the brothers are transferred to a new school. The brothers suffer from a \"sharing of misfortune\" where anything unfortunate on one's body is reflected onto the other twin's body. On the other hand, the girls cannot leave each other for more than an hour or they will both wither and die. This is a light comedy and shounen style love story with lots of funny side characters and happenings.",
