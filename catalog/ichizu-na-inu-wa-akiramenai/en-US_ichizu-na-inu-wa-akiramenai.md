## Sinopse

Yuu Shimazaki, now a senior, is just looking forward to the day he enters college. He spends his time getting intimate with the people he likes. When one almost-sex encounter is interrupted by a younger student, Daisuke Akizuki, Yuu is embarrassed but moves on. That is until he finds out that he and Daisuke now live in the same dormitory. Looking to move the awkwardness away, he talks to Daisuke, whom Yuu is surprised to find taking things smoothly. But when Daisuke suddenly confesses his love for Yuu, things get complicated. For one, Yuu thinks it's just puppy love on Daisuke's part, but the latter is determined to prove him wrong. Is Yuu ready for Daisuke's feelings, especially when he hasn't fallen in love for real before?
