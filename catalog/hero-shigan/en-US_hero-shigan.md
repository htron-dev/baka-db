## Sinopse

Ever since he was a child, Tachibana Hideo has wanted to become a superhero like in the TV shows he watched. After he graduated from high school, he got into the Kantou Films School to chase this dream. In the summer beforehand, he managed to get a part-time job as a costumed villain for a "Crashman" heroes live show. Unfortunately, he got a little too into it, kicked the heroic "Crash Pink" in the face, and got himself fired. As he later discovered, Crash Pink was his future classmate and aspiring actress, Mutou Sakurako! Livid that he'd dare damage her precious face, she insisted that he make up for the injury, mostly by putting up with her constant efforts to torment him. But as they spend time together, could something much sweeter than mutual annoyance be growing between them?
