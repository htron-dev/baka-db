    "sinopse": "Sakiyama Youji has been absent for around year due to health problems. Upon returning to high school, changes started to occur to him. For instance, Shironuma Tetsuo, a guy who Youji rarely speaks to starts approaching him constantly, and when asked why, never gave an answer. At the same moment, Okinaga Zenya, appears right in front of his eyes, saying it's all his fault. Making matters worse, Youji starts having strange pains and nightmares. Will he be able to distinguish these feelings?\n\n(Source: rynisyou)",
