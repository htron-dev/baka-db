    "sinopse": "\"The coastal town in which I live, has everything but also nothing.\"\n\nSakura is a 2nd year high school student who lives an ordinary life. She believes high school life should be much more free, gorgeous, and filled with sparkles every day. But in reality, it's not like that at all... That's when Ao-kun, who is one year her junior, appears before her. Since meeting Ao, Sakura's ordinary days are now filled with sparkles.\n\nThis is a sweet, youthful love story between a super positive boy and super negative girl!\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)\n\nIncluded One-shot:\nVolume 2: Ai Aru Kimi to, Koisuru Usotsuki.",
