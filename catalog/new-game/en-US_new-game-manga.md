At Eagle Jump, Aoba is placed into a team of six, which includes the lead character designer for the original Fairies Story game, Kou Yagami. Getting mentored by her role model, Aoba strives to become a better character designer and learn the ropes of the video game industry.

New Game! revolves around the buoyant lives of Aoba and her team members. Together, the girls put their sweat and tears into the production of the new upcoming video game, Fairies Story 3—the third installment of the Fairies Story series.
