    "sinopse": "Still reeling from the childhood trauma of losing his family to a blaze, Shinra Kusakabe endures both the blessing and curse of being a third-generation pyrokinetic: a person gifted with the ability to freely control fire.\n\nMeanwhile, the Infernals—first-generation pyrokinetics who spontaneously combust into flaming, demonic creatures—ravage the streets of Tokyo. After he is recognized for his abilities, Shinra joins Special Fire Force Company 8, one of many fire brigades developed to combat these Infernals.\n\nAlthough working with the Fire Force seems to have fulfilled a calling, Shinra learns that becoming a hero is not as easy as it seems. Infernal sightings are worsening across the country, and his own fellow brigadiers struggle to unite against these threats. To make matters worse, Shinra's past returns to haunt him after he confronts a mysterious cult. As he endeavors to reach the truth, Shinra soon finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy that aims to engulf the world in flames.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
