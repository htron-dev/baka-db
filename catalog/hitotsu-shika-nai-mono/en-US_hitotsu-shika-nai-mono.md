## Sinopse

Haruhi feels insecure because his twin brother is so much more friendly, outgoing and popular compared to him, so he begins to spiral out of control, sleeping with strangers he meets at a bar. Another patron of a bar he frequents sees that he’s in trouble and befriends him, and they gradually move from friends to lovers.
