    "sinopse": "Sasakura Ryuu is a college student who also writes a particularly bloody series of light novels. One day, he meets a mysterious young fan with the name of one of his characters, \"Mikato.\" Since Mikato is one of the characters Ryuu is planning to kill off in his next novel, this raises some questions about what, if any, responsibility Ryuu has towards his fans and what they might take away from his work. These questions only grow worse when murders begin to occur that blatantly copy specific events in his novels. What's more, a \"fan\" that may be behind the murders begins sending him disturbing photo texts...\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
