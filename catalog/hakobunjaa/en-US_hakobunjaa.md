## Sinopse

God created angels to guard the peace in human world. Akamine Ryota is a promising senior at the angel training school, but because he lacks full control of his powers he's not allowed to graduate. Fellow students Shirogane, Aotsuka and Kurosawa are in the same predicament. Together, the four are sent to Earth - to purge the human world of evil and to finally complete their angel qualifications! (Source: East-27)
