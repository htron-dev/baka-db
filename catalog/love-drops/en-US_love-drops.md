## Sinopse

Mio is an aspiring wedding dress designer who dreams of having the fairytale wedding: a beautiful wedding dress, loving husband, and an everlasting relationship where husband and wife will support each other through thick and thin. Unfortunately, her boyfriend of two years (and co-habitating lover of one), Tatsuya, thinks otherwise as he tells her, "as long as we're together and happy, there is no need for marriage." As Mio's traditional ideals of marriage and Tatsuya's modern ideals of co-habitation collide, what will happen when Mio learns that she might be pregnant?! (Source: Luv Luv Press)
