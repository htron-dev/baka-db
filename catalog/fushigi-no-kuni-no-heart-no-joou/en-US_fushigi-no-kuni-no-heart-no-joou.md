## Sinopse

In the prolonged absence of the King and Queen of the Kingdom of Hearts, their daughter, Princess Eleonor, was compelled to hastily ascend the throne. At that moment, memories of Eleonor's previous life came flooding back to her, and it dawned on her that the world in which she currently resides is that of an otome game she once played...?

All the words that pass her lips turn into venomous barbs, leading her down the destruction route at full speed—!!
