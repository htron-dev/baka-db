At that moment, memories of Eleonor's previous life came flooding back to her, and it dawned on her that the world in which she currently resides is that of an otome game she once played...?\n\nAll the words that pass her lips turn into venomous barbs, leading her down the destruction route at full speed—!!\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
