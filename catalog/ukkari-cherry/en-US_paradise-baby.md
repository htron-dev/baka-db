## Sinopse

(Continuation of Ukkari Cherry's oneshot 'Nemurenu Yoru ni Nomikonda Hoshi'.)

After finally winning Sawa's heart and becoming his lover Shiroi still can't let himself be at ease--the more he's with Sawa, the more he realizes how frighteningly close Sawa and his best friend Micchan really are. And it doesn't help that Sawa seems to invite Micchan to go with them every time they can be alone. How can Shiroi make Sawa prove that he's really number one in Sawa's heart?

Also includes short stories 'Love Letter' and 'Kira Kira'.
