Her new roommates, Shitanaga (Niko) and Shinomae (Miko) are just the kind of girl Iko wants to surround herself with to become more girlish. Iko soon learns from her classmates about a rumored object called the Chalice that grants wishes. It was originally stored in an abandoned church on campus but recently, it has been stolen, much to Iko’s dismay. The three roommates go to the church to investigate the missing object where they meet 2 mysterious figures Siren and Reverse Cross who have the Chalice. However, they escape before the girls have a chance to question them.\n\nWho are these mysterious figures that stole the wish granting Chalice? Who is Iko’s best friend Azuma, who is hospitalized? What is the connection between Iko’s search for the Chalice and her relationship with Azuma? Find out more by reading Death Communication.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
