## Sinopse

Naruse Hiroya is an ordinary high school student, but his normal daily life is often ruined by his friend Kokutou Miyabi. Miyabi has an intense personality, and he constantly drags Hiroya and their other friends at school (level-headed Wasshi and Katarun of the vision-obscuring hair) into the most ridiculous situations!
