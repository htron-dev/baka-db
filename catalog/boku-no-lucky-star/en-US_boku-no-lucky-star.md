## Sinopse

As a member of a wolf clan, Kiyoto uses his human form to "emigrate" in order to join an idol group and find himself a bride! However, far from being welcomed by his fellow group member Motoharu, it seems like Motoharu hates him. Kiyoto works hard in the lessons while hiding his secret, but on the night of a full moon, he can't hold back his instincts and ends up pushing Motoharu down on the bed...!
