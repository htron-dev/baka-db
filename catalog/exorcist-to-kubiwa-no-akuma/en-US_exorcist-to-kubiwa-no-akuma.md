## Sinopse

The great demon Almadiel has revived into the modern world, but finds herself trapped in the body of a helpless little girl due to a collar's seal. Somehow, she ends up freeloading off of a priest named Shuuto, but it seems like he fully intends on making Alma his toy...

This love(?) comedy 4-koma about a useless demon and a very sadistic priest starts now!
