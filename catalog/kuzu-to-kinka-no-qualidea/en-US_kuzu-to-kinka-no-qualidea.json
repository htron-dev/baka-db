    "sinopse": "Told through two perspectives, this is a tale about a world about to end and a dazzling time of youth—\n\nKusaoka Haruma, a student from a low-end high school, and the angelic underclassman Chigusa Yu. Two people who should not be in the same year level end up meeting as a result of a fateful incident. Abnormal weather, abnormal phenomena, abnormal actions. An ordinary life that falls off the rails little by little, and a bizarre urban legend.\n\nAccording to \"The Random Crossroad\"—at midnight, if you come to the end of the T-juncture and choose the wrong path, you can never come back.\n\nAs they chase after a girl whose whereabouts are unknown as a result of these events, could what they find exceed Haruma and Yu's wildest expectations…?!\n\n(Source: Fantastic Memes)",
