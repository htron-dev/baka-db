## Sinopse

If there isn't an alternate universe, then we'll just make one! Yuudai Yatsusaka, an enlightened high schooler who lives by the motto: live life in moderation. Kotonoha Jougasaki, the eccentric girl who wants to be in an alternate universe. It seems like the meeting of these two polar opposites will cause a huge disturbance in Yuudai's mundane school life! It's a weird story of an Isekai club that establishes an alternate universe... ish!
