## Sinopse

When 10-year-old Kaneda Shota was involved in a car accident that claimed the life of his father, it changed the course of his life forever. Even though his mother got a job and tried her best to support her son, money was always tight. Now, unable to afford college, Shota works a part-time job, in addition to his full-time job at his uncle's factory. He dreams of one day saving enough money to go to college. He lives alone, on the second floor of one of his uncle's warehouses, and doesn't have any friends. Everywhere he goes, he rides a bicycle, with headphones to block out the flashback-inducing sounds of the cars.
