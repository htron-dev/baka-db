She has even been told by the club adviser to help out Yokoyama, a member who can't swim, because she's good at teaching others how to swim. She is also a close friend to Jun, another swimming club member. What will happen to these three?\n\n(Source: Intercross)\n\nIncluded one-shots: S no Kaikata, Ano Natsu, Bokura wa",
