## Sinopse

Torigoe, a classmate of mine I never really liked, and I ended up together as members of the school festival executive committee. He's always gotten more girls than I have because of his clear-cut appearance and sharp mind and, since he has a bad attitude, I've never had any intention to get along with him! But then, I got hooked on his cute and hard-working side, so I have no choice but to push forward!

Impulsive mood-maker Iida's and unfriendly beauty Torigoe's awkward love.
