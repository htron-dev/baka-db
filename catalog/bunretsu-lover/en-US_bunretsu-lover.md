## Sinopse

In this world, people suffer from "Splitting Syndrome." When one holds back their emotions or desires too much, they pass out and a clone that acts out on their true feelings splits off from them. Makoto, a high school student, fears that his inability to confess to his classmate Shion will cause him to split, so he lets out his feelings when no one is looking. Shion is well known for being so perfect that she's never split before, but one day she suddenly passes out right in front of Makoto, and her clone tries to do naughty things with him! What will Makoto do now that he knows her true feelings, with Shion herself none the wiser?
