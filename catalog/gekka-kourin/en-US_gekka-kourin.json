    "sinopse": "Reira Bandou is an ordinary, average college student—or so she thinks, until a group of strangers tell her she is the reincarnation of Ashura, the Buddhist god of war and a member of the Hachi Bushu. The remaining members of their group must be found so they can defeat the demons that threaten the world. Reira struggles to control her powers and regain Ashura’s memories, and it only gets more complicated when another Hachi Bushu member makes a shocking claim—that he and Reira are lovers!\n\n(Source: DMG)",
