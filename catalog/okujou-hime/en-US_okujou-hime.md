## Sinopse

Mayu and Nobu have been best friends ever since they where kids, always the best buddies. Along with them is the other childhood friend, introverted Yuiko who always has been some sort of damsel who the boys have always helped. Upon entering high school the trio meet the daughter of the chairman, the student council president nicknamed "The Rooftop Princess" and who is considered a perfect girl in every sense.

Yuiko gets into trouble with a skirt chaser and the Rooftop Princess helps her out without asking anything in return, Yuiko quickly develops a strong admiration for the princess and from that point on Mayu will also admire the Princess but in a completely different way than Yuiko.

These 4 people will be the center of a lovely high school romance drama.
