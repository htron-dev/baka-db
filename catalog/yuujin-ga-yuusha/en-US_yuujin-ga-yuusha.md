## Sinopse

The setting is back in the Dark Ages when the world lived in fear of the Demon King. That is until a Hero appeared who could save the world and its helpless people. The Hero gathered a party and seeks to bring love and justice to the troubled land. But the world’s a dangerous place–there’s all sorts of monsters, traps, poisonous mushrooms… when the Hero falls to these dangers, he goes to heaven and meets with a friendly NPC shepard.
