    "sinopse": "A hopeless geek, a beautiful woman, and a fast connection--could the Internet be his ticket onto the express train to romance?\n\nA real-life thread on an Internet forum sparks a nationwide phenomenon! A nerdy otaku meets a girl on a train and posts an urgent query on the Web. How the heck do you talk to girls? What should he wear on their date? Where should they go? The forum's response was overwhelming, and the thread continued to grow along with their relationship.\n\nEventually published in book form to become a best-seller, the thread spawned a blockbuster movie and hit TV series, as well as this heartwarming manga adaptation of an entire Internet community rooting for love and romance.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
