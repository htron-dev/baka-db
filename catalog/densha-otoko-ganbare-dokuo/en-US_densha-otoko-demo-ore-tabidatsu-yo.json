    "sinopse": "Perpetual geek, social basket case and obsessive fan—needless to say, the guy called \"Train Man\" has never had a girlfriend. Most of his days are spent immersed in electronics and waiting for the box set DVD of his favorite anime series. But fate takes a turn for Train one ordinary night on an ordinary train ride. He falls in love at first sight with Hermess, a gorgeous fellow passenger. When a drunken rider tries to harass her, Train surprises himself by coming to her rescue. But when Hermess later contacts Train with a thank you give and the possibility of further contact, that's one situation he can't handle. He immediately goes online to a popular chat room to solicit advice. To his horror, he's encouraged to ask her out. Soon he is bombarded with advice regarding how, when and where he should do it. Will Train Man find true love, or will all this pressure to come out of his shell be too much for him to take?\n\n(Source: CMX)",
