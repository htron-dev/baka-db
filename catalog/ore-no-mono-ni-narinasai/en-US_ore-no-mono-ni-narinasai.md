## Sinopse

The brutish, possessive love story of a super model starved for true love?!

I am the amazing, extremely popular model of Karisuma Models, KEI (Toudou Kei). I would like my roommate, and ineloquent cousin, Nanami, to be my lover! He walks around, pretending he’s really badass, but he’s a worrier at heart, and whenever I see him like that, or showing this awkward kindness that he has, I just love him, love him, love him…I’ve tried to seduce him more than once. But there’s a reason he won’t take me seriously?!
