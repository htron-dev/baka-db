The time period is during Bakumatsu. Ryouma Sakamoto, a leading figure during the Meiji Restoration, is about to be killed... When he awoke, he found himself in an unknown place. The young man calling out to him looks unreliable at first glance... But it turns out that young man was Napoleon Bonaparte!

Can Ryouma light a revolutionary spirit within Napoleon? Ryouma's skills will be put to the test!!\n\n(Source: Shueisha, translated)",
