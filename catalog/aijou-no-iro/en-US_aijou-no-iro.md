## Sinopse

Ryu Sugahara's story collection has everything for the hormonal fangirl- pleasant art, ample sex scenes and cute characters. The titular story focuses on the relationship between Matsuoka and Nagase, two street-urchins who meet each other at the garbage-dump one day. Fluffiness abound with an occasional dose of angst.
