    "sinopse": "Left with memories of a past life, Ewey was born into the artisan noble family of Nylle. However, after it was determined she did not possess the ability to make \"Divine Protection Embroidery,\" she was exploited and spent her days in a living hell. By chance, she was picked up as a seamstress by the kind-hearted nobleman, Roden Kalosthylla. Grateful to Roden, she used the \"Divine Protection Embroidery\" she'd never shown her family, and made him sachet as a present. Adding in the power of the \"spirits\" she'd always interacted with, the sachet she finished became an item on the level of a national treasure, and Ewey's life takes yet another welcome turn.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
