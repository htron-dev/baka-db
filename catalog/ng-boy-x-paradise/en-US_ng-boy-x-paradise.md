## Sinopse

Miu is an average high school girl who lives in a fantasy world dreaming about the day she'll find her destined one, just like in the manga stories she reads. What she doesn't know is that her prince might be closer than she thought. One day after getting punished to run around the school, she gets hit by a motorcycle at the school gate, and when she sees its a guy she thinks its her so awaited prince. But later she'll find out a secret about this guy and his twin brother.
