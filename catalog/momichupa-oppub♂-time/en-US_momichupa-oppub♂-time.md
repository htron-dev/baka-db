## Sinopse

Naoto Shimada is a yes man, a person who never says no to anything, who just got fired since he was asked to take the blame. On the other hand, His friend from college, Takeru Yamashita, is successful and well-liked among his peers. Takeru knows a friend who runs a sex shop who is looking for a well-built man, so he recommends Naoto, who needs the money.
