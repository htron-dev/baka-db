## Sinopse

Rey Yan was an orphan with no home, no skills, and no purpose. But when he comes upon the PaSa sword, a cursed blade made from the bones of the demon king, he suddenly finds himself with the power to be a great hero. The sword's creator is the evil Shiyan, the royal vizier who needs the sword to assist him in releasing his ancestor, the demon king. (Source: Tokyopop)
