## Sinopse

The daughter of a glass artisan family, Fukami Touko, spends relaxed days at a cafe called "Kazemichi" at a friend's house. On the summer vacation of her third year in high school. In front of them appeared a transfer student boy: Okikura Kakeru. He told Touko that he can hear the voices of the future. If someone knew in advance what their future would look like, what would they wish for? While feeling never-before-felt tremors in herself, Touko realises that she has started getting a feeling in her heart which she can't leave alone...
