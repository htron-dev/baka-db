## Sinopse

In a certain school, there exists a bloody history: 10 years ago, several students were brutally and mysteriously murdered. Rumor has it that it was the work of the "Book of Demise," a collection of urban legends and tall tales. Inside this book, it is said that the "Bookmark of Demise" turns the page it rests on into reality.

Four rumor-loving friends—A-ya, an antisocial boy who relishes starting such rumors; B-ko, a popular girl who acts polite around others; C-ta, a level-headed boy who is A-ya's childhood friend; and D-ne, a quiet and introverted girl—at this school have discovered how to acquire the Book of Demise. Performing the ritual, they become part of the Demise Game—but realize too late that they are in over their heads.

To escape this game, they must weed out a traitor among them. However, at the same time, the Bookmark of Demise is turning urban legend to reality, revealing an eerie connection to the events of 10 years ago and creating a living nightmare of lies and betrayal.
