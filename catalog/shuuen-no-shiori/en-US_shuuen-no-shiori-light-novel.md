## Sinopse

Due to a single traitor, the game has begun. Those that wish to escape must abide by the terms and reach the end. Now, let this fun Demise Game begin―

One-Man Hide and Seek, Doppelgangers, Mearry-san's Messages, Monkey's Hand... A group of four boys and girls become involved with a certain game though the "Bookmark of Demise," a taboo that is said to have been brought back from ten years prior. Carry out the "demand" written in the mysterious letter, and perform the urban legends. Otherwise, you will die.
