## Sinopse

Popular Paltube personality Yuuga Mikado is so good at games—even the ones he's never played before—that he's earned the nickname "Ace of Games!" Encouraged by his best friend and fellow Paltuber Ranma, he decides to give the Buddyfight game a shot, and lands himself the ultimate buddy, Gargantua Dragon! A new adventure begins for the Ace of Games and Deity of Combat!
