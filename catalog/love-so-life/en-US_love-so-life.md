## Sinopse

Shiharu Nakamura is a high school girl who loves children, lives in an orphanage, and aspires to run a daycare. She works part-time at a nursery school where the cute two-year-old twins Akane and Aoi Matsunaga attend. One day, a handsome young man named Seiji Matsunaga comes rushing to pick up the twins, but they refuse to go home with him, clinging onto Shiharu instead. Shocked by the children's strong attachment to Shiharu, Seiji urgently requests for her to babysit them, offering to pay twice the amount she currently earns at the daycare. Shiharu realizes the cash will cover her living and schooling expenses while also providing the experience she needs to fulfill her dream.

Love So Life follows the happy days of Shiharu as she finds herself falling in love with her makeshift family, and the twins as they live out their early childhood playing, learning, and growing.
