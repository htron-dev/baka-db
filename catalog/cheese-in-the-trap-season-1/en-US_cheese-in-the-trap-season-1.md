## Sinopse

Having returned to college after a year long break, Hong Sul, a hard-working over-achiever, inadvertently got on the wrong side of a suspiciously perfect senior named Yu Jeong. From then on her life took a turn for the worse and Sul was almost certain it was all Yu Jeong's doing. So why is he suddenly acting so friendly a year later?
