## Sinopse

Cat-like Tama is easy-going, cute, but not upfront. Dog-like Pochi is cool and devoted. Tama, watched over closely by Pochi, is healed and worries, falls in love and into heat (laugh)—he's very busy!? Roommates, newlyweds, see the explosive popularity of their lovey-dovey daily lives! A healing comedy which will make you 120% happier in difficult times!
