## Sinopse

From Midnight Scans:

Eri is a normal high school student, who feels satisfied with her life, if there are Red Tea and sweets around. However, fate plays a trick on her, and she is assigned to learn the art of making tea from Secret Garden’s #1 butler, Ijuuin!! Mr. Butler’s lesson is exciting and strict, and, sometimes… pleasantly perverted?!
