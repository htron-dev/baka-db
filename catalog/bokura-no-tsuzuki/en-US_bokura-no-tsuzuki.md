## Sinopse

High school students Yousuke and Shuu have become somewhat estranged due to an accident early in their childhood. However, their relationship is restored when Shuu moves to the shopping district Yousuke resides in, to stay at his grandmother's place. Yousuke, although awkward at first, starts feeling stirred by the expressions and mannerisms that the usually aloof Shuu only shows to him!
