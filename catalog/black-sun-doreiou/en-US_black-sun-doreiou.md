## Sinopse

Gerun Fortress, under the command of Officer Leonard de Limbourg, is attacked by the prestigious general Jemaru Jan of the Middle Eastern Empire. With no hope of winning, Leonard offers his head in exchange for the safety of any survivors left in the fortress. But Jemaru isn't into executions, and torturing prisoners of war is much more interesting. Forced to sleep with a man that is his enemy, Leonard's feelings of shame overtake his mind, but lust overtakes his body...
