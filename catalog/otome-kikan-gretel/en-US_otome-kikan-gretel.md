## Sinopse

Mikoshima Yuu is ecstatic to be entering into a all-girl world at St. Millefeuille Gakuen. Mariya is annoyed that she's been assigned to show the newbie around. But Nagi volunteers to escort her - in fact, she's positive frantic to do so, and immediately starts to court Yuu, who is thrown off her stride when she's so openly being pursued by a beautiful girl.
