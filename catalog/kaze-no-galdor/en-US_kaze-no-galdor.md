## Sinopse

From Wingtip Cafe:
A collection of 2 fantasy stories with a rich sense of celtic folklore. The first story, “On the riverbank of Lethe” tells a strange encounter of a memory-lost amazon warrior and a mysterious bard with a broken-string unicorn-shaped harp. The Second story with the same title of the book, is about the bard’s past when he first met his red-headed amazon princess.
