## Sinopse

The story is set to Edo, in the time of the Great Earthquake. To regain her lost "power", Yurika goes to find Tasuke, a painter.

Tasuke is a novice artist who's gotten himself into a bit of trouble with debt. When it looks like that trouble is going to cost him his life, he cries out to the gods to save him! In response, he acquires a supernatural paintbrush/girl in a sailor outfit.
