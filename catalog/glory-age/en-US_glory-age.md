## Sinopse

From the outset, the plot seems to be the typical story of a half-angel, half-human boy with incredible powers (sealed in this case until his human form dies), but in the great Na Yeri style, intrigue and mysteries abound. Little Savian can see angels and devils; in fact, he can touch them and in some instances affect them in powerful ways. Low-rank angels Thunder and Panuel discover his ability as well as the devil Jarob who tries to break the seal on Savian, and for a moment, Savian becomes a golden-eyed nephilim... But then, his human form seals him back...?!
