    "sinopse": "Probably one of the most difficult feats in manga is to tell a compelling short story, and Mitsuru Adachi is a master of the medium. This selection of some of his best short works include two tales in the dangerous life of a pretty private-eye-to-be; a boy's stop-off on the way changes his life's destination; five short-shorts in a quirky cafe; Japan's future ace pitcher can't even throw a ball; when a school play goes bad, the world is a stage for love and karate; a drama of rugby and past lives; two off-beat time-travel tales; and more! Mitsuru Adachi's low-key but high-impact stories are a must read for any manga aficionado.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\n1. Haru ga Kuru Mae ni... (Before Spring Comes)\n2.
