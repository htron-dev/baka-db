    "sinopse": "Nostradamus prophesied that the world would end in the seventh month of 1999. Today is July 21, 1999. Ever since she was little, Maruyama Sakura has put her faith in this prophecy, and believed she will die at age 19. Consequently, nothing has seemed all that important to her. As the final days of her final month tick down, Sakura is whiling away the last of her time. Then Sakura meets Mori. She has ten days until the end of the world.\n\n(Source: Kissmanga)",
