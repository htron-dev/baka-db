Do you take the train on a regular basis? Compare your experiences with those of the characters peopling the nine shorts that make up Platonic Form, from a 9-to-5'er who struggles daily during rush hour, to someone suffering from unrequited love, to a busy homemaker, a stubborn boss, a diligent high school student.
