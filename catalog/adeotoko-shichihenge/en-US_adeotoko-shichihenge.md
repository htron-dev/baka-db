## Sinopse

Misono has a secret... she's a yakuza's daughter! In order to cover up her background, she has attended a famous private school with her seemingly "plain" assistant/boyfriend Yuuki. Although they are lovers, things are going nowhere in their relationship, how can Misono take the relationship to the next level when her boyfriend acts too much like a servant?
