## Sinopse

All I wanted is an ordinary life with everything being ordinary. That is all I wanted. But thanks to my dad (a lovely gangster), I don't get to live an ordinary life. So all I wanted is ONE thing. I wanted to be like other girls my age and have a normal school life. But what should I do when I get a fiance who is gorgeous and has a dirty personalty?!
