    "sinopse": "Tadasu Seiji is in charge of the temple in a small town at the age of 17 and he is surprised when he learns that he has a niece named Madoka M. Frandoll from the US and that she will be living with him from now on. Madoka is a genius inventor that tends to be lazy and who designs and builds some of the most sophisticated yet dangerous machines of our time. Seiji thought his life could not get more chaotic but when Madoka brings Chimaki, a young girl who lost her memory and has the mob looking for her, things get really out of control.\n\n(Source: MU)",
