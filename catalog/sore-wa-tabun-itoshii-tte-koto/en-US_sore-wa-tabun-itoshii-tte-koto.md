## Sinopse

Kumagaya gave up his dream of becoming an athlete and found himself a job as a mover. At his workplace, he reunites with Ino, a schoolmate from high school. As usual, Ino is capable though arrogant, and is a weird guy that hides the fact that he dotes on a hamster. Kumagaya didn't want to have anything to do with the people who knows the past him, but for some reason, Ino likes to get involved with him…?!

A clashing love with two disagreeable fellows.
