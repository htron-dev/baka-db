## Sinopse

On June 2, 1582, in the late Sengoku period, the great hero Oda Nobunaga is almost reaching his ambition to unify Japan. He came one step closer to his dream but was killed by Akechi Mitsuhide in the Honno-ji Incident. However, Nobunaga's burning "ambition" is far more stronger than the flame surrounding him! True story begins now.

Here is a comic version of KOEI's best selling game "Nobunaga's Ambition" to celebrate its 30th anniversary! Nobunaga was supposed to be dead at the Honno-ji Incident, but he comes back. When he wakes up, he is in the mountain camp on his way to the Mino attacking which occured 20 years before the Honno-ji Incident. Already knows about subsequent evens, how Nobunaga stands against "the history"? Is Nobunaga's ambition fulfilled?
