    "sinopse": "Welcome to Kaya, a world where dragons shape people's lives. Some people, hunters, make a living by slaying them. Others, shamans, control them with incantations. Seur-Chong is a hunter with the Dragon's Curse, a condition which gives him incredible strength and stamina, but is slowly killing him. A mercenary, he cares only for money. But as he becomes enmeshed in the intrigue surrounding those who hire the hunters, he finds himself fighting for a cause more noble than anything he'd ever imagined. Of course if he's lucky, he just might come away with a profit and a cure to his curse, as well...\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
