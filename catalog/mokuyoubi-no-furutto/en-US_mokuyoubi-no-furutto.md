## Sinopse

Furutto is a cat that leads a double life. On one hand, he's the companion of a young woman in an apartment building named Kujirai, who feeds him (when she hasn't gambled away her meager manga-assistant's paycheck) and spends time with him in her apartment. On the other hand, he wants to keep his street cred as a stray cat and spends a good amount of time hanging out with the other strays, trying to steal food out of trash cans and rumbling with the cats from the next town over.
