    "sinopse": "This is a sweet and heartwarming love story, told from the different viewpoint of the two young lovers, a girl named Chizuru and a boy named Yudai. They mean well but cannot seem to succeed at love. They want their relationship to succeed but a combination of uneasiness and lack of self-confidence keeps them from advancing to the next step.\n\nSometimes, it takes an unexpected third party to intervene in order to make two people realize what is right in front of them. That is exactly what happens in this story. (Source: M-U)",
