    "sinopse": "Junya still has Kyouichi’s handkerchief from a long time ago when they met. But now, after their parents got married to one another, they meet again this time as step-brothers. Junya wants to return the handkerchief, but isn’t sure that Kyouichi remembers him or that fateful night. Junya also has unusual pains that suddenly develop and the only one he can contact is Kyouichi. Are these pains just an excuse to be able to touch his step-brother?\n\n(Source: MU)",
