Unfortunately the Professor meets a horrifying fate and is sent plummeting back to Earth.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the Professor's fate are far too suspicious to ignore and his son, a student in biological science, decides to get to the bottom of the controversy himself.\n\nProfessor Uetsuto's devious rival, Professor Dorai, has other plans though and will stop at nothing to ensure the mystery of Professor Uetsuto's \"demise\" remains a secret.\n\nPublished in 1957 by Togetsu books, this was Mizuki Shigeru's very first Manga.",
