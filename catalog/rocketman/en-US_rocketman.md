## Sinopse

When a 2nd moon suddenly looms overs Japan, the brave Professor Uetsuto volunteers to take a rocket up to the mysterious moon to investigate. Unfortunately the Professor meets a horrifying fate and is sent plummeting back to Earth.

The circumstances surrounding the Professor's fate are far too suspicious to ignore and his son, a student in biological science, decides to get to the bottom of the controversy himself.

Professor Uetsuto's devious rival, Professor Dorai, has other plans though and will stop at nothing to ensure the mystery of Professor Uetsuto's "demise" remains a secret.

Published in 1957 by Togetsu books, this was Mizuki Shigeru's very first Manga.
