    "sinopse": "Kamisu Iori is at that age when he really wants a girl, but he's about to get more than he bargained for. Iori is taking a nap in the forest when a cute girl with cat ears and tail falls on him from the trees. She scurries away and he chases her through a mysterious door somewhere in the forest. Iori wakes up in a café where he learns that kittens actually take the form of a human with cat ears and tail just like Keena, the cute girl he was chasing. But when he accidentally breaks the door that he came through, Iori has to work at the café surrounded by \"kittens\" until it gets fixed and he can go home.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)\n\nThis series is on hiatus.",
