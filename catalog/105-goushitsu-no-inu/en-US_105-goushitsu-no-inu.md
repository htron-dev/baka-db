## Sinopse

When he was younger, Takeshi promised to come to the aid of a "cute girl" in his calligraphy class that he had a crush on. Since then he has never strayed from Mako's side. Mako sees Takeshi as "cute as a stupid dog". Add in third wheel friend Honda, along with many other typical plots for a school romance and you have a story.
