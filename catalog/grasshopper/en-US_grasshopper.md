## Sinopse

Suzuki, who was once a law-abiding teacher, joins a criminal organization called Reijou in order to avenge his murdered wife. But his attempt is thwarted by mysterious man who comes to be known as the "Pusher" because he shoves the criminal into the path of an oncoming car. Suzuki decides to pursue the Pusher. This mystery man is also being pursued by two other hit men; the knife-wielder Cicada and the assassin Whale, whose family is in the business of making people commit suicide. The story is written from the points of view from these three people and ultimately relates how their fates are intertwined.
