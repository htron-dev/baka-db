## Sinopse

Shy Niina Nijikawa loves to sing, but hates to perform—the thought of an audience scares her speechless—which leaves her dreams of being an idol dead in the water. But when a classmate introduces her to the world of VR, her world opens up... and she finds that becoming an idol—a VR idol—is within her reach after all!
