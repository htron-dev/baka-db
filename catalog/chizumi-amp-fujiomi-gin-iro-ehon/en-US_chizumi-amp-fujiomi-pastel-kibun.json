    "sinopse": "Chizumi, now a college student but still as clumsy as ever, continues to experience new feelings and situations. First, she becomes the target of a gang -- but even gang leaders have feelings. Next, she and Fujiomi begin tutoring and some romantic rivals pop up. Chizumi is like a child's pastel scribbles to Fujiomi's ink sketch, but as long as the two care for each other their relationship stays strong.\n\nAlso included is a short story about the couple before they met.",
