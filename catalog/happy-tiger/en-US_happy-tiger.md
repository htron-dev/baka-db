## Sinopse

The story of a young, happy-go-lucky Japanese officer over the course of World War II. In 1940, he goes to Mongolia to help a nomadic family who rescued him during the Soviet-Japanese War of 1939. He decides to live with his Mongolian friends, but he is accidentally conscripted into the Red Army. At the Battle of Moscow in 1941 he becomes a prisoner of war of the Germans, but eventually is allowed to join the Waffen-SS, in which he becomes a Tiger tank crewman. And that's just the start of his adventures...
