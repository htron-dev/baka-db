## Sinopse

An orphan named Aisya has been gifted the incredible power to make paintings that perform miracles just by using her blood. She and her best friend Loki have a wonderful time together, despite her deteriorating health. However, Loki realizes that he's nothing more than Aisya's drawing when he tries to save Aisya one night from an attacker. Aisya sends him on a quest to destroy her paintings and her curse, and to save the people changed by them, but can Loki look past his hatred of humans in order to carry out her wish?
