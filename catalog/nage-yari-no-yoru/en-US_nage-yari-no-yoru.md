## Sinopse

Yoshino can’t help liking his co-worker Murai, even though he knows he’s straight and will never return his feelings. Meanwhile, Hashimoto, the new guy in the department, is crazy about Yoshino, even though Yoshino never gives him anything but a hard time. Hashimoto will try everything he can think of to make Yoshino forget his unrequited love and fall for him instead.
