    "sinopse": "In elementary school, Hideki, Mahiro, Mike, and Souma always played together as make-believe heroes. Mike would be the villain, Souma the hostage, Mahiro the sidekick/police girl, and Hideki the hero. Though these childhood friends drifted apart over the years, they reunite at a mutual acquaintance's wedding. Now adults, Mahiro, Mike, and Souma start going out for drinks together from time to time. But, Hideki misses their meetups every time, much to Mahiro's disappointment. That is, until Mahiro catches Hideki stalking his coworker! Why is Hideki following Mahiro's coworker and why is he trying to recruit Mahiro to help him? This volume also includes stories about Mike and Souma, two roommates without benefits...for now.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
