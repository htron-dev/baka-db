## Sinopse

Uruno started as an intern in a programming company where the person he's interested in, his senior, Hongo, works at. While Uruno is skeptical about love matters, he finds himself drawn to Hongo every time he spends with him. All in all, Uruno was fine with the way things are. But when Hongo transfers out, Uruno is left hollow and indifferent. When news of Hongo's company being booted out reaches Uruno, he is persistent in finding Hongo. He succeeds in finding Hongo, now jobless and homeless, with only his drones for company. Desperate to keep Hongo by his side, Uruno offers to buy Hongo for $50,000.
