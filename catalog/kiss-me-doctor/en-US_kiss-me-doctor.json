Kaho is pretty transparent in her adoration of the good doctor. See hangs all over him. Tsukishiro-sensei is a cool, stone-faced guy. His personality is very serious. He patiently puts up with Kaho’s antics, but the jealous nurses at the hospital are not as tolerant. Is Kaho just feeling girlish infatuation, or is it true love? And how does the doctor really feel behind his serious mask?\n\nStory 2:\nOohishi Midori, one very determined and talented girl, wants to become an actress. She knows what she wants, and takes a great approach to get there… Then she meets a cute producer, who is swayed by her determination.

Midori is great at acting, and everyone is impressed with her talent, but when a kiss scene comes up, she gets nervous. Fortunately the producer is willing to help coach her. Is there something more than a boss and worker relationship?\n\nStory 3:\nMiyagawa Yuki who is in love with her teacher, and even manages to give him some Valentine’s Day chocolate to confess her love to him.
