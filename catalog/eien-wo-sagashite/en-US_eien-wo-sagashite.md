After her beloved mother's death, Honor faced a lifetime of loneliness... In the presence of others, she holds back her tears and strives to keep her mother's restaurant going, but her tears won't stop flowing when she is alone. "Are you alright?" a kind voice asks. The voice belongs to a man named Trace. Even though they have never met, Honor is comforted by his gentle eyes and warm hands. She is quickly drawn to this man, until she finds out the brutal truth. Trace befriended her for a purpose. Not only that, Honor begins to discover the secret behind her own birth...
