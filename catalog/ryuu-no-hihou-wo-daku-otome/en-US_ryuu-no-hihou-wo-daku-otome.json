    "sinopse": "Part 6 of the De Burgh series.\n\nThe sixth brother of the de Burgh family, Reynold, is determined to leave the Campion castle. Seeing all his brothers get married one after another is growing painful. He knows it is impossible for him to be happy like them. The ones who come to see him off are the L'Estrange sisters, who are rumored to be witches. Their prophecy states, \"Reynold will slay the dragon and then save the damsel in distress.\" While he thinks the statement is ridiculous, the village he reaches happens to have a dragon that protects a treasure, and the beautiful daughter of the manor, Sabina, has started looking for help!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
