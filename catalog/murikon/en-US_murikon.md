## Sinopse

"It all started when a man and a woman of two feuding villages committed lovers' suicide because their love wasn't approved. Both villages then suffered from various kinds of disasters. After that, scared of the punishment, both villages would present a pair of man and woman who would then marry each other, in order to appease the wrathful spirits and avoid disasters."

Due to such legend, one night Shirakawa Momoki suddenly became Kurotaki Chikage's bride just like that. Lost to the pressure of both families, Momoki accepted his fate and wore a white kimono to start a newly-married life with a stern Chikage, whether they like it or not!! There's no chemistry whatsoever between their hearts and bodies?! A BL story about a marriage with inevitable divorce!
