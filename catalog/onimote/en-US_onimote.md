## Sinopse

Our protagonist, Outarou Kiyohime, is rather prone to getting pushed around. At the orders Nagi and Hibiki, a pair of gorgeous twins who head the student council, he goes off to ask the "Devilishly Hot Club," who are unlawfully occupying their club room, to kindly leave. But then, the club Captain, Fiolentina, falls for Outarou at first sight. She does nothing but hit on him, and he just can't get down to business! In the end, will Outarou be able to have them leave the room as per his orders? This is a soft and squishy 4-panel gag strip about a high school boy who is, for some reason, too popular with the ladies for his own good.
