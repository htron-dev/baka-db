    "sinopse": "\"Everyday, no matter what, we tell some sort of lie.\"\n\nShirose Sayo has always been mildly interested in Saeki Aoi, mainly because he's different from the other guys in her class. However, upon graduating middle school, Sayo's image of Saeki is destroyed and she finds he is not the mature young man she thought he was. A year later, they meet again by chance through a group blind date. They clear up their misunderstanding and become friends... but there's one uncomfortable issue. Saeki is in love with Mei, the girlfriend of Daichi, Sayo's older brother!\n\n(Source: Rainy Sunday)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nFutaba no Totemo Sainan na Hi, Hanayome Kashidashichuu (Bride on Loan)",
