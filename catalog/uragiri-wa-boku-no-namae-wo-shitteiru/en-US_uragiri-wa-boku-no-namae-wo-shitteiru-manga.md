## Sinopse

Plagued by re-occurring dreams he can't quite recall and a strange power that allows others' thoughts and emotions to flow into him, high school student Sakurai Yuki has always longed to know the reason for his existence. Soon after a hauntingly beautiful, nostalgic stranger named Zess saves Yuki from an oncoming car, the head of the Gioh Clan shows up at the foster group home where Yuki lives, claiming to be family. Who are the Gioh Clan? What is their connection to Zess? Most importantly, can Yuki accept his role in the destiny laid out before him?
