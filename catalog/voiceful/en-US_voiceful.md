## Sinopse

They say no one's ever heard her voice in person...

Meet Kanae, an introvert about to have her life transformed in the most unusual way—through music. Kanae's transformation begins when she accidentally bumps into Hina, an independent singer who releases her music via the Internet. As the girls become good friends, they quickly find that they've become one another's inspiration—in more ways than one!
