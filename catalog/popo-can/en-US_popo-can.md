## Sinopse

When Yasuharu bought a limited edition version of a debating simulation game, the last thing he was expecting was a beautiful video game girl named Popomi to burst out of his TV and invade his life! Too make matters worse the only thing Popomi seems to do is sit around Yasuharu’s house all day, drink beer, read manga, and cause mass havoc! Yasuharu’s peaceful life of playing video games quickly turns into a rampaging 500 pound gorilla as more video game characters come into his life. Who in the world is fixing Yasuharu’s house each time Popomi destroys it with one of her rampages? You’ll just have to read Popo Can to find out! (Source: Infinity Studios)
