Yet despite the class's enthusiasm for her, she herself takes an odd interest in a reclusive student named Nanao Nakajima, who is often bullied for allegedly lacking an actual ability. As Nana warm-heartedly grows closer to him, her actions place Nanao in a position he had always dreamed of, even if for just a brief moment...
