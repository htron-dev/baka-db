## Sinopse

"Best friends" have to go all the way! In an unexpected turn of events, Mizuki Natsukawa befriends Rei Utami, a boy who's missed every day of class due to illness. When Rei says, "I've always been watching you from the nurse's office," it sounds almost like a confession of love... but Mizuki's soon enchanted with Rei's good looks and easy-going personality. He finds himself spending more and more time with him in the nurse's office. But, all it takes is a kiss to throw their friendship into question. As things start to escalate, will Mizuki figure out why Rei's acting this way...?
