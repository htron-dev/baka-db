    "sinopse": "The engagement between Scarlet, a noblewoman from a ducal family and the Second Prince Kyle was suddenly annulled during the ball. She had been falsely accused of harassing a girl called Terenezza, daughter to a baron, whom the Prince doted on heavily. Condemned by everyone around her, forced to burden all manner of crimes, she finally decided enough was enough.\n\n\"Before I leave here, may I ask for one final thing?\"\n\nAs the crowd threw their boos and jeers, and that good looking guy flung his insults, her palm spun like a drill, and the ballroom floor was stained with blood.\n\n(Source: AlphaPolis, translated)",
