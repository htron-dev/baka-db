## Sinopse

Scarlet el Vandimion has the most unfortunate and arduous task of being engaged to Kyle von Pallistan, the second prince. Not only is he crude and arrogant, but he also bullies her to no end. For the sake of her family, Scarlet has learned to endure, keep it cool, and tolerate his childish ways.

However, with another girl hanging off his arm, Kyle breaks off his engagement with Scarlet and accuses her of evil deeds that she never committed. Even so, she is not fazed; Scarlet asks for only one final thing... Most have forgotten the nickname she earned in her childhood, but at this moment, they are all too aware. Clenching her fists, the Mad Dog Princess shows that her true passion has always been the exhilarating, heart-pumping action of violence and bloodshed.
