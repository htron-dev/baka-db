## Sinopse

Mai Kojima is a slightly ditzy 16-year-old. She's gotten her first boyfriend! They've been dating for 3 months. Even though they should be at their most lovey-dovey, they haven't been able to make out at all... That’s because her boyfriend Yu-kun is a super exam-taking student aiming for T-University. Every day is an uneasy one without much hugging or kissing. "Come on, I wanna do more lovey-dovey stuff!!"
