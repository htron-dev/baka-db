    "sinopse": "The case files of the detectives at the Shinjuku Police Station paint an unapologetic picture of the worst of human nature, the horrors of everyday life, and the people that are the products of it. In this society, abused children grow up twisted, and traumatized victims turn to violence for revenge. The line between victim and criminal is often blurred when even the worst offenders are those society once failed to save. Left behind in the passing of the years, former detective Ida Kyouya must once more pick up his gun.\n\n(Source: Storm in Heaven)",
