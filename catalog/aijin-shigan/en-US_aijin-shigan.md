## Sinopse

My life was laid out peaceful and predictable before me...so how did I end up here?

Mercy has a quiet, unassuming life in the small English village where she was born. Engaged to a frugal yet polite man, she believes that her peaceful life will continue from here on out...that is, until her best friend returns from London and turns everyone on their head! Her friend's wedding is an extravagant affair, very different from anything Mercy has ever known. But then the bride goes into a panic when a handsome man with cold eyes appears. She says that this man, Croft, is here to ruin the wedding. Rushing to her friend's rescue, Mercy tries to distract the man...and ends up ruining her own life instead!
