On her first day, she musters up the courage to greet one of her classmates, Kotori, only to witness him fist-fight upperclassmen. Seeing the fight, Hane faints and is readmitted to the hospital, and while she's recovering, Kotori surprisingly comes to visit her. Could this delinquent be more than meets the eye?",
