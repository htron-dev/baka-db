## Sinopse

Midori, Momoko, and Shiho are friends in high school. Momoko is in the art club, Shiho is in the swimming club, and Midori has a hobby of searching out bizarre things. One day, Midori finds a new cafe for them to go to—a weird 'space' cafe with an owner who wears an astronaut helmet! The three of them pass their days together, encountering plenty of strange situations along the way.
