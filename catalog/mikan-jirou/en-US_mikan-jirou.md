## Sinopse

Once upon a time, an orange fell from the sky into a young lady's hands. As she peeled the orange, she discovered a tiny boy inside. Overjoyed, she named him Mikan Jirou and took him home, where they lived happily together as a family...or so the story should go, but why then is Mikan Jirou on a journey with a frog who claims to be a royal prince who was cursed by a witch? A comedic twist on the famous Japanese folk-tale "Momotarou."
