## Sinopse

Beth, the manager of a riding academy, comes to Egypt to buy her dream horse. She finds the ideal horse, but it's out of her price range. Soon after, Beth ends up traveling to a castle owned by Moroccan prince Uzziah. Beth stays with Uzziah in the hopes of obtaining one of the first-rate horses he raises, but she doesn't realize that the real reason he invited her to his castle was so that he could seduce her into his bed!
