## Sinopse

Narcissistic Seiiji Agou believed that no other beauty could move his heart until he accidentally ran into the gentle and charming Narumi Maimoto. Maimoto hinted that they would meet again, but before that happens Agou suddenly got cursed by a girl stalker! Not knowing what his curse is, Agou walked to the class and met Maimoto who just got transferred. However, he does not seem to recognize Agou's face even though they met only yesterday!

Annoyed Agou walked to the bathroom only to realize that he had lost his precious beauty. Well, thankfully he doesn't turn "ugly" in everyone's eyes, just in the eyes of the subject of his affection. Eh? Does that mean... Love is beautiful, but it doesn't have to be beautiful to be Love! Agou and His Curse is undeniably an adorable youthful BL that will make your heart flutter!
