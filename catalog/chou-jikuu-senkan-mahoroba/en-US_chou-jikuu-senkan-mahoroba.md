## Sinopse

Yo Haguro, a recurring character of Leiji Matsumoto's mangas, works as a secretary onboard the luxury cruiser ship, "Revenge of Earth." On this ship, World War II is still happening, as people onboard still have issues with the conclusion of the original conflict. When Toshiro Oyama, a photographer and son of a WWII photographer, starts working on the ship after being contacted by Yo, he soon realizes that there's more than one unusal ship, when "Revenge of Earth" is being tracked down by the ghost battleship called Mahoroba.
