    "sinopse": "After half a year, he’s finally forgotten about the man who’d spurned him so harshly… After half a year, he’s finally found himself a new boyfriend.\n\nYet, at that very moment, right in front of Izumi Morida’s eyes, his ex-lover, Tomoya Shinguji appeared again. However, as the result of an accident, Tomoya has lost every single memory about Izumi. And the gentle Tomoya has also changed completely, into an arrogant, domineering man. He abducted Izumi, and on top of that, he even tied him up and violated him forcibly. Never had Izumi imagined Tomoya would be such a sadist!\n\nAlthough he kept resisting, his heart, lingering with the recollection of the old Tomoya, still trembled… A lust swirling, violent love!\n\n(Source: MU)",
