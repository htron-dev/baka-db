    "sinopse": "Midori's mother has finally acquired her dream home, but it isn't long before supernatural phenomena disrupt the peace of the family. And if unexplained electricity failures, strange phone calls, and the eerie presence of spirits weren't enough, finding unexplainable blood in the bathroom becomes the last straw. Mai and Shibuya Psychic Research are brought in to investigate, but what horrors will they find in the 'dream' home that turns out to be nothing but a nightmare?\n\n(Source: Wonderland After Hours)",
