## Sinopse

The happiness of the royal family of Edenbourg, waiting for a baptismal ceremony of the king's first grandchild, is broken by bad news - the king has been in a traffic accident. Princess Dominique runs to the site in search of her father, accompanied by the family's High Counsel, Marcus Kent, who offers to escort her. Her heart races, as she has admired Marcus since childhood, but he abuses her respect with harsh words.
