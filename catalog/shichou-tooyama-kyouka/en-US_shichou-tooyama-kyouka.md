## Sinopse

Tooyama Kyouka has just been elected mayor of Hanahama City. In addition to being only the fourth female in the country's history to serve as mayor, she is a best selling mystery author, a loving wife, and a working mother. While accomplishing all of the normal administrative duties required of her office, she listens carefully to her constituents' voices and readily addresses their concerns in what many consider unconventional ways.
