## Sinopse

It's been a year since Mamiya opened up his Italian restaurant at a coastal resort. Stocking up on top-class ingredients from a fisherman named Oosuga and an herb garden owner named Eiji, his restaurant has skyrocketed. Then one night, Mamiya happens to see a lover's quarrel between Oosuga and Eiji, and he begins to plan an intervention.
