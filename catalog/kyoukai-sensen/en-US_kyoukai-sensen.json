    "sinopse": "Collection of five short stories.\n\nTokyo has been reduced to rubble, and the paralyzed government is slowly reforming elsewhere. Unable to cope with the disaster during its reformation, the government simply put up a blockade around Tokyo and left the survivors to cope with the violent and lawless society forming within the borders. These are the stories of those survivors. Some of them want to cross the border and find their way back to civilization, but some simply want to live as they like within the anarchy of the ruins of Tokyo.\n\n(Source: MU)",
