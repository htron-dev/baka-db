## Sinopse

They say that the prime of one's career happens in their mid-thirties. During that time, women plan many things and tell themselves, "I won't let this year go by without doing anything!"

And then, a 34 year-old's life begins, hearing a new vacuum cleaner hum in the night shifts her moods as the Galactic Railroad runs in her mind...

Shall we take a look at an unemployed's slow, laid-back daily life?
