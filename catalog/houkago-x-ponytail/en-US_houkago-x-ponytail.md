## Sinopse

Natsuki, an otaku high-school girl who'd much rather spend her money on manga than pretty dresses, accidentally injures a creepy-looking mangaka Kiritani Taichi. To repay him, she agrees to be his character model until he fully heals. Kiritani-san turns out to be popular shoujo mangaka Ichijou Kiriko, who is also Natsuki's favourite author! What will become of these two?
