    "sinopse": "18-year-old old Mai Sugimoto is a college student starting this year. She was looking forward to the \"college life,\" but she ends up living with two women because of a realtor's mistake. Furthermore, they are all 18-years-old and share the exact same name, Mai Suigimoto. Hence a life story of three Mai(s) full of fun and erotic excitement begins. Can these three girls get along? Perhaps even become friends, only time will tell in Mai's Room.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Gemini\nVolume 3: Jouji no Shita",
