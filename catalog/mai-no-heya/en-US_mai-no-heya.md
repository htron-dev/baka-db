## Sinopse

18-year-old old Mai Sugimoto is a college student starting this year. She was looking forward to the "college life," but she ends up living with two women because of a realtor's mistake. Furthermore, they are all 18-years-old and share the exact same name, Mai Suigimoto. Hence a life story of three Mai(s) full of fun and erotic excitement begins. Can these three girls get along? Perhaps even become friends, only time will tell in Mai's Room.
