    "sinopse": "After years of putting up with Takagi's teasing, Nishikata came to realize that her presence in his life had become irreplaceable. Now married, the days they spend together are more vibrant than ever, thanks to the antics of their mischievous daughter, Chii. Influenced by her mother, Chii has a habit of pulling pranks on her father, much to his dismay. Although Chii tries to trick her mother as well, it appears that no one in the family can beat the expert teaser at her own game.\n\nEven if the teasing competition within the Nishikata household seems never-ending, it is undeniable that their playful interactions have created precious memories for the family, and will continue to do so.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
