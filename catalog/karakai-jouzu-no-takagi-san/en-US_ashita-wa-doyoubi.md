## Sinopse

A slice of life comedy revolving around the conversations and daily shenanigans of three schoolgirls. Mina is lively and gets into mischief; Yukari is the class rep and usually follows Mina's lead; and Sanae is a member of the track club who, unlike her friends, prefers to stay cool and act rationally.
