## Sinopse

16-year-old Hako has loved music for as long as she can remember. Now, she's a songwriter and keyboardist, and she's planning on becoming a professional musician with her best friend at her all-girls high school. Her best friend, though, doesn't really share her passion for the music industry.

One day, while practicing one of her songs at a piano store, Hako comes to the attention of Ren, a boy her age who is the vocalist of his own rock band. He promptly decides that she is the element his band has been missing, and he must acquire her at all costs. How far will Ren and Hako's ambition and dedication to music be able to carry them?
