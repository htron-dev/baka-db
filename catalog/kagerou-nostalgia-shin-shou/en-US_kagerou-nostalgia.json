    "sinopse": "For centuries, the land of medieval Japan have been plagued by conflict, and the people are no strangers to suffering. Blood has been continuously shed by the swords of two power-hungry clans, and their greed has taken the lives of many soldiers. Remarkably, though, these perished soldiers have been given another chance to fight and seek revenge upon their killers. Their souls have been resurrected, housed within the bodies of an extraordinary group of teenagers, who soon realize that they must band together to once again face their enemy.",
