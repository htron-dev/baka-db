## Sinopse

Ernea, a boy who yearns after the Hero.

At the west side of the Dragon's Peak is where the dragon tribe and the dragon Men inhabit. The north side is where flying dragons are hunted, and at the south is where the Forest of Dragons is spread out and the Capital City of the kingdom which had a connection with the dragons wherein Ernea was brought up in. Before he turned 15 and set off on a journey, his everyday life was him working hard with the students of his class there.

A certain day where he needed to go to the forest of dragons for the sake of obtaining his daily food provisions is where he had a chance meeting with an ancient old dragon.

Ernea studied under the ancient old dragon and trained desperately even if he did it clumsily.

"I want to have many brides like the hero and become happy! I want a bride with a big chest! However, a bride who brandishes a blunt weapon is scary."

Ernea that grows up with his companions has gradually been dragged into the conflict of the Mazoku and the dragon men.
