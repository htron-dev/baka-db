## Sinopse

While Miura claims that the back seat of his bicycle is a reserved seat and prevents anyone from sitting there, Hase-chan is trying with all of her might to make Miho forget about his past love life. Although one sided-love might be awkward and painful, this stubborn love will not easily disappear.
