## Sinopse

Sheikh Najib blasted into Rosalind Lewis's life and staked a sultan's claim on her son! Her denial of the boy's royal lineage was met with deaf ears -- and relentless kisses. When danger threatened, mother and child were whisked into Najib's exotic world, a faraway place where protection meant marriage. But with every night in the arms of her sheikh "husband," Rosalind's secret threatened to surface. Would the truth bring a bitter end -- or a heartfelt vow?
