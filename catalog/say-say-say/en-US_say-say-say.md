## Sinopse

From HMR Scans:
No matter where you are I can recognize you at one glance whether you are disguised or far away.
Because it's our fate and destiny.

There is no other enemy like you!!
You tackle and bother me on everything I do.
Say and Yong-won are like enemies ready to attack-!!

Messed up and tangled Say’s and Yong-won’s sad but beautiful love story~♡
