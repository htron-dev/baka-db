    "sinopse": "Rena Misaki was a normal girl in high school in the small town of Otogi. But lately she has been tormented by little hamster like imps that cause greatly increased sexual desire. They had been banished from the village long ago by a priest, but somehow they have returned and have taken an interest in Rena. And if that wasn't enough trouble, they are starting to spread. Rena has to find away to get rid of them and have a normal life, before she ends up sleeping with all the guys around her!\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
