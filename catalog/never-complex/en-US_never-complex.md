## Sinopse

We met at an orphanage and grew up together. Hiro has always been following my footsteps – going to the same school, the same company, the same overseas team... He’s really like a loyal dog, always following my pace, listening and obeying everything I say or do, and helping me solve some issues. Actually, he's gifted, smart, and even more capable than me. Feeling inferior, I harshly told him, “Don’t follow me around anymore!”…

The exclusive love and dedication between the Loyal Dog and the Science Student begins!
