## Sinopse

Ei was abandoned by his lover right before Christmas. He meets a young man named Junpei and his cat (named Yakinori), who manage to soften up the serious Ei's heart. The days are getting merrier and merrier, until Ei's ex-boyfriend show up. What will Ei do?

This is a story about healing a broken heart, drawn in a very sweet way to express pure feelings.
