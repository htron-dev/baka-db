Fourteen other players (called 'birds') are all competing to kill him, in exchange for making their wishes come true. However, one of the birds, Saedano Minami, seems to have other plans. To Hidaka's confusion, she decides to protect him, but what is her ultimate goal? How will Hidaka survive this deadly game?",
