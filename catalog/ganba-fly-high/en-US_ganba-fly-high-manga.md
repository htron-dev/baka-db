## Sinopse

The boy’s gymnastics team at Heisei Middle School is an eye sore compared to the nationally renowned girls team. But Fujimake Shun, a first year, has big dreams: to win a gold at the Olympics. Unfortunately for Shun, having no experience in gymnastics and low athletic ability puts him behind even his teammates, let alone the world. But where he lacks in technical skills, he more than makes it up through determination and incredible fighting spirit that doesn’t seem to break no matter how big the obstacle.
