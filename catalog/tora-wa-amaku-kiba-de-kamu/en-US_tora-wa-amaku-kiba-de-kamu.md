## Sinopse

He's like a tiger, yet he envelopes me with such gentleness...

Misaki has always been weak in health. After being a year late for the entrance ceremony, right in the first term of school, there's a risk of her being detained a year! During the summer break she goes to school for extra classes, and it turns out that she is seated right next to Torakiba, who is rumoured to be a 'beast'! At first Misaki was really shocked, but as she got to know about Torakiba's kind side, the summer break of uncertainties slowly unveils into fun!

The clumsy, straightforward love between a problem child and a sickly child is about to begin!
