## Sinopse

"Can you see the cat?" It was with these words that the sad schoolgirl, Angelica North, first met the young man, who was an eccentric occult fiction writer. The cat in question had been following Angelica ever since her parents had burned to death a month ago, but no one else besides her seemed able to see it.

The question took him off guard, but he found that he actually was able to see the mystical cat. The cat came to him to ask for help, to protect the grieving Angelica from allowing herself to be pulled into the world of darkness.
