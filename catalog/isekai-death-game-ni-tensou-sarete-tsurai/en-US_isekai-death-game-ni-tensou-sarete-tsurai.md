## Sinopse

Tooru Himi is an office worker who has a habit of saying "I want to die" whenever he feels stressed. One fateful moment his wish was granted and now finds himself in an arena along with a group of people. They were summoned by the Death God Mei to play a death game. Only the last one standing can go back.
