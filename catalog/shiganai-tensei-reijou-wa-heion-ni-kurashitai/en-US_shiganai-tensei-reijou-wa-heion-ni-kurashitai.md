## Sinopse

Aria, a former high school girl reincarnated as an ordinary aristocratic daughter. Her meeting was arranged with Prince Eugene, rumored to be strange and eccentric. During the meeting when he reveals that in his past life he was Oda Nobunaga, Aria is convinced that this is the reason why all the other wedding arrangements for the prince went wrong. But Eugene gets curious about her when she accepts his strange story.

Thus begin Aria's day of being aggressively courted by the world's most powerful prince who's capable of unifying entire nations!
