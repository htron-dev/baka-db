Mysteriously disappeared children, an old folk legend that speaks of strange events and a monstrous creature, a strange voice...

Michio, a writer, visit Shirotoge, a small rural village dispersed in the dense mountain forests of Japan, with almost no contact with the rest of the world...and here begins the worst nightmare of his life. When the atavistic fears are realized up to shake the mind of the most rational of men, then there is no hope.
