    "sinopse": "Robbed nearly blind, Izumi is forced to move out of his apartment into more...\"affordable\" housing—which means shacking up in a run-down tenement complex with five quirky neighbors, including Haruto—the weirdest, most seemingly unsociable landlord he's ever met. Izumi's convinced all he has to do is buckle down at work and put up with this miserable situation for the time being until he saves up enough to move, but then they all kind of start to grow on him—especially (and perhaps most unexpectedly) Haruto.\n\n(Source: MangaHere)",
