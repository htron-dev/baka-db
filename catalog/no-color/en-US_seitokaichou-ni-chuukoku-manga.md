## Sinopse

High-strung Chiga finds himself questioning the results when his judo team partner, Kokusai, is elected class president of their all-boys school. A president, of course, needs a running mate - and just like that, Kokusai appoints Chiga to be his vice-president! How did a slowpoke like Kokusai win an election, anyway?! It quickly becomes clear that Chiga's major vice-presidential duty will be to keep Kokusai out of harm's way, but is he up to the task?

Author Kaori Monchi (Wagamama Kitchen) puts together a winning ticket sure to make yaoi fans cast their vote for more!
