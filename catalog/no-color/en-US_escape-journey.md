## Sinopse

In college, Naoto has an unexpected reunion with ex-boyfriend Taichi who he broke up with for denouncing him as "sexual gratification." Naoto had been firmly influenced by his hatred of this past incident but, little by little his heart is starting to forgive Taichi who has really grown when compared to their time in high school... While that's happening, their friend Fumi-chan seems to be in love with Taichi...? When they are friends, they have extraordinary compatibility, but turning it into love isn't going too well. A love story filled with emotional scars.
