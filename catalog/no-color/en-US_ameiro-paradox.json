    "sinopse": "A change in the stakeout team throws Onoe, reporter for a weekly magazine, together with his contemporary, Kaburagi, a photographer. Onoe secretly considers Kaburagi his rival, and Kaburagi's haphazard way of doing things goes against Onoe's strong sense of ethics—there's nothing but conflict between them.\n\nBut, in joint pursuit of a scandal, the two of them begin to care about each other...?\n\n(Source: Nakama)",
