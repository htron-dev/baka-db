After a fundraising dinner ends in spectacular failure, the music-loving principal decides to form a student choir as last resort. With the help of a shady talent manager named Big M, the Springfield Kindergarten Choir becomes a huge success, and little McDull discovers that a little thickness really can make a great voice.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
