## Sinopse

Shinjiro Hayata, son of Shin Hayata, who was the first Ultraman, has a natural special power. One day, Shinjiro was attacked by unknown enemies. Ultraman saved the day, and unmasked himself to show Shinjiro that he was his father. Wearing an Ultraman suit provided by Mr. Ide, formerly a member of the SSSP (Science Special Search Party), Shinjiro throws down the gauntlet and helps his father. Then the real battle commences.
