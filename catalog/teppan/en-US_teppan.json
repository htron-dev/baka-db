    "sinopse": "Currently Nihonbashi, Tokyo is being influenced by anime related material. Hence, maid cafes sprout everywhere. In this city, Rikuto (16) arrives at a place where he'll be staying which is a teppanyaki restaurant. Upon entering the first thing he sees are panties.....Yes, panties.... of the daughter who lives there, Satsuki (17). Despite the awkward first impression, Satsuki welcomes Rikuto into her home. As Rikuto enjoys the teppanyaki Satsuki made for him, a bunch of thugs enter the restaurant and attempt to force the family out for reconstruction! Satsuki resists, but one of the thugs grabs her by the neck!? What will Rikuto do to save her!?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
