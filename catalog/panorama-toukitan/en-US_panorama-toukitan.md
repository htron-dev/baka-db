## Sinopse

During the Meiji period, this story centers around an unsuccessful science fiction author who masquerades as the dead son of an industrial magnate. With his new family's riches, he creates a fantastical island to satisfy his desires.

In his manga adaptation of The Strange Tale of Panorama Island (panorama-tou kidan), Maruo strays from his usual style of explicit gore while maintaining his trademark: elaborate, elegant art.
Sprawling, overwhelming landscapes, a diverse range of uniquely designed characters, and even scenes distorted grotesquely for effect are captured with ease by the talented and experienced mangaka.
