## Sinopse

Noriko is a young girl who got into a car accident. When she awoke, there was a young, handsome doctor looking worriedly over her. Shinoda has a warm, childish smile that makes her feel at ease, but then he tells her some shocking news. Noriko lost her body in the accident and now is just a brain kept inside a box. Thus begins their pure love story?!
