## Sinopse

The stories within were originally published in the weekly japanese magazine "Shonen Champion Comics" beginning April, 2001 as "bonus inserts" near the pages set aside as the "readers pages". They were eventually collected into this "all Koge-Donbo" book that we hope will have everyone saying "nyo!"
