## Sinopse

The Di Gi Charat Natsuyasumi Special was another four episode series set in America that aired almost a year after the original series from August 2, 2001 to August 3, 2001. The young American otaku, Rodoyan, is introduced in this series.

• Natsuyasumi Special Episode 1 - Dejiko in America 1
• Natsuyasumi Special Episode 2 - Dejiko in America 2
When Puchiko wanted to get off a bus she couldn't reach the signal button, and the driver (looks just like Abarenbou) kept accelerating until reaching America. Soon Dejiko received a letter from Rod Young, an American boy and a big fan of Dejiko who let Puchiko stay with him, inviting Dejiko to America to visit them and pick Puchiko up.

• Natsuyasumi Special Episode 3 - Depurapyogebo Debut
A contest of bands was about to be held at Akihabara; the first prize is 10-year supply of nattou, Dejiko's favorite food. She decided to enroll but couldn't find enough members or instruments.

• Natsuyasumi Special Episode 4 - Isn`t Anyone Here-nyo?  
Dejiko and gangs of Gamers went to the mountains, but when night fell people began to disappear one by one
