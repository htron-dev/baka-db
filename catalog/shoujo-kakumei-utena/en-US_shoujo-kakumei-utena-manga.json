    "sinopse": "Utena Tenjou had a tragic childhood—her parents died when she was young, and she almost drowned, had it not been for her prince who came and rescued her. Because of the impact this prince had on her life, Utena strives to be just like him—to grow up to be a prince, not a princess, and to spread nobility, ultimately finding her prince and bringing revolution.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
