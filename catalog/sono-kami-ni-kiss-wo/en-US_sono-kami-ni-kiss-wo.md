## Sinopse

Gardener Suzaku and the Master of the house, who has a long-hair fetish, are engaged in their regular trysts, when the former purposely makes himself heard by the secretly-watching cool beauty, Suiren, the butler.
For the first time, we have a black-haired bespectacled butler character, in the titular work, "A Kiss to that Hair."

From Artist x Model, Student Council Vice-Chairperson x Tea Ceremony Club's Kimono-clad High School Student, Adult Assassin x Escaping Specialist, fellow lawyers to petit fantasy, you can have your pick of characters and situations!

A full variety of one-shots to satisfy whatever infatuations or cravings you have!
