    "sinopse": "The newest work from popular artist Shuzo Oshimi serialized in Manga Action is written in a style that brings out the unique traits of both eroticism and pure love. The main character, 29 year old Kouichi Toki, runs into his first love again after stopping inside a net cafe. Just as the two are rejoicing over their reunion, the city outside their net cafe disappears! They are stuck together with an assortment of people that have nothing in common, a band of geeks, gangsters, spoiled kids, ganguro girls, and salarymen. A dynamic love story blooming in a world cut off from reality.\n\n(Source: Jmanga)",
