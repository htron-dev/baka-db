## Sinopse

Due to their student-teacher relationship, high school student Wakino’s confession was rejected by Yukari-sensei. After graduating, Wakino promises he will confess again. However, being full bloom in puberty, every day Wakino finds their platonic relationship harder to endure. One day, Wakino mindlessly zeroes in on Yukari-sensei. Will this lead to utter rejection...?
