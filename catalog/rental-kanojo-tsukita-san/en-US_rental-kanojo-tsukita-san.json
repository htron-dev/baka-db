In order to get used to women and grow as a man, he mustered up the courage to make a reservation with a rental girlfriend! But what came was a slightly weird girl, Tsukita-san! Tsukita-san is going above and beyond what he expected, and Hoshino-kun is getting overwhelmed.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
