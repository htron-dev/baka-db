## Sinopse

26 year old Rihito Hoshino is a very shy guy who is even nervous about being handed change by a woman at a convenience store. In order to get used to women and grow as a man, he mustered up the courage to make a reservation with a rental girlfriend! But what came was a slightly weird girl, Tsukita-san! Tsukita-san is going above and beyond what he expected, and Hoshino-kun is getting overwhelmed.
