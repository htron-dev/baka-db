    "sinopse": "Matsumi Sachiko's always searching for love in the wrong places. She's made more blunders in the love department than she can count over the years, and things just never seem to go well for her. She's quick to sleep with others in her search for that special someone only to regret it later. Lately, her luck's taken an even worse turn for the worst when the guy she'd started to have feelings for asked her if she wanted to become his \"sex friend\"! Will she ever find \"the one\"?\n\n(Source: JShoujo Scans)",
