    "sinopse": "A shady bus tour of young men and women is headed to an elusive village called Nanakimura. A destination where people can partake in a utopian existence, free of the world's obstacles... or so goes the rumor.\n\nHeading deep into the mountains, the bus is carrying 30 different individuals, each harboring their own expectations and troubled hearts...\n\nWhat they had arrived to was an uninhabited village with faint, lingering scents of life as it was falling apart.\n\nJust what is the secret of Nanakimura?\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)",
