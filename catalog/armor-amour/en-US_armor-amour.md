## Sinopse

Yuji's girlfriend Misaki may seem hard and cold on the outside, but inside she's actually soft and loving. As they prepare for their high school entrance exams, Misaki decides that they should temporarily cut off all their dating activities. Will they be able to study hard enough through this period to get into the same high school?
