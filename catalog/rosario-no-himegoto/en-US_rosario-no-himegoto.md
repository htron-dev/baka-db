## Sinopse

With a mysterious look and a merciful smile, the young Father Ayase fascinates his parishioners. The only person who knows him perfectly is the daycare teacher Kaidou. Both grew up in the same institution, creating a bond of brothers, but their relationship begins to change when Kaidou hears a certain rumor: "It seems that Ayase is a prostitute."
