## Sinopse

Tatsuya Miike enjoys his life of no-strings-attached hookups and has a policy of only sleeping with straight guys who've never done it before. He flits nightly from one man to another. However, tonight's guy is... let's say, a little off. He wants way too much from Tatsuya! Why wouldn't he, though? Tatsuya's prey turns out to be a stalker with an extreme brand of love...!
