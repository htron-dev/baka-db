A School Pop Comedy!

Masaki Aoi is a high school student with a sweet tooth. All her life she has been treated like a boy but change is on the horizon for this tomboy! Yuase Takumi is a third year middle school student. He's also the president of the Confectionery Club, and he's extended an exclusive invite to Aoi to join his club....too bad he thinks she's a HE! But pressure from her classmates forces Aoi to play along and she finds herself joining the Boys-Only Confectionery Club.
