    "sinopse": "Meet Igazukin, the littlest ninja of the Iga clan! Though a student of the ninja arts, Igazukin would much rather pick flowers than pick up a throwing star, but her talent soon catches the attention of the dashing ninja, Kotaro Fuma. He comes to Igazukin with an ultimatum - join his band of ninjas or else! Can Igazukin fend off the thieves, bandits and rival ninjas that plague her training, or is she destined to wield nothing more deadly than a bouquet of flowers? (Source: ADV)",
