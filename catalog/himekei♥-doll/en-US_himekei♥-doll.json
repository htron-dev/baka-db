After a certain incident, Renji finds out just how much Ayumu loves him, and that she's determined to help him with his clothing line, [BanDit]. He agrees to let her help him, but finds out that she could also be a talented designer (although she can't sew at all) herself!\n\n(Source: Nagareboshi)",
