## Sinopse

Youichi Sawa is a college student vexed by his crush on Nanao, his tutoring student and promising ballet dancer. Sweet but arrogant, Nanao has a girlfriend, and Yoichi decides to keep his feelings a secret. But, when Nanao asks Youichi to have sex wit him, he is powerless to refuse. What started out as only a physical relationship slowly grows into a ten year story of love, heartbreak, and reunion.
