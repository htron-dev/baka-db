## Sinopse

Starting up one year after the finale of the first series, the Maruhage Empire is reformed by former emperor Tsuru Tsurulina III into the Neo-Maruhage Empire, where the Hair Hunts resume and a new generation of powerful Hair Hunt generals are created. Bo-bobo, powering the abilities of his "Fist of the Nosehair" into its "True Theory" form, rejoins Beauty and the Hajike allies to take on the renewed Maruhage threat.
