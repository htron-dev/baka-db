He resolves to change himself for the better and get a girlfriend like his older brother did...but then Akira suddenly dies in an accident. 16 years later a special policewoman and her android partner retrieve and activate a highly advanced AI and superweapon called \"Ex-Arm\" and put it into full control of their ship as a last resort. Turns out the AI is actually just Akira's brain!\n\n(Source: MU)",
