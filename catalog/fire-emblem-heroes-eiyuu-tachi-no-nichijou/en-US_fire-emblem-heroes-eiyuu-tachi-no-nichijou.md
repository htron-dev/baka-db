## Sinopse

The Kingdom of Askr has long been in conflict against the Emblian Empire. In hopes of turning the tides, Askr adds a summoner to their ranks, who has the ability to wield the Breidablik—a sacred weapon that can summon legendary heroes from other worlds.

As the Order of Heroes faction expands with the arrival of new members, life in Askr has just gotten a lot more exciting! The overwhelming presence of lively personalities and differing backgrounds sweeps away the seriousness of the battlefield and is replaced with humorous incidents. Follow Alfonse, Sharena, and the Order of Heroes as their eventful daily life continues!
