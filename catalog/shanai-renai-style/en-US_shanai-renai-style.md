## Sinopse

Tokunaga Atsuya fell in love with his new superior, Kawai Hitoshi. Kawai gave people a feeling that he’s always horny to hide his unrequited love for their colleague and dorm manager, Yuki. Tokunaga didn’t want to be a replacement and tries his best to win over Kawai. Kawai wants him to decide to be a stress-relieved partner or to be capable team player. Can Tokunaga excel in both roles? Includes Yuki’s love story with his own superior, Hoshina.

Also includes the stories "Beard and Adolescence" and "Everything's Fine as Long as There is Love".
