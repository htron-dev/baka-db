## Sinopse

Even someone like me discovered a way to find a girlfriend!

With my friends getting attached one after another, I became the last bachelor within my group. As I was sighing and lamenting such a high school life, an advertising email about a latest game app was sent to my phone. This game could actually guide the player to meet with girls by predicting the future——

Was this true? If it was, please let me meet with the daughter of the capitalist family that I looked up to, Mochizuki Rika, and the innocent model student Nakajima Konoha. In order to meet the heroines within the in-game time limit of five days, the curtain was pulled to the daily struggles with the game itself.
