    "sinopse": "Matsuoka is hooked on wearing his ex-girlfriend's clothes and going for nighttime walks into town, feeling the pleasure of being stared at by men wherever he goes. One night, after he is assaulted by a man during a one-off encounter, he is saved by Hirosue, a nondescript senior worker from his company. Drawn to Hirosue's innocent, pure love, Matsuoka continues to meet with Hirosue dressed as a woman, until Hirosue finally confesses to him. Narise Konohara's pinnacle of achievement portrays the pain and beauty of unrequited love, and has also been adapted to a theatrical play.\n\n(Source: MU)",
