## Sinopse

Stationed in the country side, Sawajiri Ai, a new recruit to the police force, didn't think she would ever see any kind of action. So it comes as a shock to her when she is transferred to headquarters into a division she has never even heard about: the 82nd division. Also known as the "Beauty Division,"—the female officers all are gorgeous woman with extraordinary talent and skills. They use their God-given body to infiltrate and crush criminal organizations and wanted men. Ai has her work cut out for her since all the members are motivated as well as extremely "persuasive."
