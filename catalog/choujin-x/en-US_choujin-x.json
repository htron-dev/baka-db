    "sinopse": "Azuma Higashi is a rather popular boy. Although he may be somewhat small, he has good fighting skills, a strong sense of justice, and his grades are at the top of his class. This is the opposite of Tokio Kurohara, his friend who does not listen in class and is simply a bystander while Azuma fights. Nonetheless, these two childhood friends' bond is strong, no matter how different they may be.\n\nThe two live in Yamato Prefecture, an incredibly ordinary district with some areas destroyed by Choujin. Choujin are humans with dangerous supernatural powers, often the cause of the surrounding destruction. Whilst on their way back home, Tokio and Azuma encounter a Choujin, who threatens to kill them. Having no chance of escape, Tokio and Azuma make a crucial decision: to become Choujin.\n\nWith these new powers acquired, Tokio can no longer be the bystander he once was, now entrapped in a world where fighting is unavoidable.\n\n[Written by Phloup]",
