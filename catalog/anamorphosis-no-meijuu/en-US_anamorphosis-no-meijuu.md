Anamorphosis revolves around a group of people invited to a contest wherein they have to stay in a supposedly haunted set for 48 hours after an evil murderous spirit is summoned to produce a recreation of the murder scene.

Over half of the book features this story and the rest is a collection of bizarre shorts designed to shock you?!
