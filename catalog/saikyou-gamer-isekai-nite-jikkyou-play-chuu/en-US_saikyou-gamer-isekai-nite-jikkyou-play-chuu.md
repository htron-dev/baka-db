## Sinopse

Kousaka Aoi is a young, avid gamer well-versed in all types of gaming. Down on his luck, he comes upon a suspicious job offer looking for those "proficient in games." Things were looking up, but before he knew it... he's thrown into another world! And now finds himself stuck at the bottom of a ravine with nothing but a pickaxe and shovel. At a loss of what to do, he slowly learns he can make a living in this by trading items he can craft.

What other possibilities are there in this new ever-expanding, game-like world our protagonist finds himself in!?
