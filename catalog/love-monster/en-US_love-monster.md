## Sinopse

"A bad boy should be punished".
The college student Akira is confessed to by Itsuki, his younger childhood friend. Akira always considered Itsuki to be his "younger brother", so he decided to answer the confession sincerely.
After the confession, Itsuki keeps acting as usual, as he did before he talked about his feelings. Akira gets confused by his unchanging attitude and everytime Itsuki gets close to him or touches him, Akira's heart beats faster.
