    "sinopse": "Karen Aijou and Hikari Kagura, along with their seven classmates of Seisho Music Academy, have successfully completed their performance of their most treasured play, \"Starlight.\" With their sights set on obtaining the lead roles for next year's rendition, the nine girls improve by the day as they train and evolve their skills on the stage.\n\nThis vigorous routine is interrupted when the academy's cultural exchange program invites students from Seiran General Arts Institute, who aim to take \"Starlight\" for themselves. Faced with new foes, the girls of Seisho Academy take to the battleground once more, contending over the exclusive right to perform the theatrical piece. In clashing, the girls are forced to confront their personal problems and relive memories of their past. Will the stage girls be able to triumph on the stage, or will they lose sight of what they hold dear?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
