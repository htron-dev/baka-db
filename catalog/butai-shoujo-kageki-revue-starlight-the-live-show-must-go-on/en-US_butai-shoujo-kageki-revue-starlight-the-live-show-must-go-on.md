## Sinopse

Hikari and Karen watched "Starlight" when they were young, and promised to stand on the same stage in the future... Karen, although a sleepyhead, continues to study the path of the Stage Girl everyday! However, due to her tardiness, the selected students were subjected to the "Legendary Training"' that would make them into "Top Stars"...? And soon... they will all be singing, dancing and taking from one another by following the mysterious audition started by Souda-sensei and... a giraffe!?
