The failure results in her being thrown away by her family.\n\nAbandoned, the only ones that extended a hand to her were the demons, the greatest enemies of the human race. Serving under them as a soldier she becomes a weapon of human slaughter, a fiend that should never have existed.\n\n(Source: Novel Updates)",
