## Sinopse

In a world where sorcery reigns supreme, bumbling witch-in-training Louise Francoise le Blanc de La Valliere is known by her classmates at the Tristain Academy of Magic as "Louise the Zero." During an important coming-of-age ritual, when each student must summon a lifelong familiar, Louise proves herself klutz when she mistakenly conjures a teenage boy from Earth. Now, whether they like it or not, Louise and her unwilling servant, Saitou, are bound to each other by the laws of magic for all eternity!
