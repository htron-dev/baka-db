    "sinopse": "Asahi Kagami—a rather outgoing guy with a tendency to try to help anyone in need—happens to be neighbors and classmates with a girl named Fuyuka Himuro. At school she's been nicknamed \"The Ice Queen\" by her classmates, and for good reason: she prefers to keep everyone at arm's length and seldom talks to others.\n\nNeither Fuyuka nor Asahi have had a chance to interact with each other yet, but Asahi's tendency to meddle in other people's business slowly but surely marks the beginning of a relationship that blooms into something more...\n\n(Source: Tentai Books)",
