## Sinopse

Due to his inability to show any emotion and his peculiar sense of rationale, Inugami could never make many friends nor could he ever find his niche. He would always sit alone, eating his lunch under a tree by himself. Even when graduating high school and joining a university, it almost seemed like he would continue his past trend. Out of the blue, he was invited to join the Theater Study Club. There, he would find his first ever comrades, but will they be able to handle his odd nature?
