    "sinopse": "Miki works as the poster girl for the shop, but frequently gets into trouble due to her boisterous, active personality. Much of the humor of the series derives from the characters' over-the-top behavior and it contains parodies of other anime styles, such as those concerning fighting and rivalry. It is a rather violent show but that is what adds to the humor.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
