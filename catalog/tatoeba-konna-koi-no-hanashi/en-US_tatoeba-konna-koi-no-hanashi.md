## Sinopse

Akira has never had a real romantic relationship, and he has told himself since high school that he must not fall in love with straight guys. One day, someone comments on his cooking blog, "Is your skill at cooking despite being a man because you're a homo?" Real love between a heterosexual man and a gay man unfolds after their rocky first communication. The true story reveals the couple's tribulations and transformations of heart.
