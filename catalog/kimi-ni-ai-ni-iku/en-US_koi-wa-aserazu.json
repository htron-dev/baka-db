    "sinopse": "Morino is the new arrival at an all-boys university prep school, who finds himself rooming with over-achieving honors student, Kusama. Apparently, Kusama keeps a secret that has him sneaking out late at night, barely returning in time for morning roll call. Morino becomes convinced it has to do with Kusama's feelings for their teacher, Kanzaki-sensei. Are the two carrying on an illicit affair under the cover of darkness? To make matters worse, Morino finds his own fascination for his new roommate growing day by day. A simple kiss leads to more, and soon, exactly what Kusama is doing when he should be sleeping turns into Morino's obsession.\n\nFeaturing characters from Meeting You, creator Mio Tennohji argues that meaningless sex can happen in a spur of the moment, but time builds a real relationship. When it comes to Kusama, Morino is more than willing to take things slow to find true love!\n\n(Source: 801 Media)",
