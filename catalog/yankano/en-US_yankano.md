## Sinopse

New student by the name of Makoto Kousaka transfers to a school full of delinquents, which is currently undergoing a battle between the various student activities' committees. His fleeting expectations of delicate and loving school girls, and a peaceful school life go out the window the moment he meets the declared queen of the school—Onizuka, while walking down a hallway. What will happen to the school life he dreams of in this romantic/comedy of two unlikely partners in school full of delinquents?
