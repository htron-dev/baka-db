## Sinopse

The members of the Amusement Club are back with more of Kyouko Toshinou's antics, Chinatsu Yoshikawa's schemes, Yui Funami's retorts, and Akari Akaza's small social presence as they strive to make each day as fun as the last! Whether the activity is an arm wrestling contest or making pancakes together, the group of entertainment-seekers are sure to give it their all.

The club members are often joined by their friends in the Student Council, who know how to have a good time as well. While it can get a little chaotic when all eight girls get together, it sure doesn't stop them from meeting up and having fun!
