## Sinopse

The story is set in the same school as Yuru Yuri.

Hiro is an ordinary first-year student who enjoys her quiet school life. One day, she picks up a drawing by Toshinou Kyoko which causes her classmate Aoi to mistake Hiro for the artist. Unable to clear up the misunderstanding, Hiro is persuaded to create a doujin game together with Aoi-chan.
