Oliver falls in love at first sight, and despite his comrades' objections, he just takes her home with him!\n\nOliver spoils Cecilia at every turn, but unfortunately, not a single one of his thoughts has reached her. Will there ever be a day where the hearts of the hero and the demon queen align...?!\n\n(Source: Shufu to Seikatsu-sha, translated)",
