    "sinopse": "Amou Takahito is just a name to everybody. The name represents a mysterious mangaka that may be a woman, or maybe not? José, on the other hand, has a face anybody would recognize. He and his bright smile are plastered across every magazine page, and everybody swoons. The two almost opposites live together and somehow manage to balance Amou's quiet and prickly personality and José's brightness and loud volume under one roof. What comes of a relationship between an anonymous artist craving zero love and a famous model with enough affection for two?\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
