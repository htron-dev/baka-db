    "sinopse": "Few people are born to rule, while most others are born to be ruled. Kakoin Seichiro is from the latter group of people, yet he's able to attend Keiho College, a prestigious school where only the wealthy can attend and the students are those who will eventually run the country. Seichiro does this by putting up a façade that gives off the impression that he belongs in this circle and using his great intellect to manipulate people through the use of human psychology. He despises those around him for being born into a gifted situation unlike himself and will use anybody as a stepping stone to make his way up the social ladder.\n\nOne day, Seichiro is introduced to Shinmei Tamami, a teenage girl from an incredibly wealthy and powerful family, through being her tutor and discovers that, somehow, she possesses the power to materialize objects. Realizing that this will be his ticket to his dream, he tries to understand and manipulate Tamami’s incredible power.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
