## Sinopse

While attending a friends wedding,Yuzu meets a drunk pervert who just so happens to be the same popular delinquent who helped her out in her school days. Having not known his name or anything much about him at the time, she had held a certain image of him in her mind. But as the years have gone by and changed, so have they both, and she can't help feeling disappointed at finally meeting him again.

The delinquent, Naomi Senzaki, on the other hand, has feelings far from disappointment, as the two of them keep "accidentally" meeting and he remembers little details about her previous years, and how she slapped him back then.

But what's this? Yuzu already has a boyfriend? How will things develop for Naomi and Yuzu?
