## Sinopse

Because of her fathers job, Aki was raised in England. So when she moved back to Japan she was teased horribly for being "foreign". Now Aki is also a very beatiful young woman, which makes it even harder to make friends and be accepted. After the coolest boy at school starts taking an interest in her, things only get worse. As the jealous girls start to harass her, Aki shows a side of herself that even she didn't know about.
