## Sinopse

Nagisa Takakage just opened a restaurant, and finds himself with a strange regular customer. All the chefs agree that Kouga Nagisa is a real looker, and nobody minds that he shows up to ask them questions at work. After Kouga gets himself drunk at the restaurant though, Nagisa is forced to take him home, and finds things heating up a bit.
