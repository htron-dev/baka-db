## Sinopse

Suginoha Tsukushi has worked too hard her entire life to be denied job after job after graduating college. But reality is brutal and the last hope for an occupation was at Yumeneko Projects. She learns that she is competing for the position with Himezaki Fubuki, an art student who has won several awards for her design work. Both girls are shocked when the interview somehow gets them to participate in a "Cat Fight" where amateur girls fight each other in skimpy clothing for male entertainment. Tsukushi, being an uptight rule follower, has major hesitations but with her rival Fubuki so willing, what choice does she have?
