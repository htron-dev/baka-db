Kay now fights against freakish fiends in a world of \"Images,\" a horrible place formed by each character's imagination. In this world of \"Images,\" values are confused: enemies become friends, good becomes evil, and vice-versa. Kay must continue her battle in a place called \"5 Minutes into the Future.\"\n\nBased off of the Maken X video game for the Dreamcast.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
