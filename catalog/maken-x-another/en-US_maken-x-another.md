## Sinopse

Due to an accident at her father's scientific research institute, Kay, an ordinary teenager, is forced to become the owner of "Machina," a strange shaped sword with the power to capture human souls. Kay now fights against freakish fiends in a world of "Images," a horrible place formed by each character's imagination. In this world of "Images," values are confused: enemies become friends, good becomes evil, and vice-versa. Kay must continue her battle in a place called "5 Minutes into the Future."

Based off of the Maken X video game for the Dreamcast.
