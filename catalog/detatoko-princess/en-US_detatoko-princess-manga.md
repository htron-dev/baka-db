## Sinopse

Lapis is the princess of Sorcerland. She's beautiful, powerful and has a sparkling personality; it's too bad that she's not that bright. She'll go to any length to protect the most innocent of creatures even if it means destroying the kingdom to do so. And lets not forget her obsession with pudding!
