## Sinopse

A young man was assulted by a gangster and got heavily injured. While staying in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital and being semi-unconcious, he saw the image of a beautiful girl saying his heart is "compatible" with hers. After he recovered from his injuries, he bumped into that girl again -- only then he has learned that girl has innate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and his human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is completely compatible with hers, which is not only a miracle but also means she needs his heart -- literally.
