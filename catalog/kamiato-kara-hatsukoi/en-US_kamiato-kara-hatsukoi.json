    "sinopse": "Thanks to a devastating incident in middle school, Rika has to spend the rest of his life hiding the mark of an alpha whose name he doesn't even know. Just when he thinks he can survive hiding his truth through college, another incident leads to him reuniting with his so-called fated alpha—but is a bite in the heat of the moment really enough to map out the rest of their lives?\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
