## Sinopse

All begins when Soga Naoaki went to complain to the president of the student counsil, Yoshizumi Sekai, about the reducing of his volleyball team's bookings. By coincidence, Naoaki becomes the vice-president of the student counsil because of the health of the current one. He and Sekai don't get along, but what happens when they have to organise the school festival?
