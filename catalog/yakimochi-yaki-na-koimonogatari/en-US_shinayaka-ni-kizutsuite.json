    "sinopse": "Ai was just a normal girl minding her own business when she met this guy. The guy was so poor and down on his luck that he couldn't even pay for his own meal. Ai took pity on the guy and decided to treat him out for lunch. What should have been a fairly innocent meeting with the guy turns rather weird when she decides to take him home and give him a place to sleep. That should have been all since the guy left very early in the morning and nothing untoward happened...but...is it possible? After how long, has she met the guy again?\n\nSummary from Selene Scans.",
