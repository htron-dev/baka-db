## Sinopse

Three 10-minute videos present a trippy view into the minds of their creators. Brought together by Pierre Taki of Denki Groove, Mechano: Scientific Attack Force features three shorts done in very different styles.

The three short films are:

"Plastic Gun Man" - a 3D Western spoof
"World Meccano Triangle" - a music video reminiscent of '90s era screensavers
"Haiirogaoka no Soridaijin" (translated as "Prime Minister of Gray Hill") - an anime-style animated video parody of Akira Mochizuki's famous 1977 manga, Yuuhi ga Oka no Souri Daijin
