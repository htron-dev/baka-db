## Sinopse

Yosemine Takumi is a difficult student to handle. He's used to get what he wants by using his family's strength in school. The new Infirmary Nurse, Tsutsui, is determined to change all that. He's not going to let himself be bullied by Yosemine, or anyone else, after all these years. But Yosemine has fallen head-over-heels in love with Tsutsui-sensei and set the goal on owning the nurse for himself!
