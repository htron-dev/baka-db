His world is shaken up when a brilliant, new conductor, Tounoin Kei, is recruited to breathe life into their music and orchestra. Yuuki feels Tounoin's high demands will do nothing but chase away the members, but when he draws more from them than they ever thought possible, Yuuki reconsiders his own motives for staying at Fujimi.

Nursing a wounded pride Yuuki wants to resign from Fujimi, but Tounoin has other ideas...\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nCh. 1-3) Cold Front Conductor [ 寒冷前線コンダクター], Vols. 1-3\nCh. 4-5) Do You Like the Concert?, Vols. 1-2\n\nBased on the novel series by Kou Akizuki and illustrated by Sei Gotoh, in honor of the 10-year anniversary of the original novel.",
