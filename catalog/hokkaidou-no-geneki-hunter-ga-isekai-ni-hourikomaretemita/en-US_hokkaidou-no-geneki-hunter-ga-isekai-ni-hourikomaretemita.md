## Sinopse

Shin Nakajiima, a hunter in Hokkaido, dies trying to protect a kid from a violent brown bear. However, when he wakes up, he's in a different world. From the radio, the voice of a woman who claims to be a goddess... Apparently, the cheat ability is only a mysterious bag from which you can buy hunting guns and bullets if you put in money.

Are hunting guns and modern hunting knowledge useful in a different world with swords and magic, demons and heroes? A different world hunting life begins with a reliable elf wife!
