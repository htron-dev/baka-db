From the radio, the voice of a woman who claims to be a goddess... Apparently, the cheat ability is only a mysterious bag from which you can buy hunting guns and bullets if you put in money.\n\nAre hunting guns and modern hunting knowledge useful in a different world with swords and magic, demons and heroes? A different world hunting life begins with a reliable elf wife!\n\n(Source: Mag Garden, translated)",
