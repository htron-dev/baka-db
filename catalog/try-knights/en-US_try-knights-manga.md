## Sinopse

One day, the new rugby club member Akira gets advice on running from Riku, who used to be absorbed in rugby but gave it up because he lacked the physique for the sport. Akira takes an interest in Riku, and Riku's passion for the rugby gradually returns. By joining forces, the pair can play a new tactical game and aim for the top of high school rugby.
