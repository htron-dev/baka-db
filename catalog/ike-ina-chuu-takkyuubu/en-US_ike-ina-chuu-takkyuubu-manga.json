    "sinopse": "There are six members of the boy's ping pong club. Two are relatively normal; however, the other four consist of an aspiring sexual deviant, two perverts, and a guy with lethal B.O. Add in a cantakerous girl as a manager, and you have the entire crew.\n\nThis series pushes the boundaries of good taste beyond anything the western world has experienced, yet somehow manages to remain vaguely charming. The antics of the ping pong club includes one member's trademark \"Protruding Pecker Serve,\" molesting cross-dressing members, and the infamous \"Turtle Sequence,\" which is much too horrifying to describe.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 9: 800\nVolume 11: Panda ga Deta zo",
