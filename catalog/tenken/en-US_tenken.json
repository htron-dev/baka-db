But she has been chosen for an unthinkable role; a princess must be sacrificed to the monster Yamata-no-Orochi at the 50 year Tenken Festival. Can Manaka, the man who is in love with her, follow her into this abyss to save her from fate; only to discover the dark secret of the ceremony?\n\n(Source: One Peace Books)",
