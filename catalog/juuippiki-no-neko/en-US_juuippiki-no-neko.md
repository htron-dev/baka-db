## Sinopse

A gang of eleven stray cats wreak havoc in a small town, costing them much trouble.
They defend themselves by stating they were just 'hungry'.

The cats hear of an urban legend about a scary, giant fish. They decide to take on the challenge to find and catch that fish, proving the citizens of the town that they're not all useless after all.

The task is pretty tricky and the path they have to cross is stony and danger lurks everywhere.

Will our little furry heroes be brave, confident and strong enough to master the challenge of challenges?
