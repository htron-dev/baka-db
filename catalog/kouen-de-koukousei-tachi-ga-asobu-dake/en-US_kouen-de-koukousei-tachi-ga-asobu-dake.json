    "sinopse": "I, Chisato Azuma, and Erika Segawa, are childhood friends who go way back. In elementary school, middle school, and even in high school, Segawa and I have played at the park. Chatting, playing baseball, running around, and sometimes fighting a little.\n\n\"For now, Azuma, you can place me at the top of your cuteness pyramid. Then you can understand cuteness through me.\"\n\"What exactly does it mean to place you at the top of the cuteness pyramid, Segawa?\"\n\"The more someone looks like me, the more you see them as cute, Azuma.\"\n\"Well then, I guess this calculator looks cute.\"\n\"Hold it. Am I a calculator to you, Azuma?\"\n\nAnd thus, the easygoing daily lives of high school students are woven together in the park today again...\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
