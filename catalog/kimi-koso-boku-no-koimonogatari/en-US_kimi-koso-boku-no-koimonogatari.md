## Sinopse

Momoka is a newbie editor at a publishing house who cannot get out of the economical slump. As a last resort for saving the company, she decides to request a manuscript from Kirishima, who was once a very successful romance novelist. Momoka used to be his great fan, so she is overflowing with enthusiasm, but Kirishima rejects the proposal on the spot with the words “I have absolutely no intention of writing another novel.” However, Momoka will not give up..!
