    "sinopse": "Everyone thinks 16-year-old Ryouko has weird taste in guys because she can't stop drooling over Ryuu, the strong silent type who sits next to her in class. When she discovers he works for a host club—where women actually pay men to date them—will she finally wise up? Or will he leave his job to be with her? Or will she take a job at the club so he can quit so she can be with him so...? Only one thing's for sure in B.O.D.Y.—you can't put a price on love!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Saa Kyou mo Gakkou da",
