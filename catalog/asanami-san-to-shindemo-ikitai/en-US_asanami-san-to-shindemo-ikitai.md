## Sinopse

A girl who talks about something very passionately is cute... But what if she is talking about the ways to kill people!? This is the story of Itsuki-kun, the class president, spending time doing odd jobs together with the beautiful girl, Asanami-san. They spend time together in the cute afterschool hours... but occasionally, a change occurs. When the topic comes to "death"... she becomes extremely heated! Laying herself bare and lots of skinship! She transforms! This is a slightly perverted love comedy where you can learn the ways to kill people with a pure and beautiful girl.
