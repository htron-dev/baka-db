## Sinopse

Mizuki Haruno, who has been spending her days feeling blue, was taken to a live concert by her childhood friend, Nozomi. She caught a glimpse of the "exciting world there."

"Nozomi...I want to play in a girls' band!"

The story of Mizuki who became a high-school student begins now! This is a rockin' youth story woven by the four individual girls from the music band at Hakumai High School in a town in Hokkaido!
