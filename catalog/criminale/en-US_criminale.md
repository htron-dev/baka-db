## Sinopse

Since the day he was born, Tamito Ichimura's life was filled with misfortune. Every day, he becomes a victim of various crimes, no matter how ridiculous they are. As a result, he carries out his life fully prepared for what may happen next.

On Tamito's first day at his new school, a criminal attacks him, which is nothing different from the usual. However, seeing that a girl is passing by, Tamito tries to save her. Moreover, upon entering school, he notices odd things about his classmates. He soon comes to know that each one of them is either a criminal or a suspect—including the girl he saved earlier. Tamito attempts to run away but is gradually convinced to continue attending.

Even while constantly attracting criminals, his abnormal life will continue in this ludicrous school, as he will face many more criminal encounters, while befriending the most unexpected—his very own unlawful classmates.
