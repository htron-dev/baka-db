    "sinopse": "2nd grade junior high school kid, Shirai Sachi (14), gets tutored by the beautiful and easy-going woman, Chabatake Nana (21). Although she slacks off when tutoring, actually not helping his studies at all, for Sachi it's all fine and dandy. Being alone together with a hot, older woman in his own bedroom, frolicking around, unintentionally revealing neathage, or just lying down on his bed, with her bare long legs or the cleavage of her ample breasts in perfect view. Who could complain? It's an adolescent boy's fantasy fulfilled!\n\n(Source: MU)",
