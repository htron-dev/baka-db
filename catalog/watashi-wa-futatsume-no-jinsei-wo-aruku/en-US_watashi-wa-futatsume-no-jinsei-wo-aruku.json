    "sinopse": "Life couldn't get much worse for the Daeman Princess Fie. Since birth, she has always been considered lesser and undesired when compared to her kind and radiant younger twin sister, Fielle. Now, Fie has reached the most unfortunate end: forced into becoming the second wife of Orstoll King Roy, a mere dowry gift for Fielle's marriage to the king.\n\nAlthough thrown aside to live in an abandoned villa, with neither companions nor servants, Fie finds a way to reclaim her future—disguise herself as a boy and become a royal knight of the Orstoll Kingdom. Casting away her despair, she begins her second path through life, where Fie is sure to learn of dedication, camaraderie, and friendship, all while discovering her place in the world.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
