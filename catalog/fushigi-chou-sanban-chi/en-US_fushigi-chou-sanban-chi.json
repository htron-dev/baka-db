    "sinopse": "3, Street of Mysteries explores the fantastical-poetic vein that has forged Mizuki's reputation in Japan. The stories contained in this series hold in common the obsessive ideas of immortality and of life after death. Skillfully blending a range of black humor, drama, and questions of morality, Mizuki shows once more his profound understanding of the human soul.\n\n(Source: paraphrased from Astiberri)",
