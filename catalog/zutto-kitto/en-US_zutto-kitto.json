    "sinopse": "College student Yuzuki Hamura is a track-and-field athlete who has competed at the National Championship level during middle and senior high school. However, he focuses strictly on pole-vaulting, to the detriment of his team. This is due to a casual comment by Jin Akishima, a fellow athlete with whom he parted ways after graduation, about the sky being the means through which they are connected. He cannot forget Jin or detach from their past, and this causes problems with his girlfriend, one of which leads to a coincidental reunion with his obsession.\n\n(Source: MU)",
