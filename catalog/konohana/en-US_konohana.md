## Sinopse

The series was cancelled due to conflicts between the author and the editors of Champion Red Ichigo, but was continued with a different main cast as Kono Yo wo Hana ni Suru Tame ni in a different magazine.

Mankind faces its toughest threat at the hands of mysterious alien invaders while revolutionaries go wild across the Earth and the planet's only hope of survival is a giant perverted robot and the two lesbian girls that pilot it.
