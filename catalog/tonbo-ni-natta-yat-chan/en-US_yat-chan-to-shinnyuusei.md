## Sinopse

Yat-chan is still hanging around as a ghost but has now gained supernatural powers to teach people traffic rules through a laser beam out of his finger, though people still cannot see nor hear him. In an odd parallel Yat-chan follows a boy named Ken-chan who looks a lot like him, who acts a lot like him (irresponsibly near traffic) when he was alive, and who also has a childhood friend and classmate named Miko (unrelated to Yat-chan's Miko from the first OVA).

Ken-chan nearly perishes the same way Yat-chan thanks to Yat-chan using his beam to save his life. Ken-chan encounters a few other people who are ignoring traffic safety and with Yat-chan following, they help some people out. Such as an elderly woman who tries to cross a road because to tired to climb up the stairs of a pedestrian overpass.
