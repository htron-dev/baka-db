## Sinopse

Shoko Hidaka’s breakthrough comic is a collection of eye-opening love stories. Yousuke suddenly shows up on the door step of his old high school buddy Tanigawa after years of no contact. While the two had a budding relationship back in school, things fell apart and they decided to part ways and search for their true love. However, it might be that their relationship in the golden days of high school was what they have been looking for all along.
