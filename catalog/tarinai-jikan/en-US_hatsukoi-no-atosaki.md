## Sinopse

Nishima is doing well at his prestigious company but after divorcing from a loveless marriage his success at work seems empty. A chance meeting at a cafe brings him into contact with the owner, Miyama, an old high school classmate. It seems that Miyama has forgotten him until he asks Nishima why he's no longer wearing a wedding ring and what Nishina said to him 10 years ago in high school.
