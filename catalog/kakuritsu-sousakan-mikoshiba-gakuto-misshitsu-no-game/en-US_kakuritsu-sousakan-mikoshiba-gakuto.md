## Sinopse

Niizuma Tomoki has been re-assigned to the Special Investigations Counter-Measures Unit after her one month suspension. This basement unit only has two others assigned?! The future of police is entrusted in the hands of the pretty-faced young mathematician called Mikoshiba Gakuto. Objectively weighing the truth of cases from a mathematical approach. Clearly and splendidly exposing the depths of the human heart with numbers!
