He happened upon a cafe where once stood a great wrestling arena lead by the \"Amazoness kitty.\" Now three daughters remain running it. Yukihyou (Who has taken a sudden interest in him.) Ferris (A rather ditzy young woman.) And Leona (A Tsundere-ish big boobed girl with a rather \"Unique\" Ability in the wrestling ring.) Join Daikichi \"sandbag\" Kamiyama as he endures the trails ahead of him with these Bombshells.\n\n(Source: Imangascans)",
