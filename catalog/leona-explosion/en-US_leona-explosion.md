## Sinopse

This is Dakichi Kamiyama. A College Student at Toudai University. He had came back to his home town to attend such a prestigious University. He happened upon a cafe where once stood a great wrestling arena lead by the "Amazoness kitty." Now three daughters remain running it. Yukihyou (Who has taken a sudden interest in him.) Ferris (A rather ditzy young woman.) And Leona (A Tsundere-ish big boobed girl with a rather "Unique" Ability in the wrestling ring.) Join Daikichi "sandbag" Kamiyama as he endures the trails ahead of him with these Bombshells.
