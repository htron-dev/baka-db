## Sinopse

"People often die around me." A series of bizarre "deaths" stalks Genji. While a string of haunting memories and mystery surround him, all rooted in his childhood. A dear friend, a murder, and a curse. As more and more "deaths" unravel, the horrifying truth behind the origin grows ever more entangled. Seemingly the only keys to solve these mysteries, are the charismatic shinigami Touya, and Genji's own memories. Kindaichi Case Files writer Seimaru Amagi and Zetsuai creator Minami Ozaki come together to bring you a gripping mystery surrounding the past, memories, and a chain of deaths.
