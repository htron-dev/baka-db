    "sinopse": "Menou Aoi pledged to be a great stewardess (or cabin attendant?) after Hanzo—her childhood love interest—said an ugly-looking girl cannot be a stewardess. She realized that pledge, but instead of being praised as great, she is often labeled as clumsy. She serves the Tokyo - New York leg with other 10 male cabin attendants who are good looking from head to toe. One of them, James, suspiciously has a face like Hanzo. (Source: M-U)",
