She solves cases by taking up different personas, and this time her mission is to serve as a body double for the vice president. Omega's director, Adam, will be going on the mission with Maggie, posing as her lover. His role will allow him to stay close to her. He promises to always be by Maggie's side, which is going to be tough for her because she's had hidden feelings for the calm and elegant Adam for a very long time.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
