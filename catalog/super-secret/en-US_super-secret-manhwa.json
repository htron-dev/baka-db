    "sinopse": "Emma Ji and Ryan Nam have been neighbors and, more importantly, friends for as long as they can remember. Emma is an airhead who would be lost without her friend and his eccentric family, who have agreed to take care of her in her parents' absence. From waking her up every morning to cleaning her room, Ryan is always at her beck and call, much like an overbearing mother. The Nam family also has a supernatural secret that they can't let anyone learn, but they find that it is increasingly difficult to hide it with Emma constantly around. When she comes home from school one day, Emma discovers a giant dog sleeping on her balcony! Will Emma ever discover who the dog belongs to and why Ryan is never around when the dog is?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
