## Sinopse

Sano, the handsome and popular guy who sits next to me in class, has made it his hobby to tease me. He always acts like a prince in front of his other friends, so why am I the only one he treats this way? Somehow, though, despite his nosiness, he still always pays attention to me. It's the kind of nosiness that could make a girl's heart skip a beat!
