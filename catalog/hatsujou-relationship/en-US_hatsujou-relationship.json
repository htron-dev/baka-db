What saves him from this mess is a cool, strong and handsome Yankee, Tani Reiji. So he asks if he can be his underling, only to be rejected without a second thought. However, he can't give up his desire to get closer, and when he stubbornly follows him, Reiji gives in and offers him an unexpected proposal: \"I could be your friend\"...! As a result of getting closer and closer to the beautiful and sexy Reiji, Hajime's horny and naughty fantasies go out of control!\n\n(Source: Julian Publishing, translated)",
