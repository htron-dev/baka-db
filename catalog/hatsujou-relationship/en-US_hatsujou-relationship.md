## Sinopse

Second year high schooler, Hajime Nakamura, on his first day at his new school runs into a gang of delinquents and gets into serious trouble! What saves him from this mess is a cool, strong and handsome Yankee, Tani Reiji. So he asks if he can be his underling, only to be rejected without a second thought. However, he can't give up his desire to get closer, and when he stubbornly follows him, Reiji gives in and offers him an unexpected proposal: "I could be your friend"...! As a result of getting closer and closer to the beautiful and sexy Reiji, Hajime's horny and naughty fantasies go out of control!
