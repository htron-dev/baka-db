## Sinopse

Perpetually bored, Natsuo Ishidou has been physically adept for as long as she can remember. Her ability to almost instantly pick up any kind of sport has left her constantly searching for any kind of challenge. However, because she rarely finds anything difficult, she has developed a narcissistic and apathetic attitude toward everyone around her.

One day, Natsuo sees a fellow student trying to advertise a mixed martial arts club. When the girl, named Yuzuko Mawatari, targets Natsuo from the crowd and extends an invitation to her, she becomes irritated with her demeanor and accepts the request in an attempt to discover why Yuzuko seems to be so carefree.

But while Natsuo participates in the mixed martial arts club, people from her past still have a bone to pick with her. Can she deal with the consequences of her poor attitude while rising to the challenge of someone who may actually be stronger than her?
