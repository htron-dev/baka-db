## Sinopse

Ichigo is a fourteen year old half Japanese girl that grew up in Lapland. After the death of her father, she moves to Japan where she is hosted by Ikuta Rintaro and his family. His father is a writer and his older brother Moritarou is an university student. Ichigo’s secret dream is to marry Rintaro someday.
Since Ichigo can’t read kanji, she is obliged to attend primary school. On top of that, her whole lack of familiarity with the culture and customs of the Japanese generates a lot of misunderstanding and confusion. But the people around her start to love her as she is a very kind girl, despite her poor health. Rintaro also begins to experience affection for Ichigo, but her health gradually becomes worse…
