## Sinopse

Higuchi Kotarou was just a normal sixth-grader until he gets a new next-door neighbor - an insanely perky angel named Misha that has made it her life's work to make Kotarou happy! And if that weren't enough, Misha has an even stranger roommate - a kind-hearted demon named Shia and her mysterious black cat Nyaa! If Kotarou's life at home is this weird.. what can it possibly be like at school?! (Source: Seven Seas)
