    "sinopse": "Jump into the life of twenty-something Naru as he navigates through the confusing world of modern dating. He’s faced with familiar moments we've all been through such as \"should I add that smiley face at the end of the text?\" or \"why haven't they responded to my text?\" But the added challenge for Naru? He's never dated, doesn't use a cellphone and most importantly someone's out there to sabotage his dating life!\n\n(Source: Spottoon)",
