## Sinopse

Jump into the life of twenty-something Naru as he navigates through the confusing world of modern dating. He’s faced with familiar moments we've all been through such as "should I add that smiley face at the end of the text?" or "why haven't they responded to my text?" But the added challenge for Naru? He's never dated, doesn't use a cellphone and most importantly someone's out there to sabotage his dating life!
