    "sinopse": "Kousuke suddenly wakes up alone in a vast forest that clearly isn’t anywhere on Earth. Now he has to find some way to eat, drink, and survive! Luckily, Kousuke also has the power to craft using a special video game menu that allows him to harvest resources and build whatever he can imagine. However, every time he goes to sleep, he’s attacked by one of the many non-human races of this world, all of whom despise humankind. Enter Sylphy, the beautiful dark elf who lays claim to Kousuke and vows to protect him–after all, she’s taken him as her property!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
