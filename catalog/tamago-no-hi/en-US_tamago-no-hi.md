## Sinopse

Naono Bohra's only published non-yaoi series (aside from doujinshi's). Contains elements of fantasy, horror, comedy, romance, action, adventure and drama. Centers around 4 supernatural male characters and 1 female who joins them.

After the erosion of the atmosphere (dimensional barrier), the world itself is about to cease (disappear). What's left of mankind has used up every bit of technology that remained. To defend the world they built artificial bodies.
