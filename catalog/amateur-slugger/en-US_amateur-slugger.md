## Sinopse

Ishizaka Kousuke and his amateur team are playing a match and winning handily, when suddenly a mysterious girl comes to the mound as Kousuke comes to bat and strikes him out easily. It's revenge for his getting a home run off of a friend of hers at Koshien 3 years prior, and she's not going to let him off with just one match.
