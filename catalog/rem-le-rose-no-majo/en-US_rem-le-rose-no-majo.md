## Sinopse

Roshelle, a kind-hearted young man living in a village, was soon to enter a knight school for nobles. However on the day of the banquet which was celebrating his passing the entrance exam, he went outside with his brother, and walked into the forbidden shrine where he was cursed by a witch. In order to relinquish the curse, that is said to bring him his death within 7 days, Roshelle went alone into the castle in the misty forest where the witch was said to reside...

Sleeping in the castle was Andalucia Rem le rose, a beautiful girl who was possessed by the witch as well.

A tale pursuing reality and memories from a hundred years ago is raising its curtain...
