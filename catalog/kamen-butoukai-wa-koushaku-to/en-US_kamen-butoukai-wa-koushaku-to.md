## Sinopse

In 1812, more than one hundred years before the Russian revolution, there was a youthful Russian Army captain, beautiful and proud. Blue-eyed Alex, a favorite of the tsar, is accompanying him to England. But Alex is a woman—born into the nobility, she ran away from home when forced to marry. Since then she has pretended to be a man. But when she meets the bright Duke Calder in England, she falls in love. Is it time for Alex to reveal her true self?
