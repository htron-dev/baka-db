## Sinopse

It's been about 6 months since the end of Yatteranneeze! and Chisato and Kanae have FINALLY gotten their shit together... or have they? They still fight all the time, clash at work and glare at each other across the breakfast table. But a little adversity has a funny way of bringing people together...
