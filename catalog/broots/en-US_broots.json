    "sinopse": "The original six-minute \"pilot\" featured a slightly different version of Might Orbots called Broots (pronounced \"Brutes\"). Rob and Ono looked similar to their 'finished' selves, though definitively more late 70s-like. The Orbots, while having the same names as in the finished product, are subtly different, and obviously unfinished. Even their combined form aka \"Super-Broots\" would go through some more developmental evolution before becoming Mighty Orbots.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
