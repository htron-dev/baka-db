When he arrives at his villa with a beautiful woman in tow, a quiet widow appears in front of him. Widowed Liz, who's in charge of managing the villa's garden, isn't Cam's type, but he can't get her out of his mind. When she cries at the memory of her late husband, it shocks him. Is there even one woman who would cry for Cam? He realizes he wants a loyal partner. He'll even give up his playboy ways to win one!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
