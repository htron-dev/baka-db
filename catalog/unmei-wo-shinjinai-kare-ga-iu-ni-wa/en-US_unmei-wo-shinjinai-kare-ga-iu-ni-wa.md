## Sinopse

Love as destined is boring.

Kousuke, who can see the red thread of fate, suffers from unrequited love at the university. However, he hid that feeling in his heart, because he knew that the two "red threads of fate" weren't connected... On the other hand, one day, Yuka is told by a fortune-teller that "the fateful partner is nearby" and becomes aware of Kousuke as a romantic partner.

Unmei wo Shinjinai Kare ga Iu ni wa depicts the love of an adult who is at the mercy of fate.
