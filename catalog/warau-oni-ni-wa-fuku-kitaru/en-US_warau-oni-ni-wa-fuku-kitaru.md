Sanpaku-eyed Emu Ikariya is a young man who has known poverty and hardship since childhood. After the sudden death of his alcoholic father, he is approached by a loan shark who informs him that he has inherited his father's debt. Just as he is being coerced into dubious work to pay it off, a face from his past appears with a shocking proposition.
