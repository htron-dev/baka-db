To fulfill his dream, he has been tasked to defeat his teacher and caretaker, Yukihime, who will then permit him to go to the capital.\n\nTouta's life turns upside down when a bounty hunter arrives to claim a prize on Yukihime's head. In a desperate attempt to save both his mentor and friends, Touta follows Yukihime's instruction to drink her blood, turning him into an immortal monster capable of defeating the bounty hunter.\n\nYukihime reveals herself to be Evangeline Athanasia Katherine McDowell, a centuries-old vampire. With her identity now exposed, she and Touta flee to the capital and embark on an exciting adventure that will change both of their lives forever.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
