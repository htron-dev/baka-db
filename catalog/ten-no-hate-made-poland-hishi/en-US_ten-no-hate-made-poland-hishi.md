## Sinopse

In the 18th century, The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was an elective monarchy, in which the king was elected by the nobility. The kingdom thrived under its unprecedented in the history of Europe, yet flawed democratic political system. Many difficult trials stand in front of this freedom-loving country.
