## Sinopse

A young man has left Tokyo for Istanbul to meet his mother and find his long-lost father. But instead, he finds that he's fallen headlong into somebody else's rebellion!

Jiro Manabe hasn't seen his parents since he was a child. He doesn't know what to expect, except that his mother is Turkish and his Japanese father mysteriously disappeared when he was almost too young to remember. When a stranger appears who can take Jiro to his mother, the mysteries that Jiro has come to solve only grow deeper. Is a drug-addled belly dancer Jiro's mother? Why and where did Jiro's father go? And perhaps most importantly, why are army troops trying to gun them down?
