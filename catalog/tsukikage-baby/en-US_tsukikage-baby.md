## Sinopse

In a small provincial town filled with a spirit of preservation for a traditional performance art called, "Owara," arrives Hotaruko, a transfer student from Tokyo. When a local boy named Hikaru catches her in an awkward stance in—what was supposed to be—an empty classroom, they form a strange bond. What's more, their bond makes way for an unexpected development...?!
