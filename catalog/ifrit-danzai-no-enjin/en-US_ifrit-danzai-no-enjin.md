## Sinopse

On the surface Yu and Minami are very typical; they work at a coffeehouse and live mundane lives. What most people do not know is that Yu and Ninami are both assassins who have had their bodies modified against their will. As they carry out their contracted kills, they search for the people responsible for their transformation.
