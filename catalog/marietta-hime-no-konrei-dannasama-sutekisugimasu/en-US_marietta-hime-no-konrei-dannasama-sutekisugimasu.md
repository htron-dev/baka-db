## Sinopse

The innocent Princess Marietta of Stellaus was forced into marriage with the hulking General Belvant of Oltaire—this is the narrative that everyone believes. They are not without reason; with the strength to subdue all his enemies, the imposing Belvant is a frightful figure. However, for Marietta, this couldn't be further from the truth.

In fact, Marietta is infatuated with the grizzled Belvant, and swoons at the idea of their marriage. But for some reason, people keep misinterpreting the couple. To others, Marietta's lovesickness seems like fear, and though Belvant is truly kind, he appears uncaring and brutish. For the fae-like princess and misunderstood general, what will they face on their road to a romantic, love-filled marriage?
