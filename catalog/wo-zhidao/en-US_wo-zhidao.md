## Sinopse

The little rabbit was playing hiding and seek with its mother, but the mother worried that the little rabbit would meet a wolf. The mother sang a song that described what a wolf looks like, and mimicked a wolf. The little replied, "I know, I know," despite having never seen a wolf before. The story follows the little rabbit encountering other animals and judging them to be a wolf or not by comparing them to the description from the song.
