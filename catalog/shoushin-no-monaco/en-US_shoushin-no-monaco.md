## Sinopse

She was his pregnant mistress...

Two years ago, Freya Addison fell for sexy billionaire Zac Deverell. He gave her everything money could buy, and more pleasure in the bedroom than she'd thought possible. But when Freya announced she was pregnant, Zac threw her out.

Now she'll become his wife!

When they meet again, the passion between them is as strong as ever. Zac whisks Freya away to Monaco and back to his bed, where he'll get his answers! If the baby is his, he'll make Freya his wife....
