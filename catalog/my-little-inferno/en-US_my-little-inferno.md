## Sinopse

I don't know what kind of person "Maa-kun" is. He's huge and super-scary, is staying at my place after telling me to shelter him, and he stole ￥ 1,120,000 (It was ￥ 3,000,000, but he returned some of it). The first time I met him...he attacked me and made me cry, and I thought he was going to kill me. I wanted to die. But "Maa-kun" also cooks me broiled salmon for breakfast, listens to me when I talk, and he runs off the guys I hate... "Maa-kun" is such an unknown; why is his accomplice (and ex-boyfriend) from his hacker days following him?
