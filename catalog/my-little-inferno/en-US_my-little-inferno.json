    "sinopse": "I don't know what kind of person \"Maa-kun\" is. He's huge and super-scary, is staying at my place after telling me to shelter him, and he stole ￥ 1,120,000 (It was ￥ 3,000,000, but he returned some of it). The first time I met him...he attacked me and made me cry, and I thought he was going to kill me. I wanted to die. But \"Maa-kun\" also cooks me broiled salmon for breakfast, listens to me when I talk, and he runs off the guys I hate... \"Maa-kun\" is such an unknown; why is his accomplice (and ex-boyfriend) from his hacker days following him?\n\n(Source: Shodensha, translated)",
