    "sinopse": "Aristide enrolled into an elite music school following his grandfather's dying wish for him to study music and become a great musician like his father. Aristide isn't your typical student. He comes from the countryside and learned to play the violin from his grandfather and neighbor, a stark contrast to the formal, extensive training of his peers. He was enrolled as a special case, being the 101st student admitted into a class of only 100. This and his unrefined technique attract derision from some students and teachers. Aristide obviously has raw talent, but struggles with formal technique and written scores. However, he is determined to improve and remain at the school, chasing after the memory of his father's sound.\n\n(Source: shinkeikaku)",
