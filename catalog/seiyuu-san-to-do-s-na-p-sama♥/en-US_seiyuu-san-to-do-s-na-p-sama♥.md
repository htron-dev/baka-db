## Sinopse

Misuzu is a rookie voice actress, and for the first time since her debut, she's been chosen as the main female lead of a romance anime. However, what awaited her in the recording studio was a devil disguised in a suit: the sadistic producer Souta Naruse! For him, Misuzu's just not up to his standards, and in order for her to portray the character well, she receives extreme training from Naruse! Is this simply a professional relationship? Or is there something more?
