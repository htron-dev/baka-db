However, what awaited her in the recording studio was a devil disguised in a suit: the sadistic producer Souta Naruse! For him, Misuzu's just not up to his standards, and in order for her to portray the character well, she receives extreme training from Naruse! Is this simply a professional relationship? Or is there something more?\n\n(Source: M&C!, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shots: Koakuma no Kiss ni Ochiru, Osananajimi ni Amai Kiba",
