    "sinopse": "The male-only theatre company, 012 Flower Troupe, splits its actors into two groups: the elite \"New Moon,\" and the mediocre \"Zodiac Group.\" Although Hinataze Nozomu is a member of the Zodiac Group, he has the ability to compete against others to be the best. One day, he is selected to play the new Princess role alongside Ootori Kazatora, his greatest rival from the other division. During their lessons, this man told him, \"Not just in the script, fall for the real me.\" What will Nozomu do...?\n\n(Source: Girls' Generation Scanlations)",
