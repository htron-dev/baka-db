    "sinopse": "Jo is completely focused on her job as an accountant, which is apparently why her long-term boyfriend decided to leave her. Unable to handle the sorrow alone, she turns to her best friend, Liam, for comfort. He's always taken care of her when she was in pain, but now, for some reason, neither of them can contain their desire, and they end up spending the night together. The next morning before they part ways, they promise to forget the whole thing and stay friends. But now Jo is pregnant...and Liam is insisting they get married. Jo believes it's only for the sake of the baby, but could it mean more?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
