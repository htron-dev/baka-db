    "sinopse": "WHO FIGHTER is a WWII manga, with two complete stories and one short vignette. The title story tells the experience of a Japanese fighter pilot who shoots down a strange fireball over Japan during WWII. What follows is a strange and twisty tale, and the only thing more odd than the suspicious G-men investigating the incident is the fireball itself. Are the bizarre events that follow the result of this alien phenomenon, or are they all in the pilotâ€™s head. There is strong evidence to suggest both, which makes WHO FIGHTER an exciting and unique story, right up through the final frame.\nsource: vimanga.ru",
