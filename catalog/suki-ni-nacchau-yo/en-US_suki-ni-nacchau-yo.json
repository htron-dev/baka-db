    "sinopse": "College student \"Yul\" Yurugi develops DD, a conversational AI with the voice, personality, and manner of speaking modeled entirely after himself. To boost its conversational function, he entrusts DD to Manaka a gentleman and an expert in AI development. \"Your voice is lovely and sweet... I could fall for you.\" Yul eavesdrops on their training sessions but, the sweet words addressed to DD felt as if it's him that is being seduced, and his heart is now unwittingly pounding?\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)",
