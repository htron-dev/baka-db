In his classroom there is a girl he likes, Kanda Yayoi, who always scores the top and is popular among boys and girls.\n\nAfter going home from cleaning the classroom, he's met by his perverted/otaku sister who has him cross-play (cross-dressing cosplay) to go to an anime merchandise display, where he meets Yayoi who is also an otaku and she falls in love with his cosplay-persona...?\n\n(Source: MU)",
