## Sinopse

My name is Akari Mochizuki. I am a ninth grader, and in love with Wataru-kun, a member of the soccer club. He is very popular among girls, though he is quiet and even blunt. One day the ball he kicked hit me, and I've got a special power to be able to understand how a boy who kisses me feels.
