    "sinopse": "Gossips around town spoke of an urban legend called \"Kudan\". It is said that \"Kudan\" takes the form of a woman wearing western mourning dress. She lacks a right wrist, and her face is hidden behind a black veil. It is predicted that those who lay eyes on \"Kudan\", within 7 days calamity will befall them.\n\nThrough strange coincidence, 16 years old Sakuya Kudan meets cooking class instructor Touko Shima. As they come in contact with each other, faint feelings grow between the two. However, as Touko happened to come across the fearful \"Kudan\", her peaceful everyday life came to an end. As each day passed, \"Kudan\" kept creeping closer to her. Sakuya tries her best to protect her and attempts to find countermeasures.\n\nAt Kudan Girls High School, there's a club that focused on studying folklore. Together with the Mystery Research Club president, Koto Akinashi, Sakuya will take on the unknown folklore so as to protect her loved one.\n\n(Source: VNDB, edited)",
