## Sinopse

He's good-looking, he's suave and he comes from a rich family. Everything is all smooth-sailing in Sudou's life. Not to mention, he doesnâ€™t have a girl tying him down. He's got drama-free friends and a blossoming campus life. At least, that's how it was supposed to be. The highlight of his day is always teasing socially crippled Kishi, who shares the same seminar as him.

"What in the world am I doing!?"
