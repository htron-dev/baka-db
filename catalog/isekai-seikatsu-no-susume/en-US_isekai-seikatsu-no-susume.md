## Sinopse

Ordinary Earth guy Keitaro finds himself teleported to another world, and before he can get his bearings, he’s pounced on by an adorable half-devil. Nia is so excited to finally meet a human–she’s always wanted to make babies with one! Keitaro is at first determined to return home, but as he gets to know Nia, fellow devil-girl Rosette, and their pet dragon Lassie, he starts to feel at home. Cultures clash and attraction blossoms in this supernatural sexy comedy!
