By coincidence, he finds himself falling into Gigamax's rebirth into the wrestling scene. As he manages the team's comeback efforts, he gets mixed up with horny girl wrestlers, fends off team rivalries, and tries to unravel the mystery of what caused Gigamax to disband three years earlier.\n\n(Source: MU)",
