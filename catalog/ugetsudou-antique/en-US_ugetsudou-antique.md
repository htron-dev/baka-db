## Sinopse

The seeds of desire sprout in the depths of the body...

At a mysterious antique shop that appears only on rainy days, Sou Hayami finds a keepsake of his grandfather that he should have lost a long time ago. Sou asks the owner, Tsukiji, who has a strange atmosphere about him, to give it to him. However, this store does not deal in money.

With a fearless smile, Tsukiji gives his condition... "Please give birth to my child"?!
