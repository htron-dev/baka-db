## Sinopse

Johnny Ridden survived through the fierce battle of A Baoa Qu although his MS-14B Gelgoog High Mobility Type was badly damaged by the FA-78-1 Gundam Full Armor Type's overwhelming firepower. With the aid of a comrade, he reached a Dolos-class carrier where he was reunited with his MS-06R-2 Zaku II High Mobility Type, which was modified by a mechanic and nicknamed the MS-06R-2 Zaku II High Mobility Type "Full Bullet Zaku."
