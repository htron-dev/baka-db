## Sinopse

We've all been there—a couple drinks too many, and a hazy wander back to your home, where you wake up wondering how you got there. But in Kaede's case, not only was she not sure how she got home... she wasn't sure how the dinosaur got there, either! The two are soon fast friends, but though their personalities jive, they'll have to learn how to communicate in order to live peacefully together!
