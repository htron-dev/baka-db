## Sinopse

The up and downs of the good old school life♪~

Amane towers in height and possesses great physical strength. However, despite her appearance, she's really just a shy girl. When a male student man-handles an umbrella precious to her shorty after orientation, she ends up performing a shoulder throw on him! Late on the first day of class, Megumu rushes to school only to see a young girl throw a boy into the air. Shocked by what he just witnessed, he unintentionally blurts out the first thing that comes to mind: "Talk about scary!"

Quirky individuals start to gather around these two...could this be a sign of rocky times to come in their high school career? Join the tiny but chivalrous Megumu and Amane as the story of their ups and downs with friends and love at school unfolds!
