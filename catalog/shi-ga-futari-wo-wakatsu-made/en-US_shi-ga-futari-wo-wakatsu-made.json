In this day and age, the term \"prophet\" is outdated. \"Precog,\" as in precognition, is the modern term. Yet when the powers of precognition are graced upon a young girl named Tohyama Haruka, she is sought after by a powerful organization. Utilizing her powers, Haruka makes contact with Hijikata Mamoru, a blind swordsman. When cornered by her captors, Haruka proposes an outrageous condition to Mamoru. Haruka wants Mamoru to protect her until death do them part.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
