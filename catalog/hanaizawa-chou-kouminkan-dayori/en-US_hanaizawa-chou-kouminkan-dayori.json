    "sinopse": "Decades ago, the tiny town of Hanaizawa was cut off from the rest of the world by an invisible wall, a wall that nothing living can pass through. The younger residents have grown up only knowing the outside world through what they see and hear in the media. These are the stories of their everyday lives, the good and the bad, as they live out their days in a tiny town that no one can enter and no one can leave—a town which, by its isolated nature, is destined to fade away.\n\n(Source: Dead Scanlations)",
