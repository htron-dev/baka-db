    "sinopse": "Shuji Yashiro went to take pictures on the school rooftop rumored to be haunted by the ghosts of twins. That was where he met his classmate, Roku Ichinose, whom he always considered to be someone belonging to a completely different social world. He couldn't take his eyes off Roku's face, and took his picture on impulse. The following day, while he was organizing old photos in the clubroom, Shuji found a shocking photograph.\n\n(Source: MU)",
