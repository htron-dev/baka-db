    "sinopse": "From the 80's comes big hair, heavy metal and romance. High school throws everyone together, from shy and geeky bookworms to bawdy outrageous metalheads. These cliques can get very exclusive and people will seldom cross the lines, but when they do…everyone is watching. Will Leo the metalhead and Ayami the shy quiet girl ever realize that they were made for each other or will they remain glued to their little cliques.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
