## Sinopse

Prince Stefano was a man most girls could only dream of meeting. And now the very handsome-and very eligible-bachelor has come to America in search of the girl he will someday make his bride!

Hope Jordan's prince had finally come-but there is no happy ending in sight. Her royal suitor needs a wealthy wife to save his country from ruin, but Hope has nothing to offer Stefano except her love. Hope Jordan was the first woman to capture Stefano's soul, but will he give up his kingdom for her love?
