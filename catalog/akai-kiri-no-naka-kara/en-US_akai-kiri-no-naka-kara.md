## Sinopse

This work is a story about a boy, Rwanda, whose mother is a vicious murderer, set in England at the end of the 19th century. Rwanda, who has long been confined in the basement, grew up and left the house after a certain incident. Eventually, he arrived at the town and was picked up by a staff member of the nursing home and decided to live in the facility. But peaceful everyday life is only boring for Rwanda...
