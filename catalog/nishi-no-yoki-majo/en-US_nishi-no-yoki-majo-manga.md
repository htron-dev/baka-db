## Sinopse

Firiel is a 15-year-old girl who lives with her father, the astronomer Professor Dee, and their servants, the Holys. When she is invited to a fancy ball at a count's castle, she discovers that her past is more complicated then she had thought. A necklace given to her by her father proves that she is of royal blood—and a candidate to be the next Queen!
