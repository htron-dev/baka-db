## Sinopse

Based on Yoshi's hit novel series, "Deep Love" depicts the struggling life of Ayu, a 17-year-old high school girl who believes neither in a future nor the happiness it could bring her. By selling her body as a teenage prostitute, she's trying to justify her existence, which is as bleak as her heart: it's void of joy, sorrow, love. It's not until her encounter with a kind-hearted old lady that Ayu begins to realize the true meaning of happiness...
