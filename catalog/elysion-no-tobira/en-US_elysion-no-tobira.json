Ever since he was a child, he was loved for nothing but his music; it was as if it triggered a myseterious passion in people's hearts. At Kouichi's request, Gilbert decides once again to play the violin which he had long since given up, unable to refuse the request of the man he loves. But after hearing the sound of Elysion, Kouichi is enraptured by Gilbert's music, so much that he not only wants to dominate Gilbert's heart, but his very being...\n\n(Source: Bliss)",
