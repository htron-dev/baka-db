## Sinopse

Consists of two parts - Elysion no Oto (Sound of Elysion), and Elysion no Tobira (Door of Elysion).

Elysion no Oto: Gilbert Lorenz knows that he will never be able to obtain the heart of an emotionless man like Sudou Kouichi. Ever since he was a child, he was loved for nothing but his music; it was as if it triggered a myseterious passion in people's hearts. At Kouichi's request, Gilbert decides once again to play the violin which he had long since given up, unable to refuse the request of the man he loves. But after hearing the sound of Elysion, Kouichi is enraptured by Gilbert's music, so much that he not only wants to dominate Gilbert's heart, but his very being...
