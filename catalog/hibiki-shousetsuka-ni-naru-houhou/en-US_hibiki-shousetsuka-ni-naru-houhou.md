## Sinopse

The literature industry is suffering from the publishing recession. While the literary magazine "Mokuren" was grieving over the present state of affairs, a composition intended for their Newcomer's Award was sent to their editing department. However, it completely ignored the application rules. It should have been torn to shreds, but the work caught the eye of a sole editor. As a result, the world began to change.
