## Sinopse

Card Masters are individuals who have a contract with a single tarot card. Card Masters enjoy immortality. Card Masters wander in search of other gifted individuals. Card Masters also search for books possessed by spirits either of good or bad intentions. Join Keith and Alex as they journey through Europe completing tasks that only Card Masters can fulfill. If given the opportunity of immorality what would be your decision? Would you take it and live as Card Masters do or would you go on with your normal life, destined for death when the time comes?
