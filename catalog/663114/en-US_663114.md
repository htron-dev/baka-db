## Sinopse

663114 is a short but hard-hitting monologue of a 66-year-old cicada. The insect draws parallels between the catastrophes of Hiroshima and Fukushima and poses a fundamental question about the future of our planet.

66 is the number of years since Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed by Little Boy and Fat Man. 3/11 is the date of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and following disastrous tsunami. 4 is the number of reactors emitting radiation from the Fukushima Daichii plant.
