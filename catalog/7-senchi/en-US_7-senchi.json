    "sinopse": "One day, while in search for more food, our heroine stumbles upon a jar of what looked like umeboshi; little did she know that it would bring her more than just a full stomach. The mysterious snack somehow makes her shrink and she can only grow back when she eats something (which is a bit of a chore if you're THAT tiny). And if that's not troublesome enough, she's also dealing with her crush who seems to like her best friend!?\n\n(Source: Shoujo Crusade)",
