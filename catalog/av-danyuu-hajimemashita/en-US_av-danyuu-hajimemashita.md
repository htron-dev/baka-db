## Sinopse

When your company goes bankrupt and your marriage is on the rocks, what's a guy to do? Move to Tokyo to become an adult film star, of course! This diary-style comedy explores the pitfalls of an everyman who tries to break into the world of porno because it seems like a pleasurable way to restart his life. He soon learns that it's a harder job than he bargained for!
