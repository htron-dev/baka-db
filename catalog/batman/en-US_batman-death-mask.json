Does the murderer know Bruce Wayne is the Batman\n\nIssue 2: Bruce Wayne must confront his past and examine how the time he spent in Japan as a young man training to become Batman affected him...and whether his experiences then somehow led to the killer now rampaging throughout the underworld in Gotham.\n\nIssue 3: The mystery of the deadly masks is uncovered, as the killer reveals his long-standing deep-rooted connection to the Dark Knight and the time they spent together as students in Japan years ago.\n\nIssue 4: Events come to a head as the Batman must defeat the Oni — but before he can confront it, he must first face his own troubled past.\n\n(Source: DC Comics)",
