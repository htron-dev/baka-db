## Sinopse

While doing a news story in Gotham City, a documentary team from Tokyo films Batman as he rescues a group of hostages from the villianous Two-Face. The only problem is that Two-Face is still locked up in Arkham Asylum, and the man they captured is dead. Soon, other copies of Batman's famous rogues' gallery begin appearing all over Gotham, and the trail leads to a drug coming from Tokyo.
