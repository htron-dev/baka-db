## Sinopse

The main story is of a man who lets a homeless friend stay at his place. There's plenty of rumors about said friend; is there truth in any of it, or is he really a big liar?

Interspacing the chapters where the mangaka summarizes three gay films (one per chapter) is the story of a man whose novelist lover is impotent.

For the last chapter, a guy gets involved when his friend is in trouble with a shady organization.

None of the stories are light-hearted, and indeed, most of them are dark in nature. (from MangaUpdates)
