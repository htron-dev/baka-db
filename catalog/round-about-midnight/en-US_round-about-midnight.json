    "sinopse": "The main story is of a man who lets a homeless friend stay at his place. There's plenty of rumors about said friend; is there truth in any of it, or is he really a big liar?\n\nInterspacing the chapters where the mangaka summarizes three gay films (one per chapter) is the story of a man whose novelist lover is impotent.\n\nFor the last chapter, a guy gets involved when his friend is in trouble with a shady organization.\n\nNone of the stories are light-hearted, and indeed, most of them are dark in nature.
