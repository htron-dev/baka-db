## Sinopse

The young Samara delights in magic tricks, with which he hopes to attract girls. Unfortunately for him, however, he ends up getting the attention of a group of...Tokebi! The pretty yet mischievous elves Tokebi are part of Korean folklore: needless to say that this strange group will bring havoc in the life of the boy, giving us a delicate yet unpredictable sunjong manhwa.
