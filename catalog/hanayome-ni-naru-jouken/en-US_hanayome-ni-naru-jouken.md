## Sinopse

Italian millionaire Rafaello di Viscenti vows to marry the first woman he sees--who just happens to be Magda!

She's been desperately trying to make ends meet by cleaning Rafaello's house. His proposal of marriage comes with a large financial reward--all she has to do is spend six months as Rafaello's wife in name only.

But though Rafaello hadn't planned on sleeping with his new wife...he can't resist her!
