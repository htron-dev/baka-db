## Sinopse

In a world where dueling with guns is a popular sport, Hope Emerson would rather do away with the gun he inherited from his father, Peace Emerson, who had been a shooter for entertainment. He wants to give the gun to his older brother Cole, but first he has to find him.

Trouble follows Hope when he kills a dangerous gunfighter named Hans "Grim Reaper" Giles in a duel. Hans was a member of a mercenary outfit called the Crimson Executioners, whose leader is a millionaire named Philip Crimson. When Crimson's granddaughter, Nicola, seeks Hope's help in escaping the Executioners, he discovers that this young girl holds the key to a terrifying plan that could affect the entire world. With the help of a notorious gambler, a skilled duelist, and a daughter of aristocracy, Hope and Nicola set out to find the truth behind the Philip Crimson's Earthbound Project.
