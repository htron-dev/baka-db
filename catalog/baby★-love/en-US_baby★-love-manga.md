## Sinopse

As a little girl, Seara fell in love with Shuuhei, an older boy, but he looked down on her. Years later, when her parents temporarily relocate to the US, Seara takes the opportunity to move into the same house as him. Since Seara looks alot older than she actually is, Shuuhei doesn't recognize her right away. Will he ever recognize her? Will they ever find true love?
