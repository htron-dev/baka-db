    "sinopse": "There are gamblers out there who even bet their lives as ante. But to secure the integrity of these life-threatening gambles, a violent and powerful organization by the name of \"Kagerou\" referees these games as a neutral party. Follow Baku Madarame a.k.a. Usogui (The Lie Eater) as he gambles against maniacal opponents at games—such as Escape the Abandoned Building, Old Maid, and Hangman—to ultimately \"out-gamble\" and control the neutral organization of Kagerou itself.\n\n(Source: Easy Going Scans)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolumes 12–15: Igyou Tobakusha Usokui\nVolume 25: Yakou-san",
