## Sinopse

This is the story of a wuss named Mikito Sakurai who one day swallows the creation of a creature called Zakuro and becomes an "oni," a superhuman creature with a taste for human flesh. As Mikito is horrified by this change in his once gentle nature, he decides to leave on a journey with an oni-hunter in order to discover a way to turn back to normal.
