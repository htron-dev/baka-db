## Sinopse

Hoshino Fuzuki, a high school student, once experienced a weird accident when she was in the 3rd grade. Now, the weird accident is coming again. She can 'get in' to an animal, then can see from the eyes of that animal. Not only sight, but she can also feel other senses that belong to the animal. What is that power?
