## Sinopse

Mizcov is a 35-year-old Israeli who is a professor of Japanese literature in Tokyo. He is passionate about Japan, and is always searching for the so-called Japanese "kokoro" (spirit, soul), which seems to be lost but, in reality, still survives in certain places, people, and communities.
