    "sinopse": "These thoughts are hotter than flame, and deeper than the fallen snow. “I love Ichikawa-chan”. As his body burned at the other’s touch, the confession slipped out. Natsuki’s thoughts were always dwelling on his art teacher, Ichikawa. When he learned of Ichikawa’s sudden retirement, he tried to prevent it, but… From the art room tinted by their memories, their passionate sighs begin to fall. (Source: Attractive Fascinante)",
