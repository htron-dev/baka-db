Shuuichirou has been able to sense unworldly spirits for most of his life, and it has made him sensitive in his interactions with other people. When his adoptive mother passes away, Shuuichirou decides it's time to set out on his own to find a new life. On the way, he is targeted by a malicious spirit and passes out.
