Since we're not alone, we have to be brave.\"\n\nToda Erika’s shining star is rising... It’s a miracle of love.\n\nSakura is willing to do anything like wishing on a star because she wishes to grant her beloved Hirose's dream. This small deed is what attracts Sakura and Hirose to each other. For them, there's always a light in the darkness.\n\n(Souce: Midnight Scans)",
