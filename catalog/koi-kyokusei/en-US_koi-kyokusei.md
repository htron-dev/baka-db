## Sinopse

An overly touching love story of a miracle...

"One's "thought" is subject to change. A change in a human can change the world. Since we're not alone, we have to be brave."

Toda Erika’s shining star is rising... It’s a miracle of love.

Sakura is willing to do anything like wishing on a star because she wishes to grant her beloved Hirose's dream. This small deed is what attracts Sakura and Hirose to each other. For them, there's always a light in the darkness.

(Souce: Midnight Scans)
