    "sinopse": "Tatsuru Hayama loves long, luscious locks drape like the person's sitting next to him or, rather, sleeping on his shoulder. After the person wakes up in a nervous spurt, Hayama runs off the last train he could take to get home. From that day forward, before he knows it, his eyes start searching for the person with the soft, long hair. What will Hayama do when the person he runs into isn't an elegant, long-haired angel but a suspicious guy with a buzzcut? First, save his cat. The lives of a med student, a loan shark, and a playful cat come together in an instrumental story with little to no written narrative...\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
