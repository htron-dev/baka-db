    "sinopse": "Set in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Zhu Yingtai is a young lady from a noble family who disguises herself as a man in order to study. On the way she meets Liang Shanbo and they become sworn brothers. Yingtai falls in love with Shanbo, but Shanbo always thought that she was a guy, and when he FINALLY finds out that Yingtai is a girl, her parents have already arranged a marriage for her...\n\nThis Chinese legend is equivalent to Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet.\n\n(Source: misOramen)",
