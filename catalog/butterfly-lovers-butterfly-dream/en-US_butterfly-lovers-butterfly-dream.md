## Sinopse

Set in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Zhu Yingtai is a young lady from a noble family who disguises herself as a man in order to study. On the way she meets Liang Shanbo and they become sworn brothers. Yingtai falls in love with Shanbo, but Shanbo always thought that she was a guy, and when he FINALLY finds out that Yingtai is a girl, her parents have already arranged a marriage for her...

This Chinese legend is equivalent to Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet.
