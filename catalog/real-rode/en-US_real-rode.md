## Sinopse

Nina is popular, fashionable, and dating one of the coolest guys in school... But no one knows that she's secretly crazy for video games! When she's playing her favorite, Rode, for the hundredth time, something strange happens--she falls asleep, and wakes up to a cat telling her she's actually been transported to Rode! It's all just a dream... right?
