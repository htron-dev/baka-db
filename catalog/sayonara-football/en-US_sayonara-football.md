## Sinopse

Onda Nozomi is in her second year on the middle school soccer team but has yet to play a single game because she is a girl. Growing up playing soccer, she has the technical skills, endurance and the elegance. However, as a girl, she can't overcome the physical difference and she can see all her male teammates that she grew up playing soccer with get further and further away from her. Even her younger brother, Junpei, who is also on the team, is starting to rise above her. Coach Samejima sees that Nozomi is an amazing player but because soccer is such a physical sport, he can't let her play. Nozomi isn't the kind of girl that just gives up so she practices harder than anyone and drives the team in the hopes of one day playing in a game.
