## Sinopse

All too aware of being "just a teenager," Chiho is willing to do what it takes to confess her love to Somei-sensei, her teacher and the guy of her dreams. Still haunted by nightmares of a confession gone wrong years ago, she hopes for some high school romance...but wait, the nightmare himself is back, and he's going to her high school?! Things just got a whole lot more complicated for Chiho...
