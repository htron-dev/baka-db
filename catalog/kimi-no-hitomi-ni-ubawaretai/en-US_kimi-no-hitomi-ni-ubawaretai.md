## Sinopse

Jun, a photographer, meets Haruka while they were both working at a wedding hall. Haruka's persona for work and his true personality are very different. Enchanted by Haruka's natural smile, Jun blurts out, "Will you be mine?" He was so sure that he scared Haruka away, but he received an unexpected response back.
