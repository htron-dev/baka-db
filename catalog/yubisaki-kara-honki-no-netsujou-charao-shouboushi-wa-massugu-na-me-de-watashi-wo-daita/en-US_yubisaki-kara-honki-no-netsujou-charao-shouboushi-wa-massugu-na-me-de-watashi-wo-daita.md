## Sinopse

A fire can have devastating effects on a person, but although she lost all of her possessions when her apartment caught on fire, Ryou Fujihashi is able to move on quickly. This is due mostly to her childhood friend and local firefighter, Souma Mizuno, letting her stay with him. But Ryou knows that Souma is a playboy, so she immediately attempts to set up boundaries to keep his wandering hands away from her.

However, Ryou begins to enjoy Souma's advances, and the places his hands wander begin to crave his touch, turning the smoldering lust within her into a blazing inferno.
