## Sinopse

Donald Duck works for the American furniture company "Duck Furniture". It has already been two months since he was transferred to the Asian Cultural Distribution Department, which has only three people: his subordinates, José Carioca and Panchito. One day, they receive a sudden phone call from the company president. What are the instructions that they were given by the president...? What is Japan, what is hospitality, and how does it work?

Donald's swashbuckling hot spring adventure opens on the stage of Yukawakusa, the first place! Will the three be able to safely return to New York?!
