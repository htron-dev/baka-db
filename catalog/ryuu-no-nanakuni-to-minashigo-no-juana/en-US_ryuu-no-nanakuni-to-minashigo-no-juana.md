## Sinopse

In a fantastical future, humans are no longer the dominant species–dragons have evolved to become rulers of the world we once knew. One day, an archaeologist from the Dragonewt race who's fascinated with his studies of the past finds a young human girl. He decides to adopt her, giving her the name Fauna, and together they explore their magical world of the Seven Kingdoms.
