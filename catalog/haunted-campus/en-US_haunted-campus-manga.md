## Sinopse

The story follows Mototsu Yagami, a college student who can see ghosts but doesn't want to. In college, he meets Koyomi Nada, who was his junior in high school. Out of unrequited love for her, he follows her into the "occult research society," which is full of eccentrics who fill their campus life with the occult.
