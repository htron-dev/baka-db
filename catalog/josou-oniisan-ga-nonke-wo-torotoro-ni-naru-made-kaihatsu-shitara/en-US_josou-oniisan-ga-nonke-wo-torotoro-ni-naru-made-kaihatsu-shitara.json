    "sinopse": "How can someone so nice and pretty get turned on by someone like me?\n\nEver since he was groped on the train, college student Kei's been scared of men. But, the incident also left him hungering for taboo pleasures... Driven by the raging conflict between his mind and body, Kei visits a crossdresser \"massage\" parlor. There, he finds himself opening up completely to a \"gal\" named Nana, despite knowing there's a guy under those clothes. Kei's overwhelmed at first by his body's sheer sensitivity, but he soon starts wanting it... deeper. Blushing and hesitant, he musters the courage to spread his legs for Nana...!\n\n\"We only just met, and my finger's practically making you melt... Oh my god, Kei. You're coming so hard with your whole body.\"\n\nAn innocent college student with a weakness for pleasure seeks a lesson in bottom play from a masterful crossdresser!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
