    "sinopse": "Sagami enjoys the life that comes with being Japan’s hottest model. He’s rich, handsome, famous…and dating his agent?! Their secret affair should make working together a dream come true, but Sagami can’t seem to keep business and pleasure separate. How can they keep things quiet when Sagami even gets jealous over the way Takumi treats his clients? Whether it’s his complaining about not having enough time together because of their busy schedules, his antics on formal occasions or his unbridled passion when they’re alone (even on set!), Takumi has a lot more to manage than just Sagami’s career.\n\n(Source: DMG)",
