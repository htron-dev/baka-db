## Sinopse

Minato and Shou used to live together since she lives with her grandfather and he's the son he adopted. Although they are not blood related, a romantic involvement is strictly forbidden. But why does Minato feels so lonely ever since Shou moved away to live on his own? Is it love she's feeling? Also, what about Shou...how does he feel about Minato? He seems to be very protective of her, even when it's not really needed. But now Minato found out Shou is going to work in France as a hairdresser. What can she do to stop him?
