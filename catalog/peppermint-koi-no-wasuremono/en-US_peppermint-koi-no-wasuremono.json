He immediately becomes smitten with his senpai, Haruto and inevitably falls deeply in love with him. Thinking Takuya only needs someone to listen to his troubles, Haruto invites Takuya to his place. Out of pent-up frustration, Takuya confesses his feeling for Haruto! But Haruto warns him, \"Just don’t fall in love with me\"—!?\n\n(Source: Fantasy Shrine)",
