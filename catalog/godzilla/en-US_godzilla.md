## Sinopse

Something monstrous rises up from the sea and nearly sinks a Japanese fishing boat. The sole survivor tells a tale that no one wants to believe.

But when a Russian nuclear submarine is destroyed in the same waters, the world is forced to face the truth: Godzilla has returned! This manga classic was originally published by Dark Horse in black and white in 1988
