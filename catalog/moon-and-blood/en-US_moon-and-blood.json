His temporary stay in her household and attendance to Sayaka's school is more than she's bargained for. But what secrets does Kai hold? What are his true intentions for his sudden appearance into Sayaka's life? Where does he disappear to every night? And what's up with that black cat?\n(Source: DMP).",
