## Sinopse

Three one-shots by Shiina Karuho.

Aoi Futari:
A funny, sweet, touching story about a girl and a guy who have just begun dating. They each pretend to be calm and in control, but what are they really thinking?

Hana to Thief:
Miyata Azumi met Ooki in grade school. Azumi was grabbing a flower from Ooki's yard when Ooki caught her red-handed. Ever since then, she's avoided him out of embarrassment. Now in high school, will things change?

Katakoi Juliet:
Jurie and Romio have a lot in common. Both their parents own rival stores in town, both have silly names from Shakespeare's play, and both have trouble getting along with each other. Are they as ill-fated as their namesakes?
