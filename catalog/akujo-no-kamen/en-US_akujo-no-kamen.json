    "sinopse": "Martha is working as a scantily clad server at a whiskey industry event when she meets Simon, a businessman who's none too impressed with her. After he accuses her of being a prostitute, she douses him with a glass of champagne... only for him to turn around and invite her to dinner! They're hitting it off before she knows it, but their blissful fling comes to an abrupt end when he tells her he's heading back to England. Three years later, they meet again. She may be shocked by their surprise reunion, but her heart can't help but race when she sees he's as attractive as ever. And just when she'd told herself she'd stay away from men like Simon...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
