## Sinopse

The hit comic Attack on Titan is now a 4-panel comic! Eren and Mikasa and Levi and the Titans shrink down and go wild?! So you, who says, "I love 'Attack!'" And you, who says, "I'm scared of 'Attack!!'" Give our "Spoof" a try! It's now a 4-panel comic that will annihilate the sides of anyone who reads it!
