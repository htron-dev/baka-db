    "sinopse": "With perfection idolized by subordinated and capable to the point of being teased, Kanzaki is a normal salaryman. For him, there was something he can't tell anyone about, a night that he can't forget... That is, his passionate days spent with Nagi, a male prostitute that he had a relationship with five years ago. However, that had also ended... After coming home from an overseas assignment, Kanzaki meets a subordinate within his company named Futagami that looks exactly like Nagi. Frozen time begins to move again in Takiba's drawn sensitive love!\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)",
