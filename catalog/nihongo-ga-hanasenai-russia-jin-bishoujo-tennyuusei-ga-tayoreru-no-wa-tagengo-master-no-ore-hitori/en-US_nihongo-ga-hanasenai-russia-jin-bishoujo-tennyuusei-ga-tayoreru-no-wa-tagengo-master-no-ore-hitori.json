    "sinopse": "Tina, a super-cute Russian, has transferred into the class. She is immediately popular but does not speak Japanese, so she is troubled and looks like she is about to burst out crying. In such a case, the only one she can rely on is the main character Iori, who is hated by everyone due to a certain misunderstanding.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
