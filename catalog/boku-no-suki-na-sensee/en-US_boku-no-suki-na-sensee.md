## Sinopse

Fudou Shinobu is a young man that is accustomed to success in all he does. However, after graduating from university at the top of his class, the only employment he can find is as a preschool teacher. Shinobu is not very good at dealing with kids, though he should be more elite than everyone around him. Luckily, his part-time high-schooler assistant, Edogawa Heiji, is there to help. This 4-koma follows the 'elite' Shinobu's humorous daily difficulties in handling his new position as a preschool teacher!
