    "sinopse": "This anime was made by Hudson Soft, which created the \"Star Soldier\" game. Its designer, Yoichi Takahashi, appeared in a cameo and sang the theme songs.\n\nBy coincidence, the film was released the same day as \"Super Mario Brothers,\" also based on a video game.\n\nThe film was a box-office failure in Japan.\n\n(Source: bcdb.com/)",
