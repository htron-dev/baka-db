## Sinopse

This anime was made by Hudson Soft, which created the "Star Soldier" game. Its designer, Yoichi Takahashi, appeared in a cameo and sang the theme songs.

By coincidence, the film was released the same day as "Super Mario Brothers," also based on a video game.

The film was a box-office failure in Japan.
