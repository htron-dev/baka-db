    "sinopse": "Makoto has always looked up to his cool older cousin, Toshi. After all, it was the movie-obsessed Toshi that told him to never settle for being a boring adult. But now that Makoto's a teenager, he senses a big change in Toshi's outlook. Could it be that his freedom-loving cousin has given up on his dream of making movies? Only a look back into the highs and lows of Toshi's wild days with his school's Film Club can part the curtains on this made-for-the-big-screen mystery!\n\n(Source: Juné Manga)",
