Upon discovering the existence of the Goddess of Destruction he resurrected her, but this only lead to the destruction of his own country. As a result of the carnage, she was sealed in a box that was kept in a very deep, dark place. The box was locked with many keys, keys that were then spread across the world. Many years later a Samurai discovered the box and decided to challenge the Goddess of Destruction, but first he had to gather all the keys and fight through hordes of undead soldiers. Can you really defeat a Goddess? A brand new Manga based on the new film Death Trance, by the creators of Versus!\n\n(Source: Media Blasters)",
