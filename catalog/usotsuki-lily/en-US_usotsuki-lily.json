    "sinopse": "Hinata Saotome is suddenly asked out by En Shinohara, a gorgeous boy in her grade. What she doesn't know though, is that his hobby is cross-dressing! En has always hated men, and whenever he sees his own reflection, he punches out whatever is doing the reflecting (windows, mirrors...). To combat this hatred, he dresses up as a girl. Hinata decides to go out with him anyway, despite his weird hobby.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 8: Sweets Honey\nVolume 17: Amber",
