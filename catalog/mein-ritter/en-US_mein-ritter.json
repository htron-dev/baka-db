His search leads him to viscount Theodore, a young, prodigious but hot-tempered and grouchy young man, fluent in 8 languages and a popular author of illusionary stories. To make things more interesting, not only does the viscount not believe in anything paranormal but the letter was apparently delivered to Andrea by fairies...?!",
