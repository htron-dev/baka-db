    "sinopse": "Long ago a magical cat disguised as a human woman fell in love with a human man. It is said that during their time together they even had children. They say that afterwards, the magical cat dwelt happily as a human, that she ascended to the heavens and became a cat-god, and is even now watching over the world of cats and men.\n\nOf those descendants, the cats of Cat Forest Town say that they have mysterious powers. The townsfolk care for the cats as their guardian deities, and the cats, too, have become attached to the humans.\n\n(Source: MU)",
