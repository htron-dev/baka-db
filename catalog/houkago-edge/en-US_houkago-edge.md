## Sinopse

Tobari's always loved cute and feminine things. Which sparks his eventual venture into drag. One day, while he was out in public dressed as a high school girl, he bumps into fellow classmate, Inui. It's annoying to Tobari how amusing Inui finds it, but at least he's promised not to tell anyone. But with no plans of letting him off for this hobby, Inui proposes something outrageous. He is twisted and unstable, but for some reason, his words are reassuring. A story of a secret love woven with something unnerving.
