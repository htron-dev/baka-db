    "sinopse": "Since he was a kid, animal groomer Mamoru has been able to see animals' souls in human form. They haven't ever spoken back, though... until now! One of Mamoru's favorite customers is a tiny chihuahua called \"Chappy,\" who Mamoru sees as a large, perpetually annoyed young man. When his owner gets hospitalized, Mamoru sneaks Chappy into his apartment—only for the tiny dog to turn into a big dude and confess that he's a werewolf!\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Color",
