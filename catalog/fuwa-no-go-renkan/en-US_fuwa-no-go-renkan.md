## Sinopse

Fuwa Beibei encounters the severely injured goddess, Athena. In order to help Athena regain strength, Beibei sets out to find a mysterious wooden box left by Coubertin in 1894, but the worrying thing is that Pixiu who injured his stomach from his glutinous eating habits heard this news too. He thought that this mysterious energy could not only cure his stomach, but also improve his magic, and such begins the journey through time and space of two spirits with different aims. After all the hardships, they found the sixth son of the dragon - Bixi, and after the two's efforts in passing his test, Bixi carries them along 100 years of Olympic history.
