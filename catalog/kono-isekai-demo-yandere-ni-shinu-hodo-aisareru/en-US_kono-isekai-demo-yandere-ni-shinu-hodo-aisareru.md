## Sinopse

I had known for most of my life that I would be killed by a Yandere and now, that day has finally come—or that should have been what happened. Instead, I was reincarnated by a Goddess in a game-like world.

I jumped at the opportunity to live a normal, peaceful life with ordinary girls... Now I have a skill that awakens Yanderes!? The world the Goddess created specializes in Yanderes!?

On top of that, in order to gain a certain cheat ability, I was born with a body that can’t harm women no matter what they do to me... I wanted a peaceful life in this world, but it seems even in a different world I will be loved to death by Yanderes.
