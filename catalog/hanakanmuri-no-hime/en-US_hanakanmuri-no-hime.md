## Sinopse

This volume consists of three short stories involving a different princess and a mysterious exorcist. All stories deal with a central theme of foregoing sorrow and the appreciation/affirmation of what one has in life:

The Golden Phoenix, The Silver Phoenix - A princess longs for a lost love and almost loses her life until a mysterious exorcist opens her heart and mind to the truth and to what has been right in front of her all along.

The Hime with the Flower Crown - A young princess learns with the help of a mysterious young boy that putting away childish things may ultimately lead to a fulfilling new world and to the fulfilment of her beloved father's wish.

Memories of a Flower - While trying to solve the mystery behind the ghostly apparition of his beloved princess, a young man learns to ease his own sadness. (Source: M-U)
