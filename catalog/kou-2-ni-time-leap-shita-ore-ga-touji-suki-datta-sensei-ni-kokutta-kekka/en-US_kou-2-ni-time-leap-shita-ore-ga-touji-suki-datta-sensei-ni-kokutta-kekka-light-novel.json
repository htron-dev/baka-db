    "sinopse": "I was a corporate worker in my 30s, when I woke up and found that I had time leaped to the spring of my second year of high school. At the time, there was a teacher that I had regretted not confessing to, so I confessed to her in the heat of the moment, and now we’re dating! However, the teacher is one who would make any man a good for nothing person, so I end up being spoiled by her a lot.\n\nWhile secretly dating my overworked teacher (lover), a sweet school life filled with flirting awaits.\n\n(Source: SB Creative, translated)",
