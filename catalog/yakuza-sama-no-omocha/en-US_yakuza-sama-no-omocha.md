## Sinopse

"Maybe I should have thought harder about whom I ask for help. Perhaps it would have been better to implore god to save me." That's what Ogiwara thought when he was rescued from a debt by a regular customer from the bar he works at. He pays the debt of Ogiwara's disappeared friend, but what does he want in return?

Included one-shot:
Volume 1: Hana no Akuta
