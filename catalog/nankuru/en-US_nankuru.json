    "sinopse": "On Japan's most western outlying island——\n\nOn the island's only middle school, the entire student population consisted of merely four people. And they're all guys. To make it worse, having a bunch of guys on this weak spirited southern country, there's nothing to do but play, skip school and waste away! In a way this is the ideal hometown....? How can that be true!! This is the unreasonable daily life of the people of the southern country, and Miyako who had finally come from the city and lives by his own unique set of rules.",
