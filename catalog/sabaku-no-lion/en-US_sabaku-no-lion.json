    "sinopse": "Based on Barbara Faith' novel \"Lion of the Desert\"\n\nThere was something about Sheik Karm al-Raji that frightened Diane St. James. Still, she owed him her life! And as they crossed the vast desert on their way toward Rashdani and freedom, she began to fall under the spell of Karim's dark, dangerous eyes... Diane St. James was the most beautiful woman Karim had ever seen - one look at her glorious red-gold hair and he knew she'd be his woman! He'd promised her father he'd bring her home, but Diane belonged to him now. How could het ever let her go?\n\n(Source: Fictiondb)",
