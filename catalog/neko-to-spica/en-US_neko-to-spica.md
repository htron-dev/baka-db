## Sinopse

Salaryman Kouta Kawamura hates troublesome things. The only exception is the black stray cat that likes to sit in front of his apartment. One day he stumbles upon a black-haired boy who seems to have replaced his favourite cat. When the boy collapses in front of Kouta, he decides to take him in on a whim. What will happen to Kouta's trouble-free everyday life?
