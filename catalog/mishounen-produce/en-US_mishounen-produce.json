    "sinopse": "It's the start of high school, and bookworm Kako decides to \"produce\" her country bumpkin childhood friend, Kousei, so that he can become a good-looking and popular school idol. She models him after Lawrence, a character in a manga she likes, but as Kousei's transformation becomes a huge success and he extends his new character beyond what she asks for, what will Kako do? Will she find herself left behind in the wake of his newly found popularity?\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 4: Megane Danshi Shinkasetsu (Theory of Evolution for Guys with Glasses)",
