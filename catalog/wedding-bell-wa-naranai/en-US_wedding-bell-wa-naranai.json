    "sinopse": "On the day of her wedding, Shaan is told by her groom-to-be, Piers, that he loves another woman before he abandons her at the altar. Piers's brother Rafe suddenly appears and takes Shaan as his own wife. Shaan can hardly believe that the handsome billionaire would marry her, the ex-fiancée of his younger brother. But Rafe is determined to cover up Piers's mistake and save his family's honor, even if that means entering into a loveless marriage. For her part, Shaan doesn't want to be known as the throwaway bride, so she agrees to go along with Rafe's plan.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
