It's nicknamed \"Bakajona\".\n\nWith delinquents around every 360 degrees at this school, the long-discontinued broadcasting club is being brought back! Or something like that.\n\nBut it's too impossible. Because we're just a bunch of delinquents. Plus we don't have any experience with broadcasting. Ah, we just want to meet and be popular with cute girls!",
