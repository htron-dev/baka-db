    "sinopse": "Welcome to Sales Department Two, where all the employees are women... that is, until Mr. Amano, a shy dreamer who perpetually spins off into homoerotic fantasies, and Mr. Kakimoto, the persistent wanna-be husband of Mr. Amano, are transferred in. Don't worry; the women are on it!\n\nElsewhere in town, a waiter gushes with daily public affection and special meals for his high-strung paramour, while their friend has trouble swallowing an extra helping of violent flirting every lunch hour. Mix in a cocky waitress, a brash interloper, an old guy who won't listen to reason, and what do you get?\n\nReality explodes in the unique vignettes of FANTASY PARADISE!\n\n(Source: DMG)",
