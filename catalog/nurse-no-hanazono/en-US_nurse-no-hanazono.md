## Sinopse

After a very "intimate" accident, crafty Shouma lands in an all-female clinic for a round of special care! But he's convinced that the only medicine he truly needs is the sweet love of every gorgeous woman who crosses his path. Will Shouma make his way into the hearts (and beds) of an entire hospital? Buy-me copy: Nurse's Paradise perfects its bedside manner with a host of saucy, sexy nurses... and even a prowling patient! Can a crazy young guy keep his hands to himself and his health on the mend... or will he cave to the teasing invitations of a team of adventurous aides?
