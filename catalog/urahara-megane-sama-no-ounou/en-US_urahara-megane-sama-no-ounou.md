## Sinopse

Yutaka is a designer who does remote work and hates the sun. In fact, the only sunshine he needs in his life is his old childhood friend, Akira, a shop clerk at a glasses shop with an ultra positive spirit. If only Akira knew how much Yutaka yearned for him... But what would that do? Akira is straight... A love story between a straight sweetheart and a successful designer who doesn't know how to open his heart!
