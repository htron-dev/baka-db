## Sinopse

Rika and Monodani have just entered high school, and are looking for clubs to join. It is here that they come across the "Culture Research Club" run by two senpai.

This is the beginning of Rika's high school love... a love that is one-sided. How will she cope with the problems of loving someone who also has a one-sided love? Can hard work truly pay off in love, or must she move on to a different love?
