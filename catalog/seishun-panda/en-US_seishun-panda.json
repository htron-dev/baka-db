    "sinopse": "Nagisa and her beautiful, intelligent best friend Yumi couldn’t be more different. Of course, her childhood friend, Ryou, is always happy to point this out whenever he can. When Yumi gets a crush on the equally intelligent and handsome Kei, Nagisa is determined to get the two of them together like any good best friend would, but it seems that Kei likes Nagisa’s outgoing personality more than Yumi’s shy one. And where does Ryou’s crush on Nagisa–and the one she may have on him–fit into all of this?\n\n(Source: MU)",
