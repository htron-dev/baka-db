## Sinopse

After a fateful encounter with the gorgeous and mature Honoka, chemistry-major Keita is unable to tell her how he feels before getting sucked into an unexpected relationship with Aya, a sweet but oblivious underclassman! Both girls are incredibly beautiful, and even though their personalities are so different, Keita discovers he really cares for them both... But it's not okay to have two girls at once, right?!
