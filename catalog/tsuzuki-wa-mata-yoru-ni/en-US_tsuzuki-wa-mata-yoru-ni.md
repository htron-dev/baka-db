## Sinopse

Popular host Akusawa Fumi and renowned detective Futagami Takaharu have been classmates throughout high school and college, and also been lovers at some point. They met again two years ago, and have since rekindled their sexual relationship. And while it proved to be as hot and fierce as ever, in truth there might perhaps still be a little more to it than just that..?
