The first one is about Rune's dream about everyone dressed in drag, the second is about a little adventure that the three dragons go on, and then the third is like a day in the life of Alfeegi, Ri-ma, and Duma.\n\nTitle: Crescendo\nSummary: Backstory about how Lykouleon and Kaistern met and how Kaistern then became the Blue Dragon Officer.\n\nTitle: CONFESSION - Thats\nSummary: This is basically the backstory of Thatz and how he knew about Rath's little secret.\n\nTitle: CONFESSION - Rath\nSummary: The final gaiden published by Ohkami through WINGS.
