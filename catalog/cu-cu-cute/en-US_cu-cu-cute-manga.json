    "sinopse": "Kasuga Rito had a hidden wish for a very long time: to use his ability for good and to help people. But before he could do that, he needed to gain the power of magic first.\n\nRito is a sophomore in Rezon Institute, a school for people with special magic abilities to find, train, and develop their skills. Each student has to reach 100 points to be able to start using their ability. Otherwise they won't move up from the \"Common\" and into the \"Starlight\" class. But Rito, known as \"the Eternal 99\", has been stuck with an unchanging 99 points for a long time.\n\nSo here comes his new plan: to become a friend with Scuse Fontana, a three-day exchange student from the Demon World, and to ask her for some food. (There's rumor that a human can increase his power by eating food from the Demon World). He slipped into the hotel where a welcome party is being held for the much respected lady, just to find that she's actually absent. Losing hope, he wastes no time leaving the hotel. At the back alley behind the hotel, he finds a tiny dragon, which for some reason sticks to his head and now he can't get it off...\n\n(Source: MU)",
