    "sinopse": "Kekkai Sensen centers around the crime-fighting organization \"Libra\" and their battles in Hellsalem's Lot, formerly known as New York City. Hellsalem's Lot was created in a single night when a portal to the \"Beyond\" opened, and now it is a paranormal melting pot of monsters, magic, and the everyday mundane city life. It's up to Libra to prevent the horrors of this city from spreading to the outside world.\n\nWhen mild-mannered Leonard Watch arrives in the city, he's inducted into Libra and things spiral out of control from there.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
