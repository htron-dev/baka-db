    "sinopse": "Marc was dangerous to her in the way that only a strong, sexy male could be to a woman. Even knowing that, she'd agreed to marry him\n\nHope blossomed in Hira's heart. Perhaps she'd married a man with whom it might just be worth building a life. Her mother had worried that he was scarred, but the lines on his face did nothing to lessen his raw masculine appeal. If anything, they gave him an even more dangerous male air, enticing the feminine core of her to thoughts that shocked her.\n\nWhat did a man's face matter anyway? She had no use for handsome men.\n\nBut for a man with a heart?\n\nFor such a man...she might risk everything.",
