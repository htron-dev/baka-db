## Sinopse

This story begins at the end of the Meiji era. A story that creates a new breeze in a rustic long-established kimono store.

A long-established kimono store Mitsuboshi (Three Stars) that once showed a great bustle. The third son, Torasaburou Hoshino, returned from England for the first time in three years. Although he's eager to make a new "three-star," he is not welcomed by the shopkeepers. On the other hand, the mysterious man, Takatou, seems to know Torasaburou is moving independently to rebuild the Mitsuboshi business...
