## Sinopse

At the young age of 30, Arisawa Riku was already an obstinate father. But did being raised strictly send his high school-aged son, Tomoki, down the path of homosexuality?! “I forbid it, Tomoki!” However, Tomoki and Naoya-sempai will fight for the sake of their love! This theatrical romance takes place in the noisy living room of the Arisawa household.
