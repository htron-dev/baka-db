## Sinopse

Leica is a princess from the Holy Wadu Empire. Nadeshiko is a high schooler with boy problems. The two are bound by an ancient pact that was activated when Nadeshiko unwittingly released Leica into her world. Now Nadeshiko's world has been turned upside down as ghosts and magic suddenly stop being the stuff of fantasy and start becoming everyday occurrences. When a strange spirit appears and targets Leica, Nadeshiko is dragged into a war she knows nothing about. Will Leica survive this fight? Will Nadeshiko survive Leica with her chest intact? Who is the mysterious spirit that keeps targeting the two girls? The answer to these questions and more are waiting in the pages of Ayumi Hattori's hit, Her Witch. Sometimes love can be a real witch.
