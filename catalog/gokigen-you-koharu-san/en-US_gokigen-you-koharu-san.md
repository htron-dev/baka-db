## Sinopse

Outside of working at a maid cafe, 19-year-old Koharu obsesses over online live streaming, even cutting into her sleep to do so. With the click of a button, she enjoys chatting with hundreds of friends and followers around the world every evening. Until recently, streaming has been enough to satisfy Koharu. However, having been single for three and a half years, she has yet to experience her dream—an ordinary love.

When a fan visiting Koharu's workplace ends with a splashed drink on her face, Koharu later receives a direct message apologizing for the behavior. The next day at the cafe, a customer named Shun introduces himself as the sender and tells Koharu he will watch her next stream. As Shun continues to meet Koharu both online and offline, Koharu begins to think her wish just might come true.
