    "sinopse": "Noboru idolizes the actor Tsubasa Kuriwaki. When he was young, he saw Kuriwaki at a film shoot, and the sight of him working earnestly was unforgettable. But one day, when Noboru went to his classroom to pick up something he forgot, he sees Kuriwaki crossdressing! He panics and tries to run away, but is hit with a blunt object and becomes the subject of some compromising photos. Thus begins Noboru's new life as Kuriwaki's manservant.\n\n(Source: East Press, translated)",
