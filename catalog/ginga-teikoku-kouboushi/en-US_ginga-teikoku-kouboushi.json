    "sinopse": "This is a manga adaptation of Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation,\" a classic science fiction novel and the first published novel of the Foundation series. The story begins when the young mathematician Gaal Dornick arrives on Trantor, the capitol planet of a 12,000-year-old galactic empire, at the invitation of Hari Seldon. Hari Seldon is a mathematician who developed the science of psychohistory, which combines history, sociology, and statistics in order to make predictions about the future of large groups of people.\n\nTo Gaal's surprise, he and Hari Seldon are arrested for treason shortly after his arrival! Hari Seldon has made a prediction that the Empire will fall in 500 years, after which there will be a 30,000 year dark age. He claims that nothing can be done about the fall, but that he can use his knowledge of psychohistory to shorten the following dark age to 1,000 years. The Empire's rulers are not thrilled with this news, and they exile Hari, Gaal and others who are involved to the remote planet of Terminus.\n\nThus begins the Foundation, which must endure through the end of the Empire, and follow Seldon's plan to bring humanity through on the best possible path!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
