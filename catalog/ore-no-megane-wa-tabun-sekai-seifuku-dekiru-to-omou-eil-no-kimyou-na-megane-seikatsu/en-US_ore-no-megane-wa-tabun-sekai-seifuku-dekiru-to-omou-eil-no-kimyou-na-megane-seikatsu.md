## Sinopse

Eil is an apprentice hunter from the village Albat who hates being the target of attention. Upon becoming 15, at the Ceremony of Determination that he needs to go through to be acknowledged as an adult, he is determined to possess the "Talent for Glasses."

For glasses? What does that even mean?

But gradually, Eil discovers the countless possibilities hidden within his glasses, one at a time.

"I think these glasses might actually enable me to conquer the whole world. Not that I'm going to do it, though."

Thus begins the bizarre glasses life of Eil, the young glasses man.
