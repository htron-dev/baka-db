Upon becoming 15, at the Ceremony of Determination that he needs to go through to be acknowledged as an adult, he is determined to possess the \"Talent for Glasses.\"\n\nFor glasses?

Not that I'm going to do it, though.\"\n\nThus begins the bizarre glasses life of Eil, the young glasses man.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
