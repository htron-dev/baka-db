The ones who possess the true ability are said to be granted great honor as well as deathâ€¦ What awaits these children is jealous rivals, arguments with their mothers, forbidden love, and both confidence and confusion over their own abilities. The story of the unfolding powers of the boys who have the voices of angels.\n\n(Source: MU)",
