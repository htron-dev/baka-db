## Sinopse

Ash and Kijira have spent three years slaying demons alongside the famous hero Leon, but when he abandons them for cute, young women, the pair is shocked and enraged. As a result, Ash and Kijira train rigorously, intent on defeating the Demon Lord and his forces before Leon can. Fueled by spite and envy, the two warriors aim to make Leon regret his decision to remove them from his party!
