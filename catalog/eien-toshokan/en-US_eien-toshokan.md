## Sinopse

There is a library in the void between the Heavens and Outer Space. This library has all the knowledge and wisdom gathered throughout the entire universe that ever was or ever will be, which is why it's called the Eternal Library. In this library, there is a girl aiming to become the Moon Path Librarian "Velvet," and her other goal is to read the first book of all time.
