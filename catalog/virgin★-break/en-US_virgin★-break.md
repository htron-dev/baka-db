## Sinopse

The opening chapter (title story) focuses on two friends in the gay AV industry.

Lair You: Chapter two's a historical piece on the ambiguous feelings between an emperor and one of his followers.

Penalty: In chapter three, the boss of a security firm (specializing in bodyguard services) resorts to "punishing" one of his subordinates with a kiss every time he's about to get into a fight in order to reduce the number of complaints filed against him.

7 Days: Next up is the story of another bodyguard who has seven days with a client who cannot speak during that period.

Revenge! Ring Out: Rounding up the volume is a chapter with cosplay elements.
