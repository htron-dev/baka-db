    "sinopse": "Mogami Himoto shouldn't have any problems. He's rich. He's smart. He's athletic. He's incredibly attractive. He's an \"ikemen.\"\n\nMeeting Yaenami Yukka plunges his life into chaos. First, she mistakenly accuses him of molesting her and broadcasts the news to the whole school. Then she ropes him into pretending to be his fiancee, which might not be so bad if not for the self-defense mechanism which results in her punching any ikemen who comes close to her. And then there's the curse...\n\n(Source: MU)",
