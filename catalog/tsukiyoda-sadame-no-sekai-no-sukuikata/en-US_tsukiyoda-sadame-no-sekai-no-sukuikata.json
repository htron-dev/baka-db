    "sinopse": "Tsukiyoda Sadame is a high-schooler and hypocrite who plans to use his charisma to take over the world. Through his machinations, he is able to become instantly popular as soon as he transfers into his new school, to the point where he's nominated as the class rep! However, there is another manipulator at work in his class, also trying to claim power: a girl named Kokoro.\n\nWhile following her after school (totally not stalking her, though, nothing creepy), Sadame runs into a weird old man. It seems he's been getting \"missions\" on his smartphone, and if he doesn't complete them, the world will be destroyed. Soon Sadame is recognized as a \"messiah\" as well, and he gets his first mission-- to steal Kokoro's panties. Could these missions really be from God, and how can he possibly complete them and save the world without utterly ruining his carefully designed public persona!?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
