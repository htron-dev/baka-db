    "sinopse": "The Demon Hunter Asagi was born with a mysterious inner force, but his only means of releasing it is through an ancient sword—the Moegi, a blade forged with the power of a hundred and one Demon Orbs. A search for this famed sword will lead to a promise to a young woman, one that will lead Asagi on a wearisome journey of sword fights and broken spirits to claim the magical sword and free its trapped spirits.
