## Sinopse

A pretty-boy volleyball player named Akira gets kicked out of his middle school team for being too arrogant. With his coach refusing to give him a reference, it looks like he will only be able to go to a high school with a mediocre volleyball team. By chance, he finds a leaflet for Seiryoh High School volleyball team and decided to try out. But then complications arise in the form of a delinquent with very curly hair.
