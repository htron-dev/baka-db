## Sinopse

“You were summoned but not to live on this world!!”

One day, Daichi Kou, a jack of all trades was led by a mysterious voice when he suddenly ends up reincarnated on an another world. Somehow, he began to work at the royal palace as a gardener, comfortably living with the clumsy maid Tear and the beautiful guard Kirika. And a little girl proclaiming herself as a goddess said:

“You’re the messiah that will save our world!”... !?
