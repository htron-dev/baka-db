## Sinopse

It is the Meiji era. Yui is completely bewildered by her sudden transfer to Kaede-juku, a prestigious girls' school. At that time, Yuu, the daughter of a large enterprise, appears before Yui.

Yui and Yuu's friendship immediately deepens. Although it seems as if they will spend time together peacefully, Yuu appears to have a mysterious air about her somewhere...
