## Sinopse

Candace was hired by the extremely charming businessman Nick as a nanny to look after his daughter, Jennie. Nick had just lost his wife and favored work over looking after his daughter, giving Candace a cold first impression. She tries desperately to make him acknowledge his fatherly affection, but her words go in one ear and out the other. Angered by Nick's apathetic response to his daughter, Candace lets loose a secret she hadn't meant to spill: she is Jennie's real mother!
