    "sinopse": "Izumi goes to a school that involves art and music but both sides compete against each other to win awards. Online, Izumi goes under the name Izu and creates images for music videos created by a user named Kanon who is listed as a 21-year-old female.\n\nHowever, this user has a secret! Turns out Kanon is really the new transfer student, Kaoru Sagami—the son of a famous musician. Plus, he's in love with Izumi! He wants her to fall in love with him, not his online persona, but he can't bring himself to confess that he is actually Kanon. And Izumi seems to consider him as a rival and she loves the persona more than Kaoru! What must Kaoru do to make Izumi love him!?\n\n(Source: LuffynoTomo)",
