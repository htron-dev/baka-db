## Sinopse

Rozariol, who was looking for a master to serve, meets the daughter of the Dewberry household, Snowbell, and becomes her servant. "You must not tell lies." This is the only rule that the servants must follow. However, Snowbell often tests her servants on that condition, thus the cruel "judgement" begins.
