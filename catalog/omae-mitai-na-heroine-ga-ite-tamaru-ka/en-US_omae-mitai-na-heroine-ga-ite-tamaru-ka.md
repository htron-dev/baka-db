## Sinopse

"In order to live a safe and peaceful life, become a villainess and destroy the destruction flag!"

When she was young, Tsubaki realized she had been reborn as the villainess daughter of the otome game "Love Blooms Like a Flower." Tsubaki, having grown up with a twisted personality, will surely die, while the heroine Mio and her cousin Kyousuke happily marry.

However, as Tsubaki aims to escape her fate, it seems Mio might also be a reincarnated person...?!
