Satou Matsuzaka is known for being easy to approach. Amiable and pretty, she is also better known as "New Guy Every Three Days" Satou. However, this lifestyle comes to a complete halt when she encounters the true love of her life: eight-year-old Shio Koube. Although the love they share is pure, it soon becomes endangered by a society that wants to tear them apart. Dropping her bright demeanor, Satou will stop at nothing in order to ensure that their happy life continues in peace.
