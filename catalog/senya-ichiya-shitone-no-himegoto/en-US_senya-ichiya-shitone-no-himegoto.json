    "sinopse": "Intense sex seen by chance - I, Shouta, was permitted to embrace gentle-smiled, popular bartender Aoi only at times when Aoi felt like it. Why is it that despite the deep caresses and intense invitation, he doesn't try to feel good himself? I continue to be tossed about by Aoi, who is full of riddles, but... I want to give you love that binds to the inside of your heart, not just your body. Many original drawings included!\n\n(Source: Nakama)",
