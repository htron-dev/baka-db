## Sinopse

In a world where monsters and spirits are commonplace, diviner Seimei Abeno is leading a peaceful life with his partner, Shouko. Shouko, however is a white fox, and the princess of the white fox clan no less. As their relationship mixes magical and monstrous powers with divination, a totally new kind of magical light is born. The wondrous picture scroll filled with the feel of Japanese period drama is back!
