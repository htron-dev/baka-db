    "sinopse": "Growing up in an abusive household, five-year-old twins Senri and Kazuto Nakajou found solace in each other. But they were not normal siblings—they could share pain and visions. One particular night, when Kazuto stepped in to stop their father from beating their mother, Senri is shocked when he feels nothing. Instead, he hears a different kind of commotion than normal. Investigating further, he finds to his horror that his parents have been murdered, and a vision of Kazuto being kidnapped stops him dead in his tracks. Noticing a scar on the kidnapper's arm that resembles the kanji for \"fire,\" Senri vows to hunt down this \"Fire Man.\"\n\nThirteen years later, Senri is no closer to finding the elusive Fire Man, and the visions from Kazuto have long since ceased. But just when it seems like he has no leads, he spots a man on TV with the same scar as his brother's kidnapper. However, his search for this mysterious man leaves him with more questions than answers, and Senri may find that he has more to fear than just the Fire Man.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
