## Sinopse

14 years have passed since the "White Hero's" and the "Black Demon King's" decisive conflict during the "Black and White War". The world, now lacking of a Hero, was domineered by self-proclaimed "Heroes" who were showing off their power. However, some mysterious twins turn the tables around with their wisdom and ability...!
