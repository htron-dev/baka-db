## Sinopse

Bushido Academy gathers people who are descendants of the military commanders from the Warring States Period to fight for leadership. As Shingen Takeda’s ancestor, Tetsuro Takeda is forced to join Bushido Academy. Joining him is Rieko Sanada, who is descended from Masayuki Sanada, a loyal retainer of Takeda.

Can they unify everyone together in a school where various warlord students battle for control?

The curtain rises on this magnificent picture scroll featuring a Warring States themed academy.
