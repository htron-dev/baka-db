## Sinopse

Takuto receives a headset to test out a game that is basically VR Minecraft. While playing, the game suddenly goes on maintenance and the players are unable to log out. They are to survive in the game until the maintenance is over. The thing is, six hours in the real world is half a year in the game and to make things edgy the revival system is no longer active.
