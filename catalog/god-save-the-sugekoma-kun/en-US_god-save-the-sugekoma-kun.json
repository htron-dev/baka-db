    "sinopse": "A series of short stories centering on Sugekoma, a high school prodigy with severe behavioural problems, and Miss Matsuzawa, the teacher who he ties up all the time. It's a big send-up of S/M cliches, H manga, SF, and the otaku mentality.\n\nThere are minor subplots concerning other students—e.g. Junko Fujieda, who can't stand perverts, they make her violent; and Murata, a masochist who's infatuated with her.\n\n(Source: MU)",
