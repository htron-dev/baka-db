    "sinopse": "Hayato was a warrior that had been formerly summoned to another world. He had fought magical beasts along with comrades with the same circumstances and had been returned home after 2 years. When his former started to seek revenge, what Hayato felt was not fear but delight. Because to him, it was nothing more than a chance to be transported from his boring everyday life back to the abnormal lifestyle of the other world.",
