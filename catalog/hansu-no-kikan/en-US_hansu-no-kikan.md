## Sinopse

The story begins near Berlin, Germany at the end of W.W. II. Hans, a German chief tank mechanic, and his commanding officer are racing west toward the American front lines. They hope to surrender to the US forces and escape capture by the approaching Russian Army. While traveling on foot, they discover an abandoned German Panzer IV tank near a large mansion. Hans attempts to repair the Panzer as his commanding officer heads for the mansion in search of provisions. There he discovers Rosa, a German girl; her elderly grandmother; and her dog, Gustav. Fearful for their safety, he convinces them to accompany Hans and himself on their journey West. Hans is successful in bringing the tank back to life, and they make their escape just as the Russian troops close in. More adventure and perhaps even romance will follow Hans and his companions as their story unfolds.
