    "sinopse": "If you stare at the moon too long, it will consume you.\n\nIn this haunting collection of stories, emotions sparkle bright and warm, but they also sink into cold darkness as love and hate twist together to become one. When life slips out of control, and there's a whisper in your ear telling you to give in and blame it all on the moon, what will you do? Will you comfort or crush? Maybe, just maybe, you'll do both.\n\nOn a moonlit night, not a single man in MOON CENTAUR will remain the same.\n\n(Source: DMG)",
