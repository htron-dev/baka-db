Having captured a frontier trade city, he is in charge of controlling and protecting it.

Formerly a human, now a monster, he understands the feelings of humans and the feelings of monsters as well. Thanks to that he is being considered as a great commander with both wisdom and courage by others, but in reality it is just one hardship after another:

Making the violence loving demons obey, doing something about the always complaining humans, today also he is working hard as the main leader of the demon army.
