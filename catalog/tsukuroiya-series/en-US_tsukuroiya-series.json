    "sinopse": "Within the boundary separating one world from the next, “rips” in the fabric of space will occasionally form. These tears allow the two worlds to bleed into each other, and, if left unattended, may threaten the everyday lives of the people living nearby. To find and repair these distortions, a tailor named Rem travels around the world along with his companion, a doll in the shape of a small girl. (Source: Turtle Paradise)\n\nNote: The volumes are named rather than numbered. The first volume is Awai no Mori, and the second is Madoi no Tobira.",
