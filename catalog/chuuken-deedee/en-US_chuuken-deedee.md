## Sinopse

A genius dog with IQ of 500 and smart enough not to eat poop built a dog girl robot ("Inudroid") named Deedee. He makes a young girl buy Deedee and lives together with her as Deedee's new master. Soon rival animal scientists appear, and more robots too.

Also includes another short manga "Yurebake" about a girl ghost who is not good at being scary.
