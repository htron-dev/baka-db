## Sinopse

At Tamayoshi Fine Art Research Lab—a prep school for students who want to apply for Art Schools—Haru, a student preparing to retake the entrance exam, was hit on by his roommate Natsu. Natsu is a genius painter who is good at nothing but painting. While looking after Natsu, Haru helped him out of a difficult situation. Natsu's feelings for Haru became even stronger. During exam-prep time, Haru was under a lot of stress and turned Natsu's feelings down. May Natsu's relentless and unchanging feelings reach Haru's heart no matter how many times Natsu gets rejected?
