## Sinopse

Eiko is 29 years old. Who should she be with? Where should she live? It's about time she answers these questions. Although, she should, she won't (she doesn't want to!)... "Ah, not like that," or "Not this either," Eiko is always fretting. These burdens in her daily life frame the story for "A-ko-san no Koibito."
