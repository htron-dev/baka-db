## Sinopse

A high school girl named Shin Dong San comes back from America to Korea, and she is short, fat, and ugly. She gets picked on by her fellow classmates, gets rejected from her love, and is even picked on by her childhood friend, Jeh Suh. Tired of her intolerable life, she attempts to hang herself, but fails because the rope could not handle her weight. After the fall, she discovers a box filled with medicine, and one particular bottle says that if she takes it she can become and look however she likes...
