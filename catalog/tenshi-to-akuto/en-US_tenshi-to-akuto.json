    "sinopse": "\"Standing above all and controlling the masses. That is the way of life I aspire to!\"\n\nIkurumi Akuto is the top of his class in every subject, including sports, and he knows it. The son of a well-known politician, a degree of arrogance is to be expected. But Akuto takes it to a new extreme with his condescending and self-important attitude. The friends he may have had in his elementary years have long since left his side, and it doesn't help matters that his effeminate voice makes him a target of constant ridicule by his \"lower class\" schoolmates.\n\nThen Harusaka Nari enters his life, and Akuto's controlling personality is thrown off kilter by the optimistic but manipulating young seiyuu. With his life on the line, he agrees to be a voice in her Anime Research Society's project for the upcoming Cultural Festival...as the female lead?!\n\n(Source: MU)",
