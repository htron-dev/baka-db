He only knows that the meals have to include blood, he cannot skip them and he must not tell anyone about them. However, rumours begin to spread online about vampires who live in his town of Higashi-Hachimori and paranoia begins to run high as he fears their secret might have been discovered and that his family might be in danger.",
