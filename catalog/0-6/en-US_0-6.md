## Sinopse

At first glance Moolchi is just another shy, unassuming boy whose greatest talents are running away from bullies and binging on vitamin supplements. Then one day, seemingly out of the blue, Moolchi's absentee father sends him a most unusual gift—a stunningly-proportioned "girl" who may or may not be made of flesh and blood. She calls herself "Six" and mumbles incoherently about having a prime directive. This strange and exquisite creature quickly turns the boy's life upside-down, violently disposing of junior-high hooligans and anybody else who gets in his or her way, all while wearing a getup that would make Barbarella blush. In the midst of these baffling occurrences, Moolchi just can't seem to stop worrying about his German homework. The word "oblivious" barely does him justice as Moolchi remains blissfully unaware of his father's dangerous double-life, or the cute hall monitor who harbors a crush on him, or the intentions of this mysterious femme fatale who insists on bathing with him. Meanwhile, ominous storm clouds gather on the horizon, and one lingering question looms above the others...who is this so-called "Zero" that everybody is looking for?
