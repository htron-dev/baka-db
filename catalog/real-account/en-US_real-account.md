## Sinopse

Real Account is a popular social media app that enables its users to link their account to reality. From socializing to buying things in real life, the app has become indispensable in daily life, especially for second-year high school student Ataru Kashigawa. He uses Real Account as a means to escape reality and he feels a sense of belonging and connection to his followers, whom he considers as his friends.

However, Ataru's views on friendship drastically change when he gets plunged into the virtual world of Real Account and is forced to participate in horrific death games alongside ten thousand other users. But these are far from ordinary online death games as dying in the world of Real Account means that you and all your followers die in reality. To make matters worse, having no followers also means certain death. As Aratu begins to participate in these death games, he discovers the existence of Yuuma Mukai, a teenager who looks just like him. This discovery creates a twist in events.

Betrayed by his so-called friends one by one, Ataru is left with one anonymous follower. In this virtual world where a single follower could be the difference between life or death, Ataru must survive and complete these games in order to return to the real world.
