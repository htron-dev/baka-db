There she meets Shiino Takumi, who is much cooler and more handsome than the bartender from the film. Alas! Karin believes she has found the one... until she finds out that maybe she jumped into this a bit too fast.\n\nContains extras \"Crazy Only For You\" and \"Striving Little Devil\".\n\n(Source: Wild\\*Hope)",
