## Sinopse

One day, Kengo Yagami found some of his classmates teasing a turtle that lived behind their school—and he beat them up. But when the turtle spoke, he was so shocked that he kicked it as hard as he could. Unfortunately, the turtle was actually a god, and as punishment, he switched Kengo's body with his childhood friend Mitsuka's, and their new bodies are causing both of them a lot of trouble at school...
