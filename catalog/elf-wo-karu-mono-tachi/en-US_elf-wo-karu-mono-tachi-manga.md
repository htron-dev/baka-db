## Sinopse

Airi (a talented actress), Ritsuko (a weapons fanatic), and Junpei (a martial arts expert)—find themselves stranded along with Airi's fully functional T-74 military tank. Their only hope of getting back to Japan lies with the hot-tempered Elf leader Celcia's "restoration spell." During the ritual to translate the restoration spell into modern language, transfer and imprint it onto Celcia's body, the spell breaks into fragments and is imprinted onto the skins of other elves. Airi, Ritsuko, Junpei and Celcia set off in search of the spell fragments.
