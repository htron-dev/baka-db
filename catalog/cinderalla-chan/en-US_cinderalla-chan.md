Cinderalla and her father happily run a yakitori restaurant together until he tragically dies. Luckily for Cinderalla, he returns to her as a zombie, but brings along his new zombie wife Caroline and two new stepsisters. While Cinderalla tries to adapt to her new family, she meets the charming zomibe prince and instantly falls for him. With the help of a small fairy, she turns into a zomibe herself for one night. When she trips and leaves her eyeball behind, the prince searches every zombie maiden until he finds his lost love Cinderalla.
