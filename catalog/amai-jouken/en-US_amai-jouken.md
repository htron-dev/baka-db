## Sinopse

A sexy and cool French restaurant boss, Sonobe Munekazu, suddenly appeared in front of Hisaya and took him home after saving Hisaya from his violent ex-lover. Hisaya started working in the restaurant later while staying together with boss. Love sparks flew and jealousy arose when the boss’s friend, Nagamori Kyou, appeared. Hisaya began to doubt himself and the boss. Was there a real reason for the boss to pick up a total stranger?
