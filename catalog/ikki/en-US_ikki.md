## Sinopse

After the death of his estranged father, a young man travels to a strange countryside town to take care of the funeral arrangements. With his own life in shambles, he decides to stay but finds the village people less than welcoming. Their odd behavior and the things his father left behind, leads him on a dangerous path to a truth that might be better left buried.
