    "sinopse": "Aoi is a Ravant, an artificially created human with a limited lifespan. He works as a courier who traverses long distances in impossibly short periods of time, by crossing through the Jihai (wasteland), where supposedly nothing can live. When a delivery goes awry and the recipient tries to kill him, Aoi is rescued and taken to a town with an orphanage that isn't at all what it seems. Most of the kids there have some special, super-human ability. Will the people and children of this town be allies in Aoi's search for vengance... or an even greater threat?",
