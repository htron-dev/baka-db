## Sinopse

Rikuo Nura appears to be an ordinary middle school student. Appearances, however, can be deceiving. In reality, the young boy has one-fourth of youkai blood and is the heir to a large clan of youkai led by his grandfather, Nurarihiyon. As a small child, he was told that youkai often perform evil deeds, leading to his reluctance to succeed the Nura Clan and doing whatever he could to avoid his destiny.

During the night, Rikuo undergoes a transformation into a fearsome youkai who resembles Nurarihiyon in his prime. Realizing that he can use his power to protect others, he accepts his inheritance, aiming to unite all the youkai factions across Japan and establish his own "Night Parade of a Hundred Demons."
