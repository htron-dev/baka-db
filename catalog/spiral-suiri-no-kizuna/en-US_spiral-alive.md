## Sinopse

This is a spin off story that occurs about 2-3 years before "Spiral - Suiri no Kizuna". One of the main characters is Imari, who is in love with the kid who wants to be a detective, and which also quit school running after Kiyotaka, and it seems he's dating a murderer without knowing it...? But how is it all connected to the blade children? Not long after, our favorite Blade Children from Spiral appear for the rescue, all manipulated by Kiyotaka.
