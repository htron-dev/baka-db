## Sinopse

This manga is based on a game with the same tile produced by Aqua PLUS. It is a typical dating game. The story revolves around a high school student, Kono Takaaki. He spends high school days in spring with girls, such as the childhood friends, Yusuhara Konomi and Kosaka Tamaki, and he encounters various girls of unique personalities.

The name implies it is a sequel to “To Heart”, but there is no relation between them except that the story of “To Heart 2” takes place two years later at the same school of "To Heart".
