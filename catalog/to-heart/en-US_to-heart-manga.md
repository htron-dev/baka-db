## Sinopse

Akari is a cute but somewhat inhibited teenage girl who attends high school with her childhood chums, Hiroyuki and Masashi. Though she regards these two along the lines of siblings, Akari finds her world becoming troublesome as her adolescent affection for the generous and warm-hearted Hiroyuki begins to grow onto something more. The complications only thicken when a beautiful senior, Serika Kurusugawa, steps into the picture. Akari finds her solution in an unlikely place: An android named Multi, who happens to be training to become a full fledged maid robot, just might be able to use her machined mind to help Akari overcome her shyness and win Hiroyuki's love!
