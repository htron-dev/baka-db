    "sinopse": "The prince, who had a fiancée, was waiting upon a lady that wasn't me. Then that means he's breaking it off?\n\n\"Finally!\" With this, I'm delighted that I can finally escape from that strict princess training. As I gave the both of them my thanks, I went back to the countryside. But for some reason, the prince ran after me. He won't break it off? Why?!\n\nThis is a highly exciting love comedy of a prince who chases after a lady that runs away.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
