When he comes to, he's on a bed full of ￥ 10,000 bills and a half naked man?! After waking up, the man even says \"I'll give you the money.\" Confused, Yuuki escapes and goes home, but he re-encounters the mysterious man, Nao. \"I'll give you the money, so let's have sex. Think of it as physical labor,\" Nao says, but what does Yuuki do...?\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Endless World",
