## Sinopse

Everything Judy touches is put to sleep. Even though she can't even have a lover because of this curse, she is to marry the ill-rumored "Magician of the Staircase"! However, the goal of the magician—whom she thought came to pick her up—was just a sample of Judy's blood. He rejected Judy with... "Marriage? Me? Don't be silly. It's quite enough to be single for this entire life."?! This is a love fairy tale between a young girl and a frustrating and socially awkward evil magician!
