    "sinopse": "Satoru, Hikari, and Ogami are three sisters whose dad is a Buddhist priest. They all have different views on living in a temple. Satoru, the oldest, doesn't really mind, but she wants to be a doctor, so her focus is medical school. Ogami, the youngest, hates it and goes to a school far away so that none of her classmates will know about her family. Hikari, the middle sister, loves it, and since both her sisters are uninterested in taking over from their dad, she is the de facto heir.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: MMK Girl",
