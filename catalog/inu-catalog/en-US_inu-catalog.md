## Sinopse

The school public-health doctor, Ren, is often called a "small pet" by the students. Then one day he was shocked dead when he bumped into two students who were about to do some kind of "impure" association in the school's backyard! Not to mention, one of those two was the charismatic model Midori whom Ren had always been longing for. Ren was even more shocked when Midori made him grab his "certain something" then came right in Ren's hands. After that, when Midori confessed that he liked him, Ren felt so pissed-off thinking that Midori took the word "like" too lightly, he punched Midori with his own fits. Midori was so moved by that hit that the following day he began to seduce Ren happily and relentlessly... Sweet lovemelody between the indulged beautiful model and the tough public-health doctor.
