## Sinopse

Ryouma is always ready to defend the weak and fight for honor, but that doesn't help you get the girl. Caught in the middle of a fight between gods, Ryouma was found worthy and become one with the Warrior King of the Southern Skies. Now NOTHING makes sense, as he has to juggle his high school studies and epic battles that shake Heaven and Earth. (Source: Media Blasters)
