    "sinopse": "For his coming-of-age ceremony, our 20-year-old protagonist goes to the tailor frequented by his father to make his first suit. His disdain of suits is changed by what this first class tailor tells him: \"Usually, when women dress up, they'd have to reveal some skin to appear sexy. But for men, it is the opposite. Suits increase the allure of men by acting as a packaging that contains desire.\"\n\nHe accidentally finds out that the tailor has a crush on his father. From then on, he is further intrigued by the older tailor. He gradually discovers that the 38-year-old is changing him in more ways than one.\n\n(from M-U)",
