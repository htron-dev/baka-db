    "sinopse": "The wild west of the United States in the late 1800s was a dangerous, near-lawless place. It was an era where force defined the rules, and men were known for the speed and accuracy of their gun arms. After aiding an impressive arrest in Ellsworth, Kansas, gunman Wyatt Earp is recruited to help defend justice in Dodge City, Kansas alongside Bat Masterson. On the way to Dodge City, Wyatt meets a lovely young singer, Dora, who seems to be in danger. Will Wyatt be up to the difficult task of defending the law in Dodge City?",
