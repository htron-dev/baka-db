## Sinopse

Nanako, an up and coming model, falls in love with another model named Etsushi...who, alas, turns out to be gay. Meanwhile, Nanako also discovers that another young actor is deeply in love with her and she is unable to choose between him and Etsushi. Her indecision leads her to a state of depression until the two men come together to encourage her and help her make decisions about her future.
