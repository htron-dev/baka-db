But what was waiting for him in the classroom was Himeno like he had never seen her before! Before they knew it, Akira and his classmates were trapped inside the school, unable to escape. Who was doing this, and why? Mysterious forces close in on the 11 fearful children, as if to laugh at them. This is the story of a harsh fate that awaits them.
