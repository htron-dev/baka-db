There he encountered researcher, Yasoshima Shiro, who reminded Hinari of his first love, a gentle police captain. Immediately smitten at first sight, Yasoshima lured Hinari with a DNA lecture and preyed on the still innocent Hinari! As much as Hinari hated to admit it, he wasnâ€™t entirely unaffected by Yasoshima. Will Hinari be able to resist the quirky scientist!? A delicate yet comical love story! (Source: B-U)",
