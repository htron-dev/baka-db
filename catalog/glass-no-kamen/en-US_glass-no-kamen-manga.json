    "sinopse": "Maya Kitajima is a good-for-nothing girl with a passion and talent for acting. After watching a play only once, Maya can immediately perfectly imitate the performance word-by-word. This talent leads her to one day be discovered by Chigusa Tsukikage, a once-famous actress who performed and owned the rights to the play called \"The Crimson Goddess.\"\n\nConsidered to be a legendary play, The Crimson Goddess attracts the attention of many, including Masumi Hayami, a wealthy businessman who is also a secret admirer of Maya. Another one interested in the play is Maya's rival, Ayumi Himekawa, a gifted individual whose veteran parents trained her in acting since childhood.\n\nGlass no Kamen follows Maya and Ayumi as they climb their way through the relentless world of entertainment, overcoming intense training and challenges to become actresses worthy of playing the role of The Crimson Goddess.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
