    "sinopse": "This series of essays, presented in manga format, chronicles the author's experiences with the many cats she has lived with over the years. Presenting herself as a giant raccoon, Sakuma humorously reveals all of the quirks and small cutenesses of her pets.\n\nFor the curious, this manga is not related to the cat-in-a-bowl \"Neko Nabe\" phenomenon on Nico Nico Douga, or to the blog and photography book associated with it.",
