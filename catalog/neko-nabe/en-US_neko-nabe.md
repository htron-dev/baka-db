## Sinopse

This series of essays, presented in manga format, chronicles the author's experiences with the many cats she has lived with over the years. Presenting herself as a giant raccoon, Sakuma humorously reveals all of the quirks and small cutenesses of her pets.

For the curious, this manga is not related to the cat-in-a-bowl "Neko Nabe" phenomenon on Nico Nico Douga, or to the blog and photography book associated with it.
