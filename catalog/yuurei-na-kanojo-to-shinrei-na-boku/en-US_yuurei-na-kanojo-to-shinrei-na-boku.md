## Sinopse

Cameraman Genji is someone who loves ghosts and the supernatural but he can't see nor feel them! He wants to someday capture them on camera, so he moves into a place that might be haunted. He gets lucky, there is a female ghost around his age who had died in his new place. Ever since he was able to get a photo of himself and the ghost, he now wants to get to know her as a potential girlfriend! But is this ghost enthusiast too much for her to handle!?
