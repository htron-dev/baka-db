## Sinopse

It was simply blackmail.

Logan Miller was so determined that Talia Roberts come work for him that he was quite prepared to tell lies and blacken her name with her boss, John Diamond.

And John might well have believed Logan because he knew how ambitious Talia was. With little choice, she agreed to set up a catering service in Logan's new Brazilian office.

She was shocked when she discovered she'd also be sharing Logan's apartment. Worse still, she could really see no way out....
