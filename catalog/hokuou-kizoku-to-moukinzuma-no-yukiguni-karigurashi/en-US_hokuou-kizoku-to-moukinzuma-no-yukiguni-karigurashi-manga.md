## Sinopse

Most would call the Levantret territory a frozen wasteland. The sun does not shine for half of the year, and even when it does, the inhabitants must still endure the frigid cold. Even so, what Levantret does have is a boundless sky, spanned by the ethereal Northern Lights.

The local lord, Ritzhardt "Ritz" Salonen Levantret, loves his homeland more than anyone else. He is in search of a wife, but few women are willing to give up their lives of luxury and move out to the boonies. High society calls him the "Yeti of the Borderlands" and looks down on his simple lifestyle. At a dinner party, Ritz is enraptured by the decorated lady-knight Sieglinde "Sieg" von Wettin and immediately asks to marry her. To the surprise of most, she accepts a "trial marriage" of one year.

For Sieg, this is a chance to discover what it means to be a "wife" after spending the majority of her life in the military. On the other hand, Ritz wants to show her everything his beloved home has to offer. In the wintry Levantret, from hunting in the blistering cold to handicrafts around the cozy hearth, every day is filled with new and warm memories.
