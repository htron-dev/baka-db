    "sinopse": "Perverts are people who know the shape of their desires. They have carefully traced those contours like a blind man using both hands to measure the shape of a vase. Colette works in a brothel in early 20th century Paris, an occupation she can't escape. She and the other girls support each other, satisfying the desires of their clients, day in, day out. The one source of hope in her difficult life was her trysts with Leon. But Colette could never be sure if Leon really loved her... The strength of women in their pleasurable confines; the naked desires of the 'amorous gentlemen.' Welcome to a beautiful, bewitching bordello of love and desire...\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
