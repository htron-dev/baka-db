## Sinopse

Ichiko idolizes Arashi-sempai from afar, ever since she saw him play in his band a year ago. When she accidentally damages his right hand, she vows to become his right hand and do everything he needs. Will this be the chance she's always wanted to get close to him or will it prove to be more than she can handle? (taken from BakaUpdates)
