    "sinopse": "When they were young, Suzu and Midori were separated as Midori moved away. Suzu grew up and has become a builder of robots and anything else mechanical she can get her hands on. One fateful morning her favorite electronics shop is closed so she goes off to relax while waiting for the shop to open when Midori calls again, after all these years, wanting to take up where they left off. Suzu is ecstatic about this—they had so much in common when they were young…\n\nOnly Midori has opened up a Maid Café…\n\n(Source: Animeraider)",
