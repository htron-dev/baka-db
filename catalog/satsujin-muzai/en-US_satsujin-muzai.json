    "sinopse": "The manga centers on a female lawyer who is the second-youngest bar passer at 20 years old, and who has remained undefeated in all her cases, with each one resulting in a not-guilty verdict, even for those charged with murder. As a result, she remains an outsider in the legal community despite her victories.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
