## Sinopse

Miyo "Muge" Sasaki, a peculiar second-year junior high student who has fallen in love with her classmate Kento Hinode. She resolutely pursues Hinode every day, but he takes no notice of her. Nevertheless, while carrying a secret she can tell no one, Muge continues to pursue Hinode. Muge discovers a magic mask that allows her to transform into a cat named Tarō. The magic lets Muge get close to Hinode, but eventually it may also make her unable to transform back to a human.
