## Sinopse

I was picked up by a beautiful but shy and useless vampire? Joel, an orphaned boy wandering the forest alone, collapsed and was picked up by the vampire Adelia. Adelia is a beauty, but she is shy with others and her daily life is completely dysfunctional. So who is taking care of whom?

The clumsy communal life of these two awkward lonely people begins.
