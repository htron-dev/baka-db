## Sinopse

Claire Thorpe was enjoying a peaceful London life until one day, on a business trip to the Middle East, she unexpectedly bumped into her estranged husband, Nick. Nick, a star journalist at a British TV station, devotes his life to covering stories in the world's most dangerous hot spots. Claire left him when she could no longer stand the stress of always waiting for him to return home safely, and it's now just one more year until she can file for divorce. But here they are, reunited in the most unexpected place—she can't believe it... And despite Claire's efforts to avoid him and keep her life on track, Nick won't stop reminding her that she's still his wife and pressuring her to come back to him. She thinks she knows what's best for her, but her traitorous body has other ideas!
