## Sinopse

“Would you like me to buy your country…?” The one who proposed this to Eleanor, a princess from a small, financially troubled country, was Maximilian, an astronomically rich industrialist and her first love. In exchange for his support, Maximilian now gets to show off the princess by his side while, though Eleanor may doubt his intentions, rekindling their love…! Besides “The London Game ~Love for the Princess~” the book also contains “Flames of Love at the Aegean Sea,” a story of a billionaire’s dangerous love and revenge.
