## Sinopse

At opposite ends of a certain super-huge site lay two separate dormitory schools; the liberal Aoimiya School and the disciplined Kaburaya School.

These two schools have been rivals for generations, fated to scramble for control over the site in a never ending "Jintori Game"
Teams of students work and fight together, and if a team loses all three members it's considered their school's loss.

When Aoimiya's new "Princess" disappears, suspicion falls on Kaburaya.
To find out what happened three Aoimiya students form a team to launch their own investigation; Akira - who will stick his nose into anything, Kaiki - who thinks the forest is full of ghosts, and Shinobu - the son of a man of power.

The school itself could be forfeit if they fail.

A high-tension school battle full of swirling intrigue begins!
