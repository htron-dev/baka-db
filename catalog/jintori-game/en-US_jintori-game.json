    "sinopse": "At opposite ends of a certain super-huge site lay two separate dormitory schools; the liberal Aoimiya School and the disciplined Kaburaya School.\n\nThese two schools have been rivals for generations, fated to scramble for control over the site in a never ending \"Jintori Game\"\nTeams of students work and fight together, and if a team loses all three members it's considered their school's loss.\n\nWhen Aoimiya's new \"Princess\" disappears, suspicion falls on Kaburaya.\nTo find out what happened three Aoimiya students form a team to launch their own investigation; Akira - who will stick his nose into anything, Kaiki - who thinks the forest is full of ghosts, and Shinobu - the son of a man of power.\n\nThe school itself could be forfeit if they fail.\n\nA high-tension school battle full of swirling intrigue begins!",
