## Sinopse

Kokoro is a high school girl who is older than everybody else in her class. That's because she was blind until she recently had an operation that gave her new eyes. Kunimi is in her class, but is an outcast because of the rumors about his psychic powers. For some reason, these two are drawn to each other.
