This is a collection of three short stories associated with mangaka Takashina Ryouko. The first story, written by author Edogawa Ranpo, is illustrated by Takashina-sensei, while the latter two are both written and illustrated by Takashina-sensei.

Doctor G no Shima:
Sayoko is in love with her older sister's boyfriend, Shunichi, but it seems her tutor Moroto-san has also taken an interest in her. Caught in between these two, Sayoko is thrown into a world of murder, mystery, and horror. What happened in both Shunichi and Moroto-san's past that is now threatening Sayoko's life?

Datenshi:
Is an eerily beautiful, handsomely-crafted doll with a mysterious past responsible for the evil that befalls its owners? Does the doll really whisper satanic murmurs?

Shiroi Senritsu:
A girl wakes up in a hospital with no memories. Her fiance tells her her name is Titi, and that she is the heiress of a very wealthy estate, but why is it taking her forever to feel comfortable back at her own home?
