    "sinopse": "The person who gave birth to you should have a story for the life they have lived so far. In history class, I learned the stories of a lot of strangers, but somehow I don't know anything about my mother's history.\n\nSomeday, I'm sure I'll regret that. Which is why, before that day comes, I want to find out about something. A human comedy about \"me\" and \"mother\" that may change you a little.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
