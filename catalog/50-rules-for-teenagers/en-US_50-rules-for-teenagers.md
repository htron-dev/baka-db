## Sinopse

The desire for a normal teenage life haunts the overworked and underappreciated Mi-Roo. While most girls her age are carefree and boy-crazy, she is bound to the grueling gigs of student, homemaker and full-time babysitter to her siblings.

With a mother who's mostly missing-in-action and a twin brother who's best at doing nothing, Mi-Roo is trapped in a constant balancing act of housework and homework, leaving her zero time for romance and boys. But she's no superhero - it's going to take more than a little determination to stay in control of this whirlwind!
