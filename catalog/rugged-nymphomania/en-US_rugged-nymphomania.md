## Sinopse

Shintaro Kago collection

A Certain Hero's Death:
Imagine, that the roles of whales and humans were swapped. So whales (or whale-like creatures) would be rather small, able to talk and smart. Humans would be large, stupid and hunted by whale-people. Then shake this all in the slightly insane head of Shintaro Kago ad you get this peculiar one-shot.
