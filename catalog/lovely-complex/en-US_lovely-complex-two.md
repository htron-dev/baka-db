## Sinopse

The original romantic comedy followed two close, but bickering, high school friends with height complexes: a tall girl named Risa Koizumi and a short boy named Atsushi Ohtani. The advertising blurb for Love★Com D promises that "the family of Love★Com will return," but hints that Risa and Atsushi will not be main leads this time.
