    "sinopse": "In her young life, Rika Furude has witnessed unspeakable tragedy in her hometown of Hinamizawa; she has repeated the month of June in 1983 over and over again, each time ending in disaster. But in each world, the variables leading to tragedy are always different. As the summer resets again, Rika finds herself back in June of 1983 with even less time than usual to set things right.\n\nMinagoroshi-hen follows Rika's journey into yet another world, as she tries to fight against her own impending doom as well as that of her friends. However, as she and her friends solve one problem, another pops up in its place, as they inch ever closer towards the true identity of the mastermind behind the countless tragedies in Hinamizawa.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
