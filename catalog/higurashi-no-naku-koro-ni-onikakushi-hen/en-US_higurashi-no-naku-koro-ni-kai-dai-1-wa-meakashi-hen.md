## Sinopse

Meakashi-hen is the answer arc corresponding to Watanagashi-hen. Meakashi-hen consists of events very similar to those of Watanagashi-hen told from the perspective of Shion Sonozaki, with only a few minor variations. In this chapter, the audience sees the true reason for the criminal's murderous actions in Watanagashi-hen—a lost love. Satoshi Houjou is first physically met in this arc, unlike the others where he is only mentioned. The first hints of that which ties together the arcs are given.
