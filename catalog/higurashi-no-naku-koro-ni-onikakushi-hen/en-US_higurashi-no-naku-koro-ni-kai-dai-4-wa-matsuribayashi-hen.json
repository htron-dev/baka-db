The last step for the characters to take is putting the pieces together in order to defeat the culprit, obtain the miracle, and break through the barrier of June 1983. Matsuribayashi-hen is a \"Good End\" in which no major deaths occur in that June, although the deaths in previous years still occurred.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
