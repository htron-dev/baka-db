    "sinopse": "Tsumiboroshi-hen is the answer arc corresponding to Onikakushi-hen. Unlike Meakashi-hen, Tsumihoroboshi-hen's story is drastically different from the plot of its question arc. In Tsumihoroboshi-hen, Rena experiences a situation similar to Keiichi's in Onikakushi-hen, as she makes a terrible mistake and becomes distrustful of her former friends. It is the first chapter with a (seemingly) happy ending, although the Tips reveal a sinister twist.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
