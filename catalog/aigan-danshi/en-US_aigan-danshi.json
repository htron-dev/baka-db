    "sinopse": "Being the new matron in a male dorm full of rich boys isn't turning out easy for Hina. There's the boy who acts like an excited puppy and the playful twins to start, and it's been one hell of a ride from day one. The worst is the dorm leader, Akira. He's mesmerizingly hot, but keeps butting heads with Hina. He gets on her nerves, and yet she can't help but notice him. As if this isn't enough, one of the boys decides to wake her up one night with a naughty surprise... Can Hina survive this wild dorm life?\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
