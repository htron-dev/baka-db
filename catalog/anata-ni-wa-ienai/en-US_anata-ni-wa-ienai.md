## Sinopse

When Isabella was younger, she followed Paulo around as if he were her brother. He's ten years older and has always been a prince in Isabella’s eyes, but he works for a large bank in London now and only returns to Brazil once a year. One day, Isabella overheard him talking about his plans for marriage. She was so upset that she ran off and had a one-night stand with her professor, and now...she's pregnant! But how can she tell Paulo that? She runs into him while she's studying abroad in London, and he invites her to come and live with him until the baby is born. Isabella is carrying another man's child, but she can't stop her feelings for Paulo! What is she to do?
