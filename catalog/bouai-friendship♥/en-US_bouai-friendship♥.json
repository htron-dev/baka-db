The people who do notice him even call him \"Ghosty.\" One day, he becomes friends with one of the most popular kids in school, Kyoya. But, Kyoya's idea of friendship isn't exactly what Yuzuru expected.... While Yuzuru struggles with this new-found \"friendship,\" he realizes that behind all his popularity, Kyoya feels alone, too. The two opposites are soon drawn to each other as they see that they actually do have some things in common.... A cute high school love story between the popular kid and a \"ghost.\"\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
