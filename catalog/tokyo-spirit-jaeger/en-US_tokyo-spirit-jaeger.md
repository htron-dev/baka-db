## Sinopse

Some decades ago, monsters appeared from another world. A high schooler living in Tokyo, Kuzumi Daigo received a mysterious message through the game application Social Spirit Jeager, and, as a result, went to Mitaka Station. There, what he saw was an enraged goblin, and the form of Takayashiki Runa who had just defeated said goblin.

Using fairy magic and our weapons, let's suppress those otherworldly monsters!
