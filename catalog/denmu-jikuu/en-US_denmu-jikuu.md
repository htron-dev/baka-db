## Sinopse

A decaying, old satellite is headed straight for Tokyo, and the city is three citizens shy of total evacuation. Hard-boiled detective Watanabe remains in the abandoned gotham, searching for a gaunt, desperate Machida, who is wanted for attempted murder; and Chiaki, a stubborn housewife who doesn't believe the burning rubble will hit Tokyo, also remains behind. But Chiaki is wrong. And when the satellite does hit, the three find the city is less abandoned than before. Someone was riding that satellite down from orbit, and that someone wasn't born on earth!
