## Sinopse

Lipton joins the Second Kukulcan Corps. He longs to ride the Kukulcan in the sky with his fellow Kukulcan airmen, while unifying with these other soldiers in slightly lecherous behavior during this youthful story. And while the Kukulcan Corps are an all-male society, Lipton learns that the soldier he bunks with, Tsubasa Chino, is actually a woman? This flying fantasy love comedy could actually become a romance manga!
