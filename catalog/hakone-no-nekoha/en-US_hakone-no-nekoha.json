    "sinopse": "He's slow on his legs. Hopelessly slow. But still, while watching the \"Ekiden,\" a two-day race in Hakone, Nekoya Taichi was deeply inspired by it.\n\nNekoya practices every day, but it seems like he isn't improving much at all. His senpai and big inspiration, Hayama Naoki, sees his effort and wants to believe in him. Getting accepted into the same high school Hayama went to, means to pass a harsh test and even though it seems like he has no talent for running at all, Nekoya continues his practice and doesn't give up on his big dream: running at the Hakone Ekiden—together with Hayama.",
