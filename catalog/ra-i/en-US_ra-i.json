    "sinopse": "Al Foster is a private detective whose workaday life suddenly shakes up with the arrival of 13-year-old Rai Spencer, youngest son of the billionaire Spencer family, genius child prodigy, and unrepentant smart aleck. Rai has an unusual gift -- his telekinetic powers can knock out anyone who stands in his path. He also has a sister who sports a mean left hook. But what Rai desperately needs is someone to figure out who has been trying to kill him for the past month! (Source: Tokyopop)",
