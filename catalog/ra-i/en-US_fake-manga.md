## Sinopse

Sanami Matoh's FAKE, a shounen-ai favorite, is the unlikely love story between two NYC copsâ€”who both happen to be guys...

Meet Ryou and Dee, two New York City cops with an attraction for action, and for each other! When Ryou, a soft spoken officer, joins the NYPD's 27th precinct, he's soon partnered up with Dee's a cocky, confident cop with attitude to spare.
