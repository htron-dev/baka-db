    "sinopse": "Fujishima Takara goes to high school and will start living in a dorm because he has lost all his family except for his father, who's always away for his work. Takara has to share a room with Kosaka Kyomine. Living together isn't easy, and many rows ensue. Kyomine is very introverted, while Takara is just the opposite. At first the two get on each other's nerves because of those differences, but things eventually start to turn towards friendship.\n\n(Source: MU)",
