## Sinopse

When Hozumi returns to the island he grew up on, he is hoping to speak to Mishima, his close friend and love from high school. Hozumi lied to Mishima about his feelings in high school, breaking his heart, and they haven't spoken since. Hozumi discovers that Mishima has become a hermit, living isolated in the lighthouse his grandfather tended to. But Hozumi is determined to speak with Mishima one more time.
