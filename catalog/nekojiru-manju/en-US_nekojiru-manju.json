But the tale quickly turns into a nightmare when the true nature of these evil creatures is revealed. With an unique sense of cynicism and wickedness, Nekojiru creates an inherently cruel and absurd universe where the two kittens transform their environment into a huge playground.\n\n(Source: MU)",
