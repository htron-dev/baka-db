    "sinopse": "Kentarou Ueno is a mangaka. He lives with his wife and their 10-year-old daughter in a small house that is also his studio. They are a happy family. Even though his wife suffers from depression, she is following the treatment, and all seems fine. One day, he found her on the floor, faced down and inert. Sayonara mo Iwazu ni is the story of what happened after that in Kentarou's life.\n\n(Source: Kana, translated)",
