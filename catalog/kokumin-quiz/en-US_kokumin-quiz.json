    "sinopse": "In a different world than the one we live in, a world where Japan is the lone superpower of the world, there is a wildly popular game show called the National Quiz. Every night, people dreaming of riches, fame, vengeance and happiness compete on the show, for the chance to be granted a wish, any wish they have: the National Quiz has the power to make your wildest dreams come true. It also has the ability, if you lose, to make your life a living hell.\n\nThis is the story of K-i K-ichi (aka prisoner KK47331), a former actor-turned losing National Quiz contestant-turned wildly popular host of the show, and the people and events surrounding him.\n\n(Source: Mangascreener)",
