    "sinopse": "Hibiya is born Beta and works as a researcher. One day a new researcher came, claiming that he is a Beta and that he came to the company because he respects him.\n\nWhile the researchers were preforming experiments with some animals, Hibiya was accidentally stung by a bee and caused hypersensitivity as he is allergic to bee stings, and he had been stung once when he was small.\n\n(Source: My Reading Manga)",
