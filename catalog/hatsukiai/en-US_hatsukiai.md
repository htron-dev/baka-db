## Sinopse

A collection of short stories about first romantic relationships. When young people first start dating, there's a lot of shyness, miscommunication, and embarrassment involved. How do you figure out the perfect time to grab a girl's hand while walking together? When is the right time to share your first kiss? These brief stories capture the innocent awkwardness and the excitement of falling in love.
