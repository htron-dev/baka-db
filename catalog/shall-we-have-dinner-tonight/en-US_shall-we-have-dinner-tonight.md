## Sinopse

Do-hee Woo and Hae-Gyung Kim are both young and single, each with a history of broken relationships in their past. They meet one day while trying to dine alone at the same restaurant and they soon become friends who eat together every week. But with each meal, their friendship grows deeper as they help each other heal from the heartbreak they have suffered and soon they must redefine what they mean to each other.
