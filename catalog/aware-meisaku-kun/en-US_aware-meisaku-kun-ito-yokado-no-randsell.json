    "sinopse": "A collaboration between Aware! Meisaku-kun and the general merchandise store company Ito-Yokado. It promotes the latter's randsell selection by starting the episode with the principal yelling at the kids as to why they're coming to school without backpacks. The web-commercial was posted to Aware! Meisaku-kun's official YouTube channel for a limited time and could be watched at the TV screens near the cash registers at each Ito-Yokado store a few days after.",
