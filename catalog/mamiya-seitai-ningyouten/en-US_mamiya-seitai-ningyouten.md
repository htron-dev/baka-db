Mamiya is a shop owner of the oh-so popular "Love Doll House Mamiya", a place where you can request a special order doll. Whatever your dream doll is they will successfully make and provide for you. These 'dolls' are very human like, if not told you would not even know if someone is one, like Hanako for example. She is the shop's assistant, a doll with her own mind and personality.
