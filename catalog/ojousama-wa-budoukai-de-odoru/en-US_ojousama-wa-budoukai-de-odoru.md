## Sinopse

Kuryuuin Getsuka loves martial arts and she won a championship in middle school but her father forcibly stopped Getsuka from doing martial arts. She was brought back to a high class all-girls academy that she went to when she was in elementary school and it was where there isn't any martial arts club, so she started her own martial arts association.
