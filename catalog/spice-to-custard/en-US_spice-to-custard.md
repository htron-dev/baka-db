## Sinopse

Satonaka Tamami (Tama) has been in love with her childhood friend Tsukimori Masachika (Chika) for 10 years now. Tama first confessed to Chika when she was just six but got turned down. Chika told her that he might consider if they were in high school!

10 years worth of wait is now over and Tama declares to her friends that she is going to confess to Chika. But her friends are worried since Chika is kind of cold and he is in the kendo club that forbids its members from any relationship.

Tama still musters enough courage and asks Chika out. Chika turns her down on the spot. However, seeing how he almost broke his childhood friend's heart, he decides to give her a chance to go out with him but only if she can keep their relationship a secret! Tama is in ecstasy and really looking forward to their relationship but, keeping their relationship a secret might not be as simple as she had thought.
