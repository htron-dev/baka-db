## Sinopse

While visiting the Seifa Utaki, the foremost sacred grove of Okinawa, the young woman Miwako is drawn into a cave and called into her power while the earth quakes beneath her. Miwako, who was born on Kudaka Island, the "Island of the Gods," is apparently a living embodiment of the ancient shaman-queen. What destiny awaits the newly awakened Miwako?
