## Sinopse

The naval port of Azur Lane is as lively as it can get—just some of the people present include the upbeat and cheerful Javelin, the laid-back and easygoing Laffey, the quiet and calm Ayanami, and the earnest and determined Z23. Living out their lives to the fullest, these girls get into various shenanigans—slowly but surely!
