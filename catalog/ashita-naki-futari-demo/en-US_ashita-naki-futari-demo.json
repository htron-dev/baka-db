    "sinopse": "Zoe, the daughter of millionaire Oscar Balfour, has always lived a life of luxury. But when she discovers that Oscar is not her biological father, her world collapses. Zoe, who has built her entire identity around being a Balfour, tries to forget by going out to parties night after night. One day at a gallery opening, she meets Max, a dark and gloomy man who stands out among the joyful crowd. They spend a dreamlike night together, but then he coldly dismisses her. In this story of love and resurrection, can these two mend their broken hearts?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
