## Sinopse

"The sun always sets in the west."

Handsome Nishino Taiyou is an architecture student, but he can't finish designing his house. In the shadow of the smile of the cheerful but poor Nanno, the room they share is slowly filling with love. Before long, old wounds from the past seem to be keeping these two from touching each other…?
