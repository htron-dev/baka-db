## Sinopse

Tenki Yohou no Koibito, The Weatherman is My Lover, is a story about the straight-laced newscaster, Keitarou Koganui, and his eccentric cosplay weatherman, Amasawa Chitose. The story progresses following this complementing Anchor Man and weather fairy duo as their shows ratings rise higher and higher with some delicious sparks of love tossed in their daily news reports. Will these two TV stars end up together or will Amasawa's dark past block the path of their happiness together?

This series is on hiatus.
