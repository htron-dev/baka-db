## Sinopse

Fruits is a traditional shoujo manga which touches on the time-tested issues of friendship, love, betrayal and happiness: traits all of us are well familiar with. Written by Korean mangaka Kim Euy-Jung, the comic attempts to explore the warming issues of the heart which people of all ages get in touch with, regardless of age; the comic refers to characters as young as children to elderly folks. The stories are all standalone stories which are intertwined in the same environment, so readers will have fun trying to make sense of how their lives relate to each other in their individual pursuits.
