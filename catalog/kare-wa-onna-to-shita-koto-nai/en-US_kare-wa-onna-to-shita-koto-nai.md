## Sinopse

Akiko Misono is 32, dateless for eight years, and is getting desperate, so she decided to go to the marriage interview set up by her aunt.

It turns out it was with an old classmate from middle school, Takanobu Ichihara, who's handsome and has a good job now. After the interview, Akiko was sure she's been rejected, but Takanobu later invites her on a date.

However, at the end of the date, he reveals the big secret that he has never slept with a woman, and thus begins the journey where both characters confront and overcome their insecurities.
