    "sinopse": "Bath Towel is a quirky story about Izutsuya Anju, a self-proclaimed hedonist, and his friend/co-conspirator cameraman Monono Kejime. Together, they prostitute themselves and blackmail their way through the high school they still attend after failing to graduate three times. The latest victim is Koizumi Yuuji, younger brother of Jouji who has been in love with the mixed race Anju since elementary school. Both brothers become obsessed with the beautiful Anju, who will give his heart to no one because no man or woman can surpass Kaoru, the owner of his heart and apparently Anju’s ex-boyfriend. Despite this, he still gives his bodies to the brothers and looks on them as friends. Things really heat up when Anju’s apartment burns down, giving him only enough time to save a precious bath towel that belonged to his mother. But as Kaoru suddenly comes to town, a surprising truths is revealed that shocks everyone. Who is this mysterious Kaoru that Anju keeps talking about and why is the family resemblance to Anju so striking? (Source: Fushichou)",
