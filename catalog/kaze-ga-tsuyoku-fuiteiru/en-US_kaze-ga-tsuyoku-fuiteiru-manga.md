## Sinopse

Only the fastest and most budding runners from different universities can participate in the most prestigious marathon relay race in Japan—the Hakone Ekiden. Now in his last year of college, the enthusiastic Haiji Kiyose has yet to realize his dream of becoming an athlete worthy of the event. To get himself closer to achieving his ambition, he must assemble nine other men in his run-down dormitory, Chikusei-sou, who will race alongside him.

Meanwhile, first-year student Kakeru Kurahara is supposed to have a quiet, reserved life. However, after recklessly handling his rental payment, he finds himself at a rough start, sprinting away with stolen convenience store food. Soon, he runs across Haiji, who immediately recognizes the young man—a former runner ill-famed for his history. As they stop their cat-and-mouse chase, Haiji offers him to stay in Chikusei-sou, and Kakeru accepts it halfheartedly.

At the apartment awaits students of different origins and characters. The addition of Kakeru to the place enables Haiji to execute his next step. However, of all the residents, only Kakeru currently knows about Haiji's eccentric plan! When Haiji finally unveils his fervent goal, can the rest of the team commit to his wishes?
