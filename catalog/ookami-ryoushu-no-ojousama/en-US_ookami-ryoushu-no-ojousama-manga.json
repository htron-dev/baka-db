    "sinopse": "Fifteen years ago, the land was saved through the dedication of the revolutionaries and the young Kaid, who valiantly infiltrated the tyrannical ruler's household under the alias \"Helt.\" Memories remain fresh, and even now, the enmity against the former rulers has not faded.\n\nThese feelings of resentment are a cross that 15-year-old orphan Shirley Hince must bear. In her previous life, she was the ignorant daughter of that household and lover of her servant Helt. Even if she did not actively take part in their tyranny, she feels that this rebirth is her chance to atone for her sins. So, she resolves to dedicate her entire life and meager abilities to a church as a nun.\n\nBefore she can, however, she is sent to work as a maid for Lord Kaid Falloa, the current ruler. Face to face with her former lover, old memories and painful feelings resurface. In time, Shirley must confront both the sins of her past and the love that never quite faded in her heart.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
