## Sinopse

They say that the War God Set is a brute, unfit in his position of power. The only one able to rein him in is his peace-loving older brother, King Osiris. However, when an unknown party assassinates Osiris right in front of Set, all blame falls onto the War God's shoulders, and the public condemns him for a crime he did not commit.

At his execution, Set's head rests upon a chopping block. However, in a blink, he awakens in the past, years before his brother's murder. Even his sister, Nephthys, is alive, despite having been killed by a group of thugs years prior. Back to when it all started, the one who orchestrated it all begins to make their move. But this time, Set will not be ignorant. With his fury ignited, the War God is hellbent on revenge for his unrightful execution—but even more so for the death of his beloved brother.
