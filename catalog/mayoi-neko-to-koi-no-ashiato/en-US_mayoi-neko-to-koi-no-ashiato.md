## Sinopse

After 7 years, Kokoro Miyane returned to his previous city because of his parents' transfer. Back to the same school too, he can't wait to see Chanko (the stray cat that lives there) again, even if it's past curfew, but his attempt to find Chanko fails when he ends up getting caught by the school nurse, Hiragi.
