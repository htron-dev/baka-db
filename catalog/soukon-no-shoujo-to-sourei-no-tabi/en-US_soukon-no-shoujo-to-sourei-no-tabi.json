    "sinopse": "The gods once planted seeds of grace known as \"Spirits\" in our land. Humans were eternally grateful to have the blessings of these Spirits. However, even they cannot escape mortality. The moment their time runs out, their bodies are enveloped in darkness and their surroundings with them. The only ones that can send these accursed spirits to their final resting place are \"Soul Senders.\" This is the tale of a young Soul Sender named Alpi. Through great sorrow and pain, she wields her blade.\n\n(Source: North Stars Pictures, translated)",
