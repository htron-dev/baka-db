    "sinopse": "Can one night lead to many more?\n\nWhen tycoon Graydon Gallagher lends Rebecca a shoulder to cry on at her ex-fiance's wedding, she doesn't expect to wake up next to him the following day! Exactly what kind of comfort has he given her?\n\nThen Gray makes a proposal -- he wants to take Rebecca on a business trip. But the question still remains: did they sleep together, or did they sleep together? Rebecca has to accept this assignment, not knowing if Gray's expecting to mix business with pleasure. After all, he's the boss -- and he could request her services after hours!\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
