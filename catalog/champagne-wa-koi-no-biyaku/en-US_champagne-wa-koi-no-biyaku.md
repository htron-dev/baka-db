## Sinopse

Can one night lead to many more?

When tycoon Graydon Gallagher lends Rebecca a shoulder to cry on at her ex-fiance's wedding, she doesn't expect to wake up next to him the following day! Exactly what kind of comfort has he given her?

Then Gray makes a proposal -- he wants to take Rebecca on a business trip. But the question still remains: did they sleep together, or did they sleep together? Rebecca has to accept this assignment, not knowing if Gray's expecting to mix business with pleasure. After all, he's the boss -- and he could request her services after hours!
