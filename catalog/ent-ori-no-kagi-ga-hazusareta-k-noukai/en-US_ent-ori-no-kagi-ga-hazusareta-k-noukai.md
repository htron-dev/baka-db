## Sinopse

In the world, people can be classified into three types: strong carnivores; middle carnivores and herbivores.

Somi Han is referred to as "Invisible girl." She befriends a fellow herbivore, Yujin Ko. However Somi Han feels that Yujin Ko is more like a tiger pretending to be a rabbit. Meanwhile, the entertainment industry is in an uproar with the appearance of a fanfiction writer called Foxstar. With incredibly detailed and accurate information about the personal lives of many of Korea's hottest stars, celebrities are more than nervous.

What happens when Somi and Yujin discover each other's secret identities?
