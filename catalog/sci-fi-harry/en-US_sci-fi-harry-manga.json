    "sinopse": "Harry McQuinn has always been an outcast at his school. One day started out no different than normal, except a classmate named Catherine stood up for him when the local bullies were ragging on him. She gets Harry to open up to her and is amazed when Harry shows her his unique ability of telekinesis, the ability to move things with his mind. Catherine is amazed at this ability. Unfortunately, Harry doesn't realize his powers have a dangerous side-affect to them: Every time he uses them, someone close to him dies.\n\n(Source: MU)",
