    "sinopse": "\"Naive\" describes Asahi Unowasa, a student who sits right in front of Azusa Ootani, perfectly. True to the meaning of his name, Asahi is shiny like the sun, and Azusa soon falls for him. Despite logically knowing that he can't be the only person who falls for Asahi, he doesn't like the idea of anyone else liking him either. When Azusa accidentally blurts out his feelings, they go from best friends to boyfriends. Not being able to shake the expression on Asahi's face the first time they did it, Azusa sets out various honeytraps to hopefully see that expression once again.\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
