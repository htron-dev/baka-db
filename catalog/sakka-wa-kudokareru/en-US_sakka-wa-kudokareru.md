## Sinopse

The cute young editor Takechi is assigned to the problem writer Tatehiko. Not only is Tatehiko grumpy, temperamental, and completely unconcerned about deadlines, he's also strikingly handsome, much to Takechi's dismay. Can Takechi manga both the Tatehiko's mood swings and his growing attraction to the writer at the same time?
