The Earth, as well as many other planets in the universe had been taken over by the Illumidus, a race of destructive humanoids who ruin, enslave or destroy almost any inhabitable planet they come across. In \"Endless Orbit SSX\" Harlock battles the Illumidus while searching for a mythical \"Planet of Peace\" where all the peoples of the universe can live freely and without war.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
