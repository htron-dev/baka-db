## Sinopse

Retired boxer Kazuya Shouji has long given up dreams of winning championship titles. He's now a coach and all his hopes are pinned on his protege, the upcoming pugilist Gaku. But the relationship between the two is not simply that of coach and student... "It's just that when I see the normally expressionless kid making a face like this, I can't help but get excited."
