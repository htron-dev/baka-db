    "sinopse": "Kamijou is the envy of all of his coworkers. At the office, he can solve any problem. Outside, he is chased by every girl under the sun. Kamijou, however, only has eyes for one girl: Xianglan, a Chinese immigrant who works as a waitress in the local Chinese restaurant. She can't see him as anything other than a customer, and her lack of fluency in Japanese prevents her from understanding him. Will Kamijou manage to woo Xianglan, or is he forever fated to fail?\n\n(Source: Shinnen and Pure Scans)",
