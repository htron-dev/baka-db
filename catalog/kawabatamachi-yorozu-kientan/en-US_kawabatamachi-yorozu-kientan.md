## Sinopse

One fateful day, the Suzushima Appraisal Research Company recruits Chisa Hirako, an unassuming college student, as a part-timer. Without much thought, Chisa enters the mysterious company and joins company president Suzushima and Uozumi to investigate "the authenticity of objects." Chisa soon discovers through his investigations strange coincidences and threads of clumsy romance.
