    "sinopse": "Puzzle fanatic Daimon Kaito has been crazy about solving brain teasers, puzzles and riddles his entire life. He attends the prestigious Root Academy with Nonoha, but spends most of his time creating and solving puzzles. Kaito is one of the few genius teenagers that attend the school who has been given the title Einstein, along with his other just as brilliant classmates who were given the titles Galileo, Edison and Da Vinci. Together, they attempt to solve a puzzle that, since its creation centuries ago, has never been solved. But the genius students soon realize that there are dangerous forces behind the impossible puzzle.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
