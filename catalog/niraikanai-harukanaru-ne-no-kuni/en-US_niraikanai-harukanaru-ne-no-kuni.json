    "sinopse": "Sumeragi Hotsuma, the blind \"Sound Master,\" can kill demons with only the \"sounds\" made by the ring in his hand. His partner is high school student Hiragi Ranku, adept at the strongest martial art, \"Sappo\" and blessed with the courage to fight any foe with her bare hands. A surprise, perhaps, that their enemies are gods. Their battle takes place in Okinawa, a mystical island that protects Japan from evil gods and demons.\n\n(Source: ANN)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 4: Oboro Yagyou",
