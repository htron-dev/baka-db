## Sinopse

One day a strict conductor was having a hard time achieving the sound he wanted from the orchestra he was leading. During a over-long rehearsal, he was late coming back from a break, and his little daughter Hibiki conducted the orchestra briefly in his place. Everyone was moved by the beauty of the music she directed, including the young violinist Kuzumi Akio, who only happened to be there watching.

Nine years later, Akio is entering college as a violinist, though he feels he has lost his passion for it. Over the intervening years, he was unable to recreate the feeling that Hibiki's music stirred in him. By an amazing coincidence, it turns out that Hibiki is entering the same college, as an aspiring conductor! Will Hibiki be able to help Akio rediscover what his music is missing?
