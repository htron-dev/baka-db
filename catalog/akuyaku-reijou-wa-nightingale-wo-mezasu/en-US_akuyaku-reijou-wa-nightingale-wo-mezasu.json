    "sinopse": "I reincarnated into the world of a European online novel?!\n\nWhen I realized I was in a novel world without route branching, I hit a wall from the very beginning for one simple reason. The main character of the original novel is a former doctor, but there is no way I can cheat and do the same. I can't help but wonder what I can do as a former mourning woman against so many capture characters. If this happens, I will aim to become a nightingale in this world!\n\nA medical slapstick romance that involves a former mourning woman who is wild and has not a single romantic bone in her body.\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)",
