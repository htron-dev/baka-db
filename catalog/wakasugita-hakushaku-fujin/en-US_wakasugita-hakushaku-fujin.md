## Sinopse

When Emily Blake innocently kissed formidable Italian count Rafael Di Salis, she didn't know that she was bound by her late father's wishes to marry him. Emily agreed to be the count's wife until she reached twenty-one... Count Rafael has bided his time. He's kept his passions under iron control for two years--his bride was young and he did not want to claim her until she was woman enough to handle him. But now she has come of age, she will be his!
