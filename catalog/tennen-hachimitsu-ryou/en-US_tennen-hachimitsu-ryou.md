## Sinopse

Yasushi has always carried a terrible burden--naturally curly hair. This unusual trait always brought only unhappy memories until one day a stranger comes to her aid. Meeting him again becomes her fondest wish. As she begins her life again and enters high school, she wonders what life on her own at the school's dorm will be like. Will she ever meet "her" golden haired stranger again?
