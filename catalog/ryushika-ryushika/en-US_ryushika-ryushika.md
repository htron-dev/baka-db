## Sinopse

A series of vignettes portraying the day-to-day life of a little girl with a very vivid imagination.

Lucika is crazy, totally crazy, like all children, infinitely curious, never short of absurd ideas, always ready to look at the world through a distorting prism of extraordinary freshness, it triggers disaster repeatedly around her!
