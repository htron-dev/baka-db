## Sinopse

A while ago, an amazing chef was sent packing for a mistake that he didn't commit. He promptly left the cooking world to the underground. Today, still shunned by the establishment, he survives as soldier of fortune. If you have a bad restaurant, if no one else can help, and if you can find him, maybe you can hire: THE Shoku king.
