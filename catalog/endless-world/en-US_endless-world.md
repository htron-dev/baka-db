## Sinopse

Ikki, an optimist who isn't afraid of anything, begins working at a small restaurant when he finds himself charmed by the owner. It's there that he runs into Ryuu, and from Ryuu, he hears a familiar name: Toshimitsu.

Neither Ikki nor Ryuu seem able to get away from Toshimitsu, and now their mysterious, shared past will lead to an unknown future.
