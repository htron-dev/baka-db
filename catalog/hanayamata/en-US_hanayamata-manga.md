## Sinopse

Normal appearance, normal intelligence, normal in arts and sports... just normal. This is the entirely normal 14-year-old, Naru Sekiya. While she admires "heroines" she continues to live a normal life until one moonlit night she meets a "fairy." This foreign girl then guides her into the extraordinary world of the yosakoi dance.
