    "sinopse": "Fumiya is always laughing, even when he's sad. That's how he's chosen to present himself and he continues doing so even when he's left the country, but a man named Lionel has the ability to see beyond his emotional facade and bridge the infinitely fractured distance between them.\n\nA lyrically written love story that chronicles the times happily spent together by a couple.\n\n(Source: Indigo Scanlations, Cosmique Scans)",
