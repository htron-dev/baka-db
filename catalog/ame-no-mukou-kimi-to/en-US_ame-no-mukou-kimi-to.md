## Sinopse

Fumiya is always laughing, even when he's sad. That's how he's chosen to present himself and he continues doing so even when he's left the country, but a man named Lionel has the ability to see beyond his emotional facade and bridge the infinitely fractured distance between them.

A lyrically written love story that chronicles the times happily spent together by a couple.
