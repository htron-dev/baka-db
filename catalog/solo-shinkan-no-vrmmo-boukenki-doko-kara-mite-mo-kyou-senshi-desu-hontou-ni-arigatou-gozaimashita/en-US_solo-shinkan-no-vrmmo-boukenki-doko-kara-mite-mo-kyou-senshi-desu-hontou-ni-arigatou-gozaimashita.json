    "sinopse": "Ryuu Shinjou is a student who is invited (forced) by his best friend to enter the world of virtual and online role-playing games (VRMMORPG).\n\nDuring the game and when choosing his class, Ryuu decides to become a \"priest,\" through which he can regain his health through magic and thus play alone. However, his playing style is far from what you would call a \"normal priest.\" It is time to learn the story from Ryuu, the priest who instills terror into anyone who dares to stand in his way.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
