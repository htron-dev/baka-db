    "sinopse": "Despite being in 3 clubs and 2 commitees, upperclassman Sasaki won't say, \"No,\" no matter how often he's asked to help out. As popular and integrated as Sasaki is, antisocial Ikuzo is out on the fringes, never joining in, yet for some reason this odd loner follows Sasaki around like a lost duckling. So why is it when Ikuzo pushes closer to an uncomfortable Sasaki, Sasaki just can't seem to leave him alone?\n\n(Source: MU)",
