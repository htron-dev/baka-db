    "sinopse": "\"Are you wet?\" He reads me a passage from his romance novel,and then touches me to see if I'm turned on...What is this?! The pleasure has taken over me,I can't think straight...!! I'm an editor for romance novels,but I've never actually had a boyfriend.The one day I finally decided to try on sexy underwear,the string came loose and they fell off on my way to work! Too embarrassed to even look back,I rushed to the meeting with my new author wihout wearing any underwear at all. But...why does he have them?! \"You're the only one who can be my new model.\" Suddenly,his body is on top of mine,and he's telling me I have to be the model for his sex scenes...What should I do?!\n\n(Source: Renta)",
