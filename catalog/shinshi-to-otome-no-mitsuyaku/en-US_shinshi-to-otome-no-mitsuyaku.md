## Sinopse

It's the nineteenth century, France is in turmoil and Marguerite, the daughter of the Marquis of Gerbeaux, is working as a weaver to hide her noble lineage from Napoleon's men. Her business takes her to the Port of Marseilles, where she meets a young, beautiful man and woman who look as if they've stepped out of a fine painting. Just as she's about to leave, gunshots ring out—and the woman's been hit! Marguerite saves the beautiful couple with her quick wits. But the man, Louis Jacques, seems more interested in Marguerite than his beautiful wife... even if he is still on his guard around her. Little does Marguerite know that her sensual, harrowing journey has just begun...
