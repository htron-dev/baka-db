    "sinopse": "The volume comprises 3 short stories.\n\nThe first one has a slight supernatural element to it, but is primarily centered on the relationship between a father and son. I feel obligated to add (as a just-in-case) that there are absolutely no incestuous undertones in this story.\n\nNext, we have a story that's kind of philosophical at points when it touches upon the interrelations between humans and existence.\n\nThe last story is on friendship, growth and love. It delves lightly into the background of the previous story's protagonist, Karino Yoshihito, as well.\n\nKarino Yoshihito is a character who also appears in \"Mizu ga Kooru ni Naru Toki\" and \"The Another Ocean\".\n\n(Source: MU)",
