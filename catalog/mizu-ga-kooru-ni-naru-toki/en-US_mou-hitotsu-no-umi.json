Chapter 4's an innocent story of a girl who has to learn how to swim (school life tag's for this chapter and the previous one). The ending chapter is a short slice of life piece on the mangaka's experience with colors and painting since young.\n\n\\*recurring main character in some of Nishi Keiko's stories; see \"Mizu ga Kooru ni Naru Toki\" and \"September\"\n\n(Source: MU)",
