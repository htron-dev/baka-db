    "sinopse": "Contains 5 chapters and the afterword.\n\n\"Promise\" and \"Since You've Been Gone\", which can be found in \"Four Shoujo Stories\", are included.\n\nWe open with a light-hearted story of a guy whose best friend is highly dependent on him on all matters. He tells his friend he can continue his clingy ways only if he were a dog. His friend goes missing, but then he comes across a dog...\n\nThe next two very solid chapters are \"Promise\" and \"Since You've Been Gone\". The former tells the story of a girl who keeps running into this mysterious young man whenever she is troubled. \"Since You've Been Gone\" is on a cheating man whose lover is trying to persuade him into taking a trip with her and leaving his wife for good.\n\nKarino Yoshihito\\* takes the stage again for the last two chapters; we get to know more about him when he was 26 and 15.\n\n\\*recurring main character in some of Nishi Keiko's stories; see \"September\" and \"The Another Ocean\"\n\n(Source: MU)",
