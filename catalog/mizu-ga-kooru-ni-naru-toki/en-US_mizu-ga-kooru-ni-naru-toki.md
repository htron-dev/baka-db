## Sinopse

Contains 5 chapters and the afterword.

"Promise" and "Since You've Been Gone", which can be found in "Four Shoujo Stories", are included.

We open with a light-hearted story of a guy whose best friend is highly dependent on him on all matters. He tells his friend he can continue his clingy ways only if he were a dog. His friend goes missing, but then he comes across a dog...

The next two very solid chapters are "Promise" and "Since You've Been Gone". The former tells the story of a girl who keeps running into this mysterious young man whenever she is troubled. "Since You've Been Gone" is on a cheating man whose lover is trying to persuade him into taking a trip with her and leaving his wife for good.

Karino Yoshihito\* takes the stage again for the last two chapters; we get to know more about him when he was 26 and 15.

\*recurring main character in some of Nishi Keiko's stories; see "September" and "The Another Ocean"
