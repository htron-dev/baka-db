    "sinopse": "In order to take care of his younger brother, Nozomi runs the Gattendou (sort of a jack of all trades) convenient store. For his most recent job he'll be acting as the body double for a yakuza's son, therefore he'll be protected closely by a bodyguard. But the bodyguard, Kusaka Yamato, fervently pursues him all while claiming he loves Nozomi. Nozomi has always earned a living himself for his and his brothers sake, but perhaps it wouldnt be so bad to rely on others every so often.\n\n(Source: MU)",
