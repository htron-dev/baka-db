## Sinopse

When Iga gets in charge of a small garden project in a rural area two hours away from Tokyo as an order by his father, he considers it a demotion, since he already had success in big, important plans. While trying to figure out why his father seems to think so little of him, his meeting with the representative of the project Asakura Yuu, a young but very kind man, helps him find the lost drive for his work and cope with the various problems in his life. On the other hand, Yuu feels as if he only receives help from Iga and tries to match up to him.
