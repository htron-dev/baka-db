## Sinopse

Hinata was corrupted by his stepfather and felt that he had lost the right to love his childhood friend, Tatsuya. He left home and became an escort to support himself. A pretty Shinto priest, Clayle, appeared and gave him the spear of the light’s fragment. Rele, knight of the sun shrine, appeared suddenly and told Hinata that he’d obey and protect the owner of the fragment. Clayle was imprisoned before they could find out more. What will happen from here?
