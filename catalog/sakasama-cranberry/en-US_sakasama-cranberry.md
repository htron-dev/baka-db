## Sinopse

Thirteen-year-old Meguru Kayano is just like any other middle school student, albeit with a slight brother complex. Her friends may think her feelings toward her brother are a bit weird, but they accept her nonetheless. Meguru's everyday life is enjoyable, save for her tension with classmate Takahi Aoyama. The two always get on each other's nerves and bicker over the smallest of things.

After an incident on a staircase, Meguru tumbles down, accidentally locking lips with Aoyama before her vision goes black. When she awakens, she is shocked to discover that she is not only two years in the future but is also now dating Aoyama! To make matters worse, if she wants to return to her own time, Meguru will have to kiss him again!
