## Sinopse

Ellen's beloved home is about to be sold. The prospective buyer is Max Vasilikos, the real-estate mogul. Ellen doesn’t care how rich he is. She's not going to let him have her house. But Max turns out to be an incredibly attractive man. When he finds out about Ellen's charity activities, he invites her to a charity ball. Ellen hesitates and says such a glamorous occasion isn't for someone like her. But Max insists and kindly escorts her to the party. Ellen keeps reminding herself that she mustn't fall for him, that he's only being kind because he wants her house.
