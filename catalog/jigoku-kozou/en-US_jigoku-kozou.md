## Sinopse

A mysterious old woman appears before doctor Rasetsu Emma, who has recently lost his son in an accident. She says she can bring Daio back to life. After agreeing to this sinister proposal, Daio returns to his father, but to Rasetsu's horror, he is half decomposed and inhuman. To make him human again, he needs fresh human organs. Rasetsu does everything he can to reincarnate his son, but Daio just turns into a different kind of monster. No one can stop him as he continues to feed his hunger, claiming victim after victim.
