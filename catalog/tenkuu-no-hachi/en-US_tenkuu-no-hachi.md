## Sinopse

Set in 1995. A helicopter, operated remotely, is hovering in the sky over a nuclear power plant. The power company, prefectural government and media all receive a fax. The fax contains a threat that if the nuclear power plant is not taken offline the helicopter will be dropped. 10 hours is given as the deadline. Making the situation even more dire, a young child is in the helicopter.

Kazuaki Yubara, who is the helicopter designer, and Yuichi Mishima, who is the nuclear power engineer, work frantically to save the child and find the criminal.
