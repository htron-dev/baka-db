## Sinopse

With the only thing she inherited from her parents being their once-great family name, the poverty-stricken Reiko Kujouin jumped at the chance for a scholarship to attend a prestigious school known called Meisei Private Academy. Why? Because of the ¥50,000 per month allowance and all her school supplies being paid for, of course! But little could she expect that, on her very first day of classes, she would be tackled from behind by another girl who, convinced that she's been reincarnated into the world of an otome game, accuses Reiko of being a wealthy villainess...!
