    "sinopse": "Eliza Kaldia, who reincarnated as a noble girl villainess in a fantasy otome game, was stuck in a world that seemed far from her image of how noble girls should be living, as the fated events of the game were still far off while she remained a child. In the first place, it was suspect if she could even live to make it to the school setting of the game. Due to changes in the situation of the neighboring country which never appeared in the original game, the world became nothing like the flowery school life from the game. It was a world where even young girls had to take up weapons. How did it turn out this way...?\n\nI don't have any cheat-like abilities. I can't use magic. My sense of ethics might have become a little twisted due to being reincarnated.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
