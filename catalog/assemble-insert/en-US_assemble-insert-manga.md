## Sinopse

A truly inspired parody of the super-powered crime fighter genre. Most of the character designs are caricatures, with a noticeable absence of noses. Full of in-jokes, and constant references to itself as anime.

The hero is a 14 (or so) year-old girl with super strength, who has been enlisted by the police force to entertain the populace while they wreak havoc fighting the "Demon Seed" crime organization.
