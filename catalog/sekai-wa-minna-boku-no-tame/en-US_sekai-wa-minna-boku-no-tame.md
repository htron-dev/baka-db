## Sinopse

Kiichi and Tsukasa have been best friends for practically forever. They’re always with each other, commuting to and from school by bike, laughing, fighting, watching movies ’til really late, and now, trying out for the basketball team. In fact, they’re around each other so much that a lot of people think they’re going out with each other. What a laugh! Kiichi can’t really think of Tsukasa as a girl… but then a cute new transfer student sets her sights on Kiichi and Tsukasa seems to have caught the attention of the captain of the boys’ basketball team… Life changes, and friends grow up.
