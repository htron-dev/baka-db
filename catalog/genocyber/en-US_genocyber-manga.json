    "sinopse": "It is panic at the Kuron institute: a guinea-pig escaped. And not just any guinea-pig: it is Elaine, a fourteen year old girl, endowed with immense powers. Her father, Professor Reed, performed on her an operation, the goal of which was to give her command of a psychic force equivalent to that of a nuclear fission. Elaine has a twin sister, Diana, resulting from the same experimentation. Both developed incredible mental abilities, but Diana is a handicapped person, with a body entirely robotized, whereas Elaine is a wild child, with an animal's nervous system. Together, they are the key of a discovery which would disrupt the world.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
