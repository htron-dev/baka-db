## Sinopse

"I've been thinking from the first time I saw you—it seemed like you'd have a big one."

While sitting in the waiting area, the receptionist, Kazama, appeared, full of androgynous sexual appeal. "Oniisan, do you like to be bullied?" In fact, Mizushima has trauma regarding SM. He tried to resist but was forced by his ex-girlfriend, and now, he has to try resisting again, but this time against another man?!
