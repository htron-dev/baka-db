    "sinopse": "Based on Jessica Steele's novel \"No Honourable Compromise.\"\n\nBy fair means -- or foul, Verity intended to win. Verity's dream of taking her rightful position in her father's company was snatched from her when her place on the board was given to someone else--and an outsider at that. \"That seat is mine,\" she raged when she confronted the overbearing Holt Jepherson. \"I intend to have it back!\" But instead of doing the honorable thing, Holt took her hand in a mock handshake and accepted the challenge. It was as if he were daring Verity to do her worst, and she'd never backed down from a challenge in her life--no matter what the consequences...\n\n(Source: fictiondb)",
