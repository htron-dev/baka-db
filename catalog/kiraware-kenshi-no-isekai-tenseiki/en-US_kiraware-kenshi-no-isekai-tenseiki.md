## Sinopse

Nobody acknowledged the MC, so he aimed to become the strongest in kendou in order to be acknowledged. However, he wasn’t able to become the strongest. He died from an accident and was reincarnated in a world where sword and magic exists. A world where those with black hair and black irises are avoided. Although difficult, once again he takes up the sword. "This time I’ll become the strongest". With that oath, the curtains open for the fight of the hated swordsman Urugu.
