    "sinopse": "With all its innovations, the kingdom of Tempest—founded by the demon lord Rimuru—is a veritable paradise for travelers such as Framea, the rabbitfolk chief's daughter. Framea has always had a nose for adventure, an inquisitive mind, and a knack for discovering and identifying the latest and greatest the world has to offer! Her notepad is open at all times, ready for any three-star delights she may encounter, so when Rimuru himself gives Framea a mission to catalog the area's attractions, she'll have her work cut out for her—and tons of stars to hand out!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
