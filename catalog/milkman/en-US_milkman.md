## Sinopse

The Milkman was born with the body that gets him mixed up in everything, and no matter where he goes, bad luck seems to follow him everywhere. He who gave up fighting destiny, is being yet again bullied by the landlord and yet somehow seems a bit happy. And in front of him, the “man who never gives up” the Coffee Milkman gallantly appears. Their meeting changes destiny?!
