## Sinopse

A collection of four short stories: Chapter 1 is the 100 page title story. It's a supernatural shoujo about a man with one chance to escape from death, a mysterious woman he meets, and a tribe seeking to find its way back into Heaven. Chapter 2 deals with the mystery of a man gone missing, and presumed dead. Chapter 3 is a very short story about a couple in the mountains who pick up a strange guest. Chapter 4 is a longer story about the traditions binding a family, those that would break away from them, and the dark secret that holds the family in sway.(Source: Storm in Heaven)
