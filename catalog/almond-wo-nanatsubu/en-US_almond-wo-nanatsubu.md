Hazuki is honest, awkward and a member of the product planning department. Watanabe, who has the top business performance, transfers into his department. Hazuki held animosity towards Watanabe, thinking that he has good looks with a good personality, unlike himself. But ever since Watanabe invited Hazuki out to eat on the weekend, Hazuki goes to Watanabe's house to eat hot pot, and the private time that they spend together becomes fun. However, Hazuki learns about Watanabe's secret, and their relationship starts to change...?
