## Sinopse

"Are you against being my sex-friend?"

The new employee Kazuma, who returned to Tokyo from America, reunites with his close friend from middle school, Ren, who is currently working as the top designer at their company. It is their first meeting since their abrupt farewell during their third year in middle school, 10 years ago. Ren was his best friend and his first love. He is as strong and good-looking as ever... And Kazuma is happy just being with him. However, Ren avoids the subject of their time in middle school rather unnaturally and acts like a friendly former classmate... But he's behaving this way because he is gay, and above all, fears being rejected by Kazuma. Yet one night, the two of them get together again...?!
