## Sinopse

Tooru and his sister Yume end up in hospital after a traffic accident leaving their father brain dead when suddenly Itou Yuuzen appears out of nowhere and takes them under his "religious cult's" protection. Is this the beginning of a new life for the brother and sister or something is hidden behind the facade of this religious cult?
