## Sinopse

One day, the Demon Lord barged into the palace and, instead of kidnapping the rightful princess Alice, he took Jean, her stunningly gorgeous brother! Alice, alongside her butler Seb and sibling duo Hatta and Haigha set out for the Demon Lord's castle. Her goal: not to rescue Jean but—in her own words—smack some sense into the Demon Lord for even daring to think Jean was the cuter one! Meanwhile, Jean and the Demon Lord are getting along well... maybe a little too well.

Will Alice be able to defend her feminine pride?
