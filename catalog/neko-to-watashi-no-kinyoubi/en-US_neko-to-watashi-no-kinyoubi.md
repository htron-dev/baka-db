## Sinopse

Ai loves cute things and chocolates but more than that she loves her senpai. He's popular with the ladies and is the son of a famous actress so she doesn't feel fit for him. While trying to figure out ways to confess to him, she's asked by her aunt to tutor her little cousin Nekota. Nekota's only a 5th grader but the year before Ai carried him to the hospital when he had a fever, and that's when he fell in love with her. He's not about to lose Ai to anyone and tells her right away that he'll steal her heart. At first Ai thinks it's ridiculous and that she loves her senpai, but soon she finds herself falling for the younger guy...
