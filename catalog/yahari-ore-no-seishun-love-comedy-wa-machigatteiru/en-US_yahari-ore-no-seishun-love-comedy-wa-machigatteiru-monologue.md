## Sinopse

Happiness, joy, and countless other positive emotions are cherished by many; however, in Hachiman Hikigaya's case, those emotions are ludicrous. Due to a traumatic past, his belief in happiness has completely crumbled. Following an essay he wrote criticizing modern social relationships, he is punished by his teacher, forcing him to join the Volunteer Service Club: a club whose sole purpose is to help schoolmates with their requests. Upon reluctantly entering the clubroom, he meets Yukino Yukinoshita—an ace student of unparalleled beauty. As they try to fix their schoolmates' problems, how will Hachiman's wretched view of society influence his solutions?

Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.: Monologue is a comedy-drama that revolves around the nihilistic Hachiman's high school life and his time in the Volunteer Service Club.
