    "sinopse": "For reasons that even she's unsure of, Tsuru finds her body inhabited by a rather self-centered, mischievous deity. What's even more unclear is why she has to lose her virginity to get him out! Fortunately, the presence of the deity within her affords Tsuru the ability to ward off evil spirits that afflict her childhood friend and object of her affections, Hikaru. What isn't so fortunate, however, is that she has to kiss the deity residing within her to do it!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
