## Sinopse

"At least until the rain stops… You can be my family."

Our protagonist is the building manager who works quietly and tries to put the memory of his abusive mother behind him. One rainy day a big-eared dog appears in his life. The moment the dog jumps on his head, he can hear the "inner voice" of other people's hearts…?!

A lonely young man and a miraculous, unusual dog in the rain: Bou-chan.

The story of a painfully lonely, yet kind young man and a small dog.
