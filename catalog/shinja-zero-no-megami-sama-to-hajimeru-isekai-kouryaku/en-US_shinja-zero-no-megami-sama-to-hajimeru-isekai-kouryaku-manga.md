## Sinopse

High school student and video game-lover Makoto Takatsuki dies in an accident and awakens in another world beside his classmates. However, he gains no cheat-like abilities, so he decides to become a "Magic Apprentice."

Then Noa, a minor goddess, appears before him. After she pleads and begs him, he decides to become her first believer. The weakest boy in the class becomes the strongest alongside the minor goddess in this another world fantasy!
