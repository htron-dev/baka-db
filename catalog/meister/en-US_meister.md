## Sinopse

Satomi High's Football Club members are bunch of weirdos, there's a former yankee (delinquent), a former Hikikamori, one short-tempered guy and on top of that their captain is a 'chibi' (shorty), who looks more like primary schooler than a 2nd year high schooler, but don't be fooled - despite the fact of being all-freshman brand new team in a brand new high school, those guys made it to the best 4 of Chiba Prefecture last year! Their newest recruit is an almost 2m high guy, who is surprisingly bad at headings (despite having a height advantage). Fortunately the chibi-captain notices his potential as an attacking midfielder... How far can this team possibly go in this year's tournament?

Volume 1: Striker Yoshitsune
