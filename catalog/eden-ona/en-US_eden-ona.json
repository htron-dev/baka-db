    "sinopse": "The sci-fi fantasy series Eden is set thousands of years in the future, where a city known as \"Eden 3\" is inhabited solely by robots whose former masters vanished a long time ago. On a routine assignment, two farming robots accidentally awaken a human baby girl from stasis questioning all they were taught to believe—that humans were nothing more than a forbidden ancient myth. Together, the two robots secretly raise the child in a safe haven outside Eden.\n\n(Source: Netflix, edited)",
