## Sinopse

"Backyard" is a town where video game characters spend their time when they're not being controlled by their players. All the characters live in that single town, going beyond the boundaries of the game. Liz, one of the female characters in the action RPG game "SMOG", is attracted to Saratoga, her senpai in the game. However, this forbidden feeling becomes a bug in the save data...!?
