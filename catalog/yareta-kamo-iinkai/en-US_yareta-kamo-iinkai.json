    "sinopse": "The manga's story centers on the titular \"committee,\" comprised of a martial artist, a musician, and an executive, who listen to the stories of clients who come in to hear their judgment. Clients come in and tell their stories about their romantic lives, focusing on points where they think they might have had sex, but ended up not doing it. The committee then delivers their judgment on whether or not they think the client might have actually ended up having sex at that point if something had been different.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
