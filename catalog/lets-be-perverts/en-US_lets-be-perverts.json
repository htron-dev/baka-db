    "sinopse": "Perverto is just a regular 17-year-old...with the unavoidable nickname, \"pervert.\" Unlike his namesake, he's actually quite naïve when it comes to sexual matters; his first and only youthful romance having ended terribly. To escape his bad reputation, he transfers to a new school for a fresh start. But on his first day there, he's falsely accused of groping a girl named Hongdan on the subway. To make matters worse, she happens to be another new student who has just transferred to his new school, to his very class. (Source: Netcomics)",
