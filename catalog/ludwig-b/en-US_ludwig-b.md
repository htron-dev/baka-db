## Sinopse

The young Ludwig von Beethoven struggles to make his way as a musician despite the exploitation of the aristocracy, harsh wars, degenerative health problems, and the personal persecution of a young nobleman, Franz Creutstein, who has chosen Ludwig as the target of vicious abuse fueled by Franz's rage over his mother's death and father's cruelty.
