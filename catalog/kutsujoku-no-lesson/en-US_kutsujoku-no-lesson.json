    "sinopse": "Model Alysha has been selected to become the face of a major cosmetics company's new campaign. When it turns out that the campaign's renowned photographer is Ross, she is forced to confront an unpleasant memory from five years ago. Back then, Alysha was a country girl who longed to be a supermodel—she barged into Ross's studio and bribed him into doing a camera test for her, but the price was steep and continues to haunt Alysha. After that humiliating first meeting, why on earth would Ross choose to work with her now?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
