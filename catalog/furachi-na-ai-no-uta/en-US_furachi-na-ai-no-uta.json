    "sinopse": "\"A\" and \"B\" met at the paradise-like Northern islands; \"A\" turns \"B\" into putty in his hands, using honeyed words and an aggressive attitude, but \"A\" is actually a selfish player! He wants to have both his fiancee and \"pig mouth\" at the same time, but this causes \"B\" to fall into an abyss of pain. Caught in this sad three person relationship, will \"A's\" final decision shock everyone?!\n\nIt (Chapter 1-3)\nA free-spirited and flamboyant high-school surfer, Yuuto, is best friends and best enemies with his 'second-in-command' Iusagi. Together with Aminato and Satori, they form a tight, happy-go-lucky clique. Well, until Yuuto discovers, to his bewilderment, that not only is Iusagi gay, but that Iusagi is into HIM! Of course, all it takes is a little encouragement from Iusagi, and timely interfering from the other two nosy sidekicks for Yuuto to see the 'light'.\n\n(Source: MU)",
