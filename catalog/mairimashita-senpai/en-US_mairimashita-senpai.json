    "sinopse": "Serina arrives at school one day to discover her desk has been vandalized—someone's scratched the lyrics to a love song on it...and that someone turns out to be Mizukawa-senpai, a boy who's one year her senior. She wants to get to know him better, but if his frosty demeanor is any indication, she doesn't have a chance! But it seems he might be awkward—not simply mean—and before she knows it, she's asking him out...! With each passing day, her heart races a little faster!\n\n(Source: Kodansha Comics USA)",
