## Sinopse

Even in the god's world, the stratified society exists. Kagachi, the patron god of the Hoozuki Shinto Shrine, lives as a god who doesn't stand out in a shrine that is called the Abolished shrine. He is pessimistic towards everything and always says, "Living is painful." One day, a girl appears in front of him. Her name is Nonomiya Haru. She forces herself to step into the shrine and live in it. Falling in love with a human girl, seeking for death all this while, the god's love story begins here!
