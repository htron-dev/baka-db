## Sinopse

Naru Samejima known as "Samejima the Unbeatable," is a yankee that loves fighting, but the only person he can't stand up to is Toraji, his two years younger brother's childhood friend. He's always saying that one day he'll kick his ass but when Toraji whispers "Naru-chan" in his ear, why does he find it impossible to resist?
