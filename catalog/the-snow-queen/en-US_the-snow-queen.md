## Sinopse

There once was a man called the most brilliant intellect and a woman with everything standing at deathâ€™s door. Their hearts were so completely frozen solid that nothing could melt them. What kind of light was it that could melt their hearts... is it absurd to think it was love? (Source: RC-Scans)
