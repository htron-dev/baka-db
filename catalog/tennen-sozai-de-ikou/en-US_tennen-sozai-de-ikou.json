    "sinopse": "Futami is an average girl in her school who isn't too special in any way. Even though this is so, she attracts very dynamic and popular people to her side. Friends with the two most popular girls at school, Futami thinks it's weird that they enjoy hanging around her so much. She thinks it's even weirder when the class prince starts to take notice of her too.\n\n(Source: Impossibility)",
