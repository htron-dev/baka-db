## Sinopse

The small, remote village of Dorodango is particularly noteworthy because it is populated almost exclusively by men. The seemingly delicate and docile Himeki Toono moves to this town with only one goal—to attract a lot of smoking-hot boyfriends.

As soon as she arrives, Himeki encounters many men, each equally handsome in his own right. In fact, there are so many that she can't decide which one to conquer first! From the tsundere brother type to the smart glasses-wearing type, all the men are certain to be vying for her attention—or so she thinks. In a short time, Himeki learns the horrifying truth: the village she assumed would be her playground of tantalizing men is filled with only gays!

According to legend, Dorodango suffers from a curse, causing only gay love to come to fruition. Surrounded by men who will never give her a second glance, can Himeki realize true love for herself?
