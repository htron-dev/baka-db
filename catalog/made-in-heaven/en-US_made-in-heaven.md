## Sinopse

After an accident, a young man named Kazemichi is given many prosthetic parts and told that he has been given a second chance at life. However, he is also told that his artificial heart has the possibility of giving out at any time. Kazemichi spends his days detached from the world until he meets a woman named Juri, and starts to once again regain feeling inside. Thus starts his search for the truths in his life - both the present and the past - as the end of his future draws startlingly near.
