    "sinopse": "Matsushiro Kouta has a crush on a pretty yet kinda cold classmate of his. Sasara, the self-proclaimed angel, appears for a sole purpose of helping him, but her love magic—activating after counting down from 10 to 0 by using specific methods—brings lots of trouble to the protagonist's life. Also, little does he know about his cute childhood friend's feelings and how Sasara is not the only angel out there...\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 6: Countrouble (pilot)",
