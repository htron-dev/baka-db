## Sinopse

College student Akane and salaryman Keisuke. They eat together, sleep in the same bed, and have a seemingly peaceful life. Keisuke thinks of Akane as a precious member of his family, so he is always gentle whenever they have sex. However, whenever Akane experiences that kindness, he feels guilty because of the secret he decided to keep from Keisuke.
