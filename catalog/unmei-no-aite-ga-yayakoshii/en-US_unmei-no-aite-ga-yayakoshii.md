## Sinopse

"We could just go to the hotel now, right?" Hiroto went and signed up with a dating agency when he was heartbroken, and the match he ended up with was a much younger, very cute girl! Their compatibility turns out to be 200%! They get along fine when she invites him to go to a hotel, and their bodies end up being a perfect match as well. Hiroto is overjoyed! However, when he meets up with her again, the person before him turns out to be a pretty boy who claims to have the same name!
