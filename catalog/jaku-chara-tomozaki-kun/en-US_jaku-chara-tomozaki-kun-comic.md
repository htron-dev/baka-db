## Sinopse

"Life is a shitty game. No matter how hard you try, you cannot overcome the characteristics given to you at birth."

To Fumiya Tomozaki, who feels he is trash-tier and can never compete with the god-tier humans in the world, this phrase is the truth. His one pride is in his position as Nanashi, Japan's number one player in the video game Atafami. However, one day, when he meets the rank two player face to face, his stance is challenged.

Is life actually the greatest game of all?
