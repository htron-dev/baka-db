## Sinopse

They day after a red shooting star fell to Earth, a man wakes up to find himself in an apartment with no memory of what happened up until that moment. Could he be "Char"? Or is he simply someone who just happens to look like him? One mystery just seems to lead to another mystery? A hillarious spinoff to Neo Gundam!
