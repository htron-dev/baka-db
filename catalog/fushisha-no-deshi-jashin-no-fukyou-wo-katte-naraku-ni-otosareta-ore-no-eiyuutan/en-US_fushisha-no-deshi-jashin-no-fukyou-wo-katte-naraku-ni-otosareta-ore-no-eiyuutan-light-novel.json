Ouch! Once there, he meets a mysterious girl...who happens to be undead. But despite her general dislike of humans, she decides to help him out. Can the two of them make it back to the surface? They might just be a more powerful combo than anyone was expecting!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
