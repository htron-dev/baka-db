    "sinopse": "Itsuki, who's deemed as unknown gender and is expected to be a beta, lost his parents when he was only 15 years old. Since then he tried his hardest and worked hard for his grandma and for himself. Somehow he managed to land a job as a servant under a well-known alpha family, but despite his enthusiasm in working there, he was met by a problem—one of his masters, the younger brother Kaisei, despises all genders and is somewhat hostile, while the older brother, Ujou, is very discriminating towards beta and omega alike. But this isn't the only obstacle Itsuki have to face when his real gender comes to light...\n\n(Source: MU)",
