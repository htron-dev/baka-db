## Sinopse

Death is the end... at least, that is the case for most people. After an ordinary salesman dies in a car crash caused by a couple making out, he is reincarnated in another world as a fierce and powerful dragon. However, being an evil dragon has its own share of problems, as adventurers and evil-beings alike seek him out in attempts to slay him.

Kuroe, one adventurer who hasn't given up on defeating the dragon, keeps facing him in order to test herself and prove her mettle. But after suffering another loss, Kuroe and the evil dragon "Ja" have a heart-to-heart. With a new understanding between them, they leave Ja's home and set off for town together. Though their companionship is brief, it paves the way for Ja's hilarious travels and his many encounters throughout the world.
