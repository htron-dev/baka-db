At the time, he learned about \"rental boyfriend\" by chance. He tried, booked someone, and the one who came was a really cool young man named Daichi. His body is perfect, and Takagi wasted no time seducing him to bed, but the service strictly prohibits sexual activities?! Takagi lost his interest in Daichi when...?\n\n(Source: Yaoi Is Life)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Sugar French",
