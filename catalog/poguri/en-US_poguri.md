## Sinopse

A poignant and hilarious collection of surreal comic with which Nakagawa us to a very personal world, masterfully mixing the absurdity, cruelty and poetry. We do not know if Poguri comes from another planet or another dimension, but clearly living in a universe that is not the land where electricity sucking bats, birds and camels cooked sushi burrow under the trees. However, Poguri emotions are those of a normal child.
