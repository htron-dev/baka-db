## Sinopse

Saphate is the second son of the Greed noble family. He hates the way his clan squeezes the money from the population and the way they waste it. When he went to oppose his family, he was kicked out. Although he lost his job at the Magic Academy and become a wanderer, he managed to live normally with his former elf colleague and a cat maid that worked for his family and that left her work for following him. This is a story that narrates his everyday life.
