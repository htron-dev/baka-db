When he went to oppose his family, he was kicked out. Although he lost his job at the Magic Academy and become a wanderer, he managed to live normally with his former elf colleague and a cat maid that worked for his family and that left her work for following him. This is a story that narrates his everyday life.\n\n(Source: MU)",
