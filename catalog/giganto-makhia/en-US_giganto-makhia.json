    "sinopse": "In a future one hundred million years away, after history has ended, myths have returned to life and giants stride across the land. Also wandering this world are Delos the wrestler and his odd partner Prome. Their mission brings them deep into an inhospitable desert where they make contact with the Scarabaei, a race of scarab people.\n\nHowever, the Scarabaei have long suffered at the hands of a human empire encroaching on their lands, an empire they assume the very human Delos and his companion are part of. Forcing Delos to stand for the Empire's crimes, he is thrust into an arena with the Scarabaei's champion fighter Ogun. With his life on the line, Delos must not only confront this formidable warrior, but also the feelings of a whole tribe. Justice, pride, and survival hang in the balance.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
