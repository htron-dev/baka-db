## Sinopse

A cat went in the hot-tempered KANG Jae-Young's villa.
Forbid approach to my room and my library.
Things must be always in place.
I hate messy things and clamor.
Just follow the rules!
Darn! >v<
I won't be daunted.
It's not like that I want to live passively and say no other words but "meow meow".
Seems to be acting modestly, and all of a sudden extrudes the claws while sounding "Grr.." like a wild cat.
Kya~!
Now can love be formed?!!
Let's wait and see.
The vicissitudinous cohabitation diary~
