## Sinopse

A comedy 4-koma manga revolving around the normal life at school of the minor characters of Fate/stay night and Fate/hollow ataraxia, specifically the character Himuro Kane, classmate of Fate/stay night protagonist Emiya Shirou.

This manga by Mashin Eiichirou is a spin-off that tells the normal school life of the supporting characters Himuro Kane, Makidera Kaede, Saegusa Yukika. Other characters are the regular cast of the main games: Mitsuzuri Ayako, Tohsaka Rin, Ryuudou Issei, Matou Shinji, Emiya Shirou, Kuzuki Souichirou, Fujimura Taiga, Matou Sakura, Mitsuzuri Minori; "guest" characters from other series Ciel, Seven, Sajyou Ayaka (formerly the heroine of the never finished prototype novel of Fate/stay night) are also featured, and other classmates Gotou Gai, Fujimoto, Dezaki, Hirumata.
