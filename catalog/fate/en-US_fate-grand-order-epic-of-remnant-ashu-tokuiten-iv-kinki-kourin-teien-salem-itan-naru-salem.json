    "sinopse": "As a result of the efforts of the people of Chaldea, the human incineration plan of those who called themselves the Magic King was bitterly stopped at the water's edge, and the destiny of the world seemed to be breathing again. However, suddenly, the singularity of the same level as the singularity so far is observed in modern times. A master who has opened up the future once again puts himself into a layershift to calm down the \"subspecies singularities\" that appeared in the cursed land \"Salem.\"\n\n(Source: MU)",
