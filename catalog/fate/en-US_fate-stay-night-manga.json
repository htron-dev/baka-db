Seven sorcerers known as \"Masters\" summon a powerful familiar called \"Servants\" and they all fight each other till the last one. The last one is said to attain the Holy Grail which will grant them a wish.

Admiring his stepfather, he has been training himself to be a sorcerer. However, he had no talent and he could barely use one type of sorcery. His stepfather has already passed away, and today he's a sorcerer without any skills or knowledge. He is involved in the War of the Holy Grail when he accidentally summons Saber, who is said to be the strongest servant of all...\n\n(Source: MU)",
