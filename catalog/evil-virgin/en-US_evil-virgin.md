## Sinopse

Nurunuru Pharmaceutical’s leading product, the Piagra, helps men bring up and maintain their sex drive. To further develop their research, the president of the company has hired a succubus. Known for their sexual drive and ability to manipulate male sexuality, the employees imagine a very foxy woman. But when they see that the succubus is Yamashita Madoka, a young innocent looking girl who is just as pure as she looks, they don’t know what to expect. Will Madoka be able to contribute anything to the company even if she is a virgin?
