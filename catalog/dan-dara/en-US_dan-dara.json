    "sinopse": "Centuries ago in Japan, the country was in turmoil with revolts against the government. It was especially bad in the capital city of Kyoto with revolutionists quickly gaining momentum. It was up to the Shinsengumi to put a stop to all of this and bring order back to the city. The famous leaders such as Okita, Hijikata and Kondo must work tirelessly and cut as many people down if they want to bring peace back to Kyoto.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
