## Sinopse

Hibari Hanagokanei is a very enthusiastic preteen that would love to have a patapi mascot (a very popular tamagotchi-like toy) and dreams a lot about a boy, whom she calls "ojiisama" (prince). One day, an ecchi old man tells her that her prince is waiting for her in the local hill. Hibari runs to meet him, but she only finds a patapi mascot that falls of the sky into her arms. Not only has she proven that his prince is real, but he gave her a gift. Nevertheless, a big-breasted woman tries to steal her new patapi, which transforms into a Diva.
