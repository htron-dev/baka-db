## Sinopse

Two young women start their freshman year at a university. One would never assume these two have anything in common, but they meet by chance in the room belonging to this university's mountaineering club. Climbing may be tough for the two who have never done any sports, but the other members of this small, dedicated club are determined to keep the freshmen around so that the club isn't disbanded for low membership.
