    "sinopse": "Erika Sakura is her high school's most popular and attractive girl—many guys would love to date her and the girls worship her. For the sake of her reputation, she cannot see herself in a relationship with someone such as her classmate Kuzumi who is lame, boring, and dull. Unfortunately, fascinated with his quirky actions and lifestyle, Erika's mind is filled with Kuzumi and she seems unable to keep her eyes off him.\n\nErika's interest in Kuzumi causes her to see the type of caring person that he really is. As other classmates chime in with curiosity about the school's madonna, events lead to Erika associating with the last person she ever expected to be involved with.\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2, 5: Soga ga Kininaru! (pilot)",
