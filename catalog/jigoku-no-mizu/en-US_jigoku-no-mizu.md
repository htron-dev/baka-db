## Sinopse

Tokyo University Professor is suddenly awoken in the middle of the night by what appears to be an enormous 6 sided dice sitting in his garden.

Perplexed by this sudden appearance, the professor, with the help of some locals, set about cracking open the dice to see what's inside with ghastly consequences.

Curiosity soon turns to despair as the Professor realizes that he has just unleashed a grudge bearing water demon from the Himalayas that has come to Tokyo in search of his blood!
