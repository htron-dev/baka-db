## Sinopse

Reaching the end of his college years, trying to find a job, Sakurazaka Kouhei was reaching the end of his rope. Months were dragging by, with no job offers in sight. If he didn't find something soon, he would have to go home and take over the family business. Then he spotted it. Suruga Systems Corporation, a small data processing company.

Accepted at once for the job, little did he know what he was getting into...
