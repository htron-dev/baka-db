## Sinopse

Yun-Ook Jang is a 26-year-old freelance illustrator who rents out a room to help pay off her debts. Her tenant is a 19-year-old drop-out named Bum-Moo Lee, who only has a part-time job. Before Yun-Ook knew how old Bum-Moo was, he seemed rather mysterious and cold to her, and the two argued all the time. Little does she know that Lee is a kid who should be going to school!
