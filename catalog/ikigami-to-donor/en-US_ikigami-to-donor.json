    "sinopse": "\"Your blood and flesh, all of it is mine.\" An ikigami and a healer, together their souls support each other, blooming into love...\n\nIn the distant future, ordinary teacher Yoshino learns that he is a \"donor\" for the strongest species, the \"ikigami.\" These warriors are tasked with protecting the country. \"The unique ability of a donor is to use their bodily fluids to heal ikigami.\" Yoshino learns this fact and is shocked. Thus, Yoshino is forced to live with Kidou... At first, he is like a beast, demanding Yoshino's bodily fluids, but slowly, the underlying loneliness begins to show...\n\n\"Someday, if I met a donor, could they come to love me? That thought is the only reason I survived...\"\n\n(Source: Shodensha, translated)",
