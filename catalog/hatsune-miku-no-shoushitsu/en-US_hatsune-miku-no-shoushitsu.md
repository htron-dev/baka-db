## Sinopse

Asano is a young university student tasked with testing out the technology department's newest creation—the life-like android, Hatsune Miku. Although Hatsune Miku has a lot to learn, Asano comes to see her as more than merely a piece of tech and together the two learn what life and love is all about.
