    "sinopse": "Everyone remember that classic story of \"Journey to the West\", where 3 travelers help a monk to right their misdeeds?\n\nThis is not that story...\n\n\"Chinyuuki: Tarou to Yukai na Nakama-tachi\" is a parody of \"Journey to the West\", where an assassin by the name of Tarou Yamada is trying to right his misdeeds by travelling with a monk. Tarou's misdeeds were essentially assassinating tons of people and pooping on their graves. A monk saw him and cursed him into a baby-monkey-hybrid-thing. With the help of the Monk, Tarou has to battle demons and other weird anomalies to help regain his human form.\n\n(Source: TV Tropes)",
