## Sinopse

The oldest of the twins, Ikurou, is at the top of his year in academics. While the younger brother, Akaya, is below average, and Ikurou holds a superiority complex with him. However, when he feels Akaya’s gaze on him, he is reminded of what happened five years ago, when Akaya asked him, “Can I touch you,” and Ikurou feels driven into a corner.
