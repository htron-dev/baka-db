## Sinopse

Odamaki Hana, 17, female, high schooler. Kine Shougo, 38, male, engineer. One day, they suddenly swap bodies. After living in the other's body for a year, they meet again by chance. The man in the girl's body has refined their look and is now a model; the girl in the man's body lost their job and is treated as an amnesiac. The "self" they now encounter has become an entirely different "self."
