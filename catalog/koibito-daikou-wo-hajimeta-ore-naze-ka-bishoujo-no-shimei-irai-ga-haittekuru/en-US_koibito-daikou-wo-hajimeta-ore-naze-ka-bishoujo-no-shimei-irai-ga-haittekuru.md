## Sinopse

Ryoma Shiba, a poor college student, looking for a part-time job with a high hourly wage, and Himeno Kashiwagi, who desires a relationship while telling everyone around her that she is disinterested in love.

Simultaneously, they discover about "Lover's Agent" from mutual connections, so they register straight away and ended up scheduling a date.

On the day of the date, the two meet for the first time, and despite their nervousness, they spent a lovely time holding hands and drinking tapioca, just like lovers.

However, when Himeno's friend finds out the truth, things get awkward. Ryoma lies to her and tells her that they are dating. Himeno's heart skips a beat when Ryoma pretends to be her actual boyfriend. This is a true love story that begins with a rental relationship.
