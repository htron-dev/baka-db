## Sinopse

The heroine is 27 year old Airi. She has just left a job as an office lady, and is not too happy about her previous career. One day at the beach she is yelling out her frustration at her old boss to the waves when she spots a cute guy wearing only a towel. (he’s barely wearing that!) Airi thinks he is strange until she realizes he is a surfer, and is changing out of his wetsuit. She gets into her car to leave, but in a bit of clumsy driving, she manages to run into someone. Yep, she hits surfer boy! His foot is injured, and in her panic to help him, she drives him to the first place she can find where he can get cleaned up- a Love Hotel Yow! Airi doesn’t realize she took him to a love hotel until they are actually in the room.

Yeah, Airi does not seem to be the brightest girl out there. Meanwhile cute boy, who tells her he is only 17, gets cleaned up in the shower. His foot is okay now, and he immediately starts putting the moves on Airi. I mean, they ARE in a love hotel. But Airi pushes him away, and they part. Airi can’t believe herself though, she was actually attracted to him, and he’s only 17! That’s a 10 year difference! Through a suitably shoujo-manga-ish set of plot twists, Airi takes up a position as an administrator/principal at a boys school. Guess who is a student at her school… yeah, her 17 year old surfer boy. His name is Ryuusei, and Airi finds, to her horror, that she is still attracted to him. He seems to like her a lot too, but can they really have any sort of future, given their age difference?
