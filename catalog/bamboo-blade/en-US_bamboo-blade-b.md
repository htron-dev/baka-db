## Sinopse

Ookido Yuu is an extremely tall girl who just entered middle school. Because of her height everyone is trying to recruit her into their sports club, even though she is terrible at them. Her childhood friend, Ken-chan, who is still in Elementary school, keeps on telling her to join the Kendo club. But she hates Kendo, because she never had a single victory against him.
