But Kuro's true nature is that of a dog tengu, a harbinger of calamity. \"I'll bring you misfortune.\" \"So what? Stay with me, Kuro.\" In his human form, Kuro can't hold himself back when faced with the sweet fragrance of the bird tengu he loves. And so they share their first time and first heats with each other.
