## Sinopse

1. Tsuki no Sabaku
   Armageddon. The powerful weapon "Messiah" has ended the long war, leaving behind a barren wasteland. A boy wanders west, seeking the paradise that lies at the edge of the world. The man who created the weapon runs from those who would use him. Scattered by the winds of destruction, they meet, part ways, and then meet once again.

2. I'm Not Fit to be a Detective
   An incompetent detective, born loser, and die-hard pacifist...so why on earth is Yagi suddenly commissioned with the task of driving a stubborn young woman out of the home that she claims her recently deceased grandfather left for her in his soon-to-be-revealed last will?

3. Dream Dweller
   A little boy who 'hates' his strict grandfather makes a new friend...

4. Snowflakes
   The love between a boy and his half-sister, set against the backdrop of a Japan soon to be torn apart by WW II.
