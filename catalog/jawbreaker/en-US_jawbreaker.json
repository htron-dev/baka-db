    "sinopse": "Logan's come home for summer break, and he's depressed. He'd always dreamed of a college life of non-stop banging, and yet he's never even gotten to first base. Girls run away when he tries to pick them up. Then... he meets up with his quirky childhood friend Daniel, whom he hasn't seen in ages. Logan vents about having never been kissed, and to his shock, Daniel offers himself up for practice!! Logan laughs it off at first, but out of desperation not to end his youthful days untouched, he finally agrees. But, turns out Daniel is an amazing kisser...! An inexperienced college student fumbles his way into intimacy with his nerdy, closet-bottom friend!!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
