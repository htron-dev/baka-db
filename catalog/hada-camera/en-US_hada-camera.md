## Sinopse

Because he did not pass his college entrance exam, Kagami Kyousuke cannot stay close to Koujou Hikari, the love of his life. So instead he gets a part-time job near her university and buys an old camera, since Hikari is passionate about photography. But as it turns out, that camera also has a secret which will get him involved in all sorts of "exciting" and "awkward" situations especially with Botan Oshikiri, his senpai and co-worker. How will Kyousuke's life play out now?
