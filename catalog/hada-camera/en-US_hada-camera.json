    "sinopse": "Because he did not pass his college entrance exam, Kagami Kyousuke cannot stay close to Koujou Hikari, the love of his life. So instead he gets a part-time job near her university and buys an old camera, since Hikari is passionate about photography. But as it turns out, that camera also has a secret which will get him involved in all sorts of \"exciting\" and \"awkward\" situations especially with Botan Oshikiri, his senpai and co-worker. How will Kyousuke's life play out now?\n\n(Source: MU)",
