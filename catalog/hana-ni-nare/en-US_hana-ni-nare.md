## Sinopse

Momo Yamada wanted to be a flower when she grew up, but she's blossomed into nothing more than a rather homely teenager. When her grandmother passes away, Momo becomes a live-in maid for the two sons of a elegant fashion designer. After the eccentric eldest son, Ranmaru, gives Momo the makeover of her life, she discovers that her mother was a legendary Hanabito, a beautiful woman with a divinely intoxicating scent that draws men to her like bees to nectar. What's more, Momo learns that she, too, gives off that same irresistable aroma. Although she and Ranmaru have fallen in love, their relationship now must withstand constant assault from handsome boys and men who desire to abduct and seduce Momo.
