## Sinopse

The Lord of Sanwa’s son Lamkha saves Kanan, who collapsed on the road, and brings her home. In Sanwa, where the Messengers of Heaven or Flying Serpents roam the skies, a legend has been passed down the generations. According to the legend, a Holy Dragon fell from the heavens following a battle against a Black Dragon and was buried in Sanwa. What is the truth behind the legend?
