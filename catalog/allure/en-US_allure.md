## Sinopse

Sight unseen? Not exactly. Feel the Allure of the known.

Blinded in a freak accident, Kai's vision is restored years later through a corneal transplant. His new eyes, however, can't seem to focus on his family or girlfriend. They are instead drawn to Hizuki, the surgeon who performed the operation.

Is it because of the doctor's alluring scent, which Kai finds strangely familiar? Or could it be because the transplanted corneas last belonged to Hizuki's lover...?
