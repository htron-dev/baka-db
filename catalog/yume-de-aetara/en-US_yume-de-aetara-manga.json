All that changes when he meets the beautiful Nagisa Shiozaki at a marriage interview pub, who herself has had the same poor luck with guys. Now he'll do anything to woo the girl, but he'll have to fend off other suitors and the affections of a co-worker, while keeping himself out of awkward situations that always end badly for Masuo.\n\nfrom Baka-Updates Manga",
