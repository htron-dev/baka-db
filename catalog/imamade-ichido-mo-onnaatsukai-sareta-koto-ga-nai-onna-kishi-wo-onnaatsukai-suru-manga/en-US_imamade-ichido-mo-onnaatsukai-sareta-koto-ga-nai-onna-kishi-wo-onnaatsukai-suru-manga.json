    "sinopse": "Leo Cornelia, also known as the Undefeatable Holy Blade, is hailed as the strongest knight in all the land. It's precisely this strength that has barred anyone from treating her like a proper woman before⁠—that is, until sorcerer Houli Dent comes along! He professes his love to Leo out of the blue, but how will she handle being treated like a lady for the first time in her entire life?\n\n(Source: Sol Press)",
