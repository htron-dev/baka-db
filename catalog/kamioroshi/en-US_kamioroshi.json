    "sinopse": "Rumors about love fulfillment charms sold by a Shinto shrine, and the students who came there for an extracurricular activity. Among them were Kuryuu Izumi and Shikiyomi Mikoto. Those two are matchless geniuses among the other students from the same school year but, they always end up exchanging cynical words when they meet each other. Those two's relationship had nothing to do with a love fulfillment charm. The other students were a strange bunch. Believing in the charm's power, and conscious of each others. But that frivolous atmosphere will change completely. The childish love fulfillment brings deaths, one after another. This is a curse. Or could it be... What is the truth that Izumi and Mikoto knows as they're drawing near the source of the mystery?",
