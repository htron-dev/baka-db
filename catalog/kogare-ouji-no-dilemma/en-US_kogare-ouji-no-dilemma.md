## Sinopse

Simple and straightforward Yuuto was deceived by his old teacher and forced to shoulder his debt. With no way to pay back such a large amount of money, he is sold off at a black-market auction. There, mysterious men wearing masks bid on Yuuto. The one who bought him turns out to be none other than the prince of a foreign country! What will become of Yuuto when he is told by this high-handed prince, "Be my lover"...!? Now a sexy and gorgeous love story will unfold inside the palace. Beautiful men, holding onto love, overcome their class difference.
