## Sinopse

Alice Tobe, the student vice president at the all-girls Margaret Academy, always speaks badly of boys. Ikuo Bene, the vice president of the neighboring boys school Kigiku Gakuen, doesn't believe in love. But when they have to work together for their schools' annual joint Cultural Festival, a new story unfolds. A modern take on the classic Shakespeare comedy Much Ado About Nothing!
