Having lost his father when he was still a child and his mother not too long ago, he is more than surprised when he is told that he's the last living heir to the prestige Goshoizumi Family. In 3 Months, he will be made the head of the family— if he proves himself worthy.\n\nTo teach Akira what he need to know in order to become a respectable leader, three young men whose family share a deep bond with the Goshoizumi become his mentors: the antiquary Tsukasa Reizei, the actor Ko Tokieda and the novelist Shizuku Tojo. They all aim to be his \"saya\" the most powerful man in the family beside the head. But who will Akira choose? And who will his heart choose?",
