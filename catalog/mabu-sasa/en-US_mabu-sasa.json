    "sinopse": "Akira Sasagawa is a typical high school girl: cute, bubbly... and completely obsessed with BL. One day, she spots her fellow classmate, Mabuchi-kun, at her favorite bookstore, in her favorite aisle, and her fervor is ignited: could a rough-and-tumble, mean-eyed guy like him possibly love BL too? Her quest to find out leads her to a conclusion even she can't believe, and their otaku romantic comedy of errors begins!\n\n(Source: Kodansha)",
