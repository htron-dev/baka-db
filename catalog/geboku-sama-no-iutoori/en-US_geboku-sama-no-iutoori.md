## Sinopse

In an era when vampires and humans coexist, having one's blood sucked by a smart and beautiful night walker is considered a status symbol. Shion's tired of sucking the blood of stuck-up women. One night, he runs into and becomes infatuated with Hajime, an average-looking office worker who smells delicious. Hajime, however, is a glutton for punishment, and wants the arrogant Shion to treat him like a slave in exchange for his blood. Shion reluctantly agrees... He hates it, but the pleasure is too much to resist. Will Hajime end up going to town on his cute new master!? This is a love story between a depraved human and a pushy vampire.
