Mischievous Katou decides to use what he saw that evening to his advantage, and the next day, Koshigaya finds himself cornered in the chemistry lab. Science is about to get sexy!\n\nLove Chemistry Lab features seven sizzling, smut-tastic stories of hot and horny boys looking for love as they deal with drama, discover hidden desires, and explore all kinds of kinks.\n\n(Source: DMG)",
