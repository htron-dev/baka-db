    "sinopse": "Beautiful, excels at both academic and extra-curricular activities, and well behaved—such are the qualities of the capable and infamous student council president, Asuka Ichijou. However, contrary to his spotless reputation, he serves as his father's personal prostitute who sells his body within and outside the school premises. This well-guarded secret eventually comes out in the open, as Zaizen, the transfer student who also happens to be someone dear from Ichijou's past, catches proof of his negotiations.\n\nOne day, Zaizen enters the Ichijou residence unannounced and proceeds to drag Asuka out. Confused, Ichijou demands an explanation to which Zaizen simply responds with \"I've just bought you.\"\n\n(Source: Kaiousha, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Hatsukoi Glitter",
