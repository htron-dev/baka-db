## Sinopse

Otoji is an innocent boy, who's searching for his missing older brother in seedy, urban America. During this search he meets up with Joe, a fashionable prostitute who eventually joins him with his search. Joe, who knew Otoji's brother, tells him about his brother's forbidden love toward him, a thing that Otoji have never wanted to know. And more than that—Joe may know how to find him.

As the search continue, Otoji gets dragged into Joe's lifestyle—from gun fights and sexuality to body selling—and discovers new sides of himself and his personality. Is the most important person in his life is still his brother? With Joe next to him, things may change.
