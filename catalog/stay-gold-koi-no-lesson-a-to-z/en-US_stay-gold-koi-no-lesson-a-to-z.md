## Sinopse

After a failed attempted at bleaching his hair and ending up in a fight on the day of the entrance ceremony at his high-school; Ken is already off to a bad start with a bad first impression as nothing more than another delinquent.
Mizuki, Kens best friend and secret crush, was the only person he met after that not to label him negatively just because of his appearance, but maybe that's because neither is Mizuki just the cute and innocent guy he appears to be.
