    "sinopse": "Kouji is a lethargic high school student who walks aimlessly through life. One day, he stumbles upon a young boy sleeping beneath a tree. On either side of the boy are a dog and a cat, all three bathed in broken sunlight streaming through the leaves above.\n\nBefore long, Kouji comes to realize this boy, Daichi, is like him. Both possess the ability to hear the voices of objects and animals. Well, \"possessED\" in Kouji's case. Kouji lost his powers long ago…or so he thinks…\n\n(Source: Spoils)",
