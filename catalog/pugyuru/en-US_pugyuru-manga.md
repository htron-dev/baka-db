## Sinopse

Ma\*\*\* is a seemlingly ordinary girl who one day meets a tiny maid-creature named Cheko-chan. However, she is not what most anime/manga fans think of as a maid, but instead a strange creature with lots of mysterious and funny behaviors. Soon more friends of Cheko arrive for more and more weird side characters.
