## Sinopse

Compilation OVA of the Wansa-kun series.

Reminiscent of Disney's Lady and the Tramp, this work depicts the friendship between Wansa, who looks for his mother, and his friends.

Wansa-kun was originally developed as the mascot character for the Sanwa Bank. The character was used for the TV series, and Tezuka Osamu was credited only as the writer of the original story.
