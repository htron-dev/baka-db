## Sinopse

For his art project Mikuriya Jin carved a statue from the recently chopped local sacred tree. As he is about to bring it to school, the goddess of the tree, Nagi, descends upon the statue, having slept until now, not knowing of her demise. Since the sacred tree can no longer protect the surrounding area from impurities, Nagi has to do it herself now, dragging poor Jin with her.
