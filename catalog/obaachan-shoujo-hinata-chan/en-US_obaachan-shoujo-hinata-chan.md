## Sinopse

Worldly knowledge and artistic refinement! Hinata-chan is on a completely different level to your average toddler, but she has a secret. She’s the reincarnation of an 88 year old grandma, with her memories intact! Enjoying green tea on the veranda, a taste for pickles, and an old-fashioned dialect! Why has she been reincarnated? A comedy full of old-wives wisdom!
