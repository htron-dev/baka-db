## Sinopse

If you were a teacher, what would you do if you found out that the murderers of your child happen were two of your students? Would you let their fate to be decided by the law - if you knew the law would let them get away scot-free, or would you seek revenge yourself? Between ethics and justice, which would you choose? The comic version of the popular film "Kokuhaku," perfectly capturing all of the drama and impact of the lauded original.
