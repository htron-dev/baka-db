## Sinopse

Takayama Naoto, 2nd-year student at Kiryu Tetsudou High School, has been selected to intern at the infamous "Public Rail Road Security Corps," much to Naoto's chagrin. He only wanted to be assigned to a safe, relaxed group to live quietly for the rest of his life. Now he ends up in one of the most dangerous work-places in Japan. This group is the first line of defense against the extreme-leftist group fighting to privatize the railroads. Considering his lack of training or motivation, will he be able to survive the rail wars?
