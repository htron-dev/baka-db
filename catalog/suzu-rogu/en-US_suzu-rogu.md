## Sinopse

On January 3rd, 2097, a collision with a celestial object basically destroyed human civilization. Seventy years later, human survivors are still living in space, unable to return to their home planet. Some humans, called "Divers" are able to project an avatar to the earth in order to salvage information from earth-based computer networks.

Suzuro is a 14-year-old freelance diver of incredible skill, but only a C-rank due to age restrictions. She works in a salvage ship with her pilot Ginga, who keeps the ship out of flying debris while she's connected to earth, and her assistant Shimugi. It's not only space debris colliding with the ship that could kill Suzuro while diving, there are also dangers waiting on earth that could kill her, just by interacting with her avatar. Suzuro must be certain that the cases she takes are worth the danger!
