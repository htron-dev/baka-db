    "sinopse": "It's been three years since they broke up, but now Dray, Cass's ex, has appeared before her once more. The way he broke up with her was downright cruel, so what could he possibly want now? Her little sister married his younger brother, and up to this point she'd been lucky enough to not have to see him at all. Dray had the same beautiful blue eyes as before, and he stared coolly at Cass while he told her that Pen had passed away, leaving behind a baby. Pen's death will have repercussions for Cass and Dray's relationship that the heartbroken Cass can't yet imagine.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
