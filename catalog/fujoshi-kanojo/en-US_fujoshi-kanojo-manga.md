## Sinopse

Mutou Taiga is an average college student who falls in love at first sight with Ameya Yuiko, a senior at his part-time job. He bravely confesses to her and succeeds in starting a relationship. However, Yuiko tells him that she's a "fujoshi." Clueless to what it meant, Taiga assures her that he's okay with that, not knowing what he was getting dragged into.
