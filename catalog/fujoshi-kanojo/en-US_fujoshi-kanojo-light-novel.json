Each day I am dragged further and further into the world of otaku. I cannot be held responsible for any damages incurred by reading this blog and falling into the same predicament.\n\nThere is much otaku talk contained within, so please follow your directions carefully, and do not exceed your recommended dosage.\n\n(Yen Press)",
