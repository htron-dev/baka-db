    "sinopse": "Bard, a young alpha beastman, has admired his father—the king of his people—since childhood, and adored the strange and wonderful gifts he brought home for him. Immortalized within his memory is the night his father brought back a gathering of extremely rare animals, and Bard's curiosity was piqued by a small albino half-beast locked in a cage. His father gave him a single warning that day: never let the creature touch him.\n\nMany years later, Bard is working diligently at his duties as the crown prince, striving to catch up to his great father. One day he comes across a small cabin—and the strange albino from his childhood dwelling within. Learning that the creature's name is Maya, Bard grows to care for the half-beast, bringing him presents and teaching him how to write.\n\nBut Maya is an omega, and when his heat strikes, will Bard be able to heed his father's warning?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
