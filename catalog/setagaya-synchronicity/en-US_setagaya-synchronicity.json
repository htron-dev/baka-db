    "sinopse": "Takafumi often sees \"him,\" a man that is just his type, at his part-time job. Always in the same seat, always studying, Takafumi couldn't help but notice him. When Takafumi moves into his friend's dorm room, he discovers his new roommate is \"him,\" a college student named Fukumachi. Through a series of coincidences, Takafumi keeps crossing paths with Fukumachi and becomes more entangled with his life. This is...normal, right?\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
