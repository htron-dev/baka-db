## Sinopse

Takafumi often sees "him," a man that is just his type, at his part-time job. Always in the same seat, always studying, Takafumi couldn't help but notice him. When Takafumi moves into his friend's dorm room, he discovers his new roommate is "him," a college student named Fukumachi. Through a series of coincidences, Takafumi keeps crossing paths with Fukumachi and becomes more entangled with his life. This is...normal, right?
