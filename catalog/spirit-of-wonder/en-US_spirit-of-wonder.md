## Sinopse

China is a lovely young woman, the kind of beauty people write songs about or name stars after. She's as spectacular as 4th July fireworks and as striking as lightning, and Jim Floyd—the technical assistant to the crazed Professor Breckenridge—just got struck! In fact, he'd give China the moon if he could. Odd thing is, he can. So that's just what he intends to do.
