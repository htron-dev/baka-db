    "sinopse": "A collection of rather gothic short stories by Hagio in her early career days. The title story is about Lucas, who seems like any ordinary boy except for the fact that he has not accepted the death of his twin brother, Alois. Little by little, Alois's dark personality is developing a presence of its own and taking over Lucas' consciousness. (Source: Prisms)",
