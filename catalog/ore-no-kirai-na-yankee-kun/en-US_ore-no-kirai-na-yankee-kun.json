Always pretending to be the perfect student tires him out and he vents his frustration when alone. One day while venting in the boy's restroom, he didn't know Saotome saw this and took a video. Saotome later confronts Kaga about knowing his \"secret\". But what is Saotome really after?\n\n(Source: Mangago)",
