## Sinopse

Ayu, an energetic and cheerful girl who lives with her cousin and his family, falls for Chiharu, a new transfer student in her class. Chiharu's surly toughness can't stand up to Ayu's cute cheerfulness, but unexpected competition and ghosts from the past may prevent them from being together.
