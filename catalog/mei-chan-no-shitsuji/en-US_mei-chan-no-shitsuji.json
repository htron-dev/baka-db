When Mei's parents die in car accident, this butler, Rihito, reappears, wanting to take her to her grandfather. Mei's grandfather is very wealthy and Mei turns out to be the heiress to his fortune and is forced to transfer to St. Lucia Academy, so that she can become a proper lady. When Mei's childhood friend Kento hears about this, he decides to enroll in a butler school so that he can stay close to her. Mei-chan falls in love with Rihito, her butler. Does Rihito love her back? In the meantime Kento, who is in love with Mei-chan, also isn't planning to sit back and do nothing.\n\n(Source: JShoujo Scans)",
