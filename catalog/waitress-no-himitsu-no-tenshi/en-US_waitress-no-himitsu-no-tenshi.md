## Sinopse

You rejected me with cold words, so why did you show up after all this time?

Her marriage to the wealthy Marcus ended after only three years. Vanessa left his house in sadness, but she was suddenly struck with nausea. One year later, Vanessa is helping with her aunt's bakery. Vanessa's dream is to deliver her aunt's pastries all over the United States, so she wants to expand the business. One day, she receives an offer from an investor, who turns out to be her ex-husband, Marcus. She can't let him find out about her secret! Vanessa tries to turn his investment offer down, but then Marcus tells her a surprising truth!
