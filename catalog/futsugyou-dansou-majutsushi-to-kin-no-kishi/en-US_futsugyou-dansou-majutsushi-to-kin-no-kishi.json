    "sinopse": "Haruka never asked to be summoned to another world. Despite this, she is thrown into a foreign land, and with her aptitude for magic, she eventually enlists in the military. There, she disguises herself as a man for her own safety and is thrown onto the frontlines.\n\nIn the bloody ruins of a fort, Haruka saves Ricardo, a knight who has lost all purpose in his life. Even with his desire to die, Haruka refuses to give up on him. From this meeting onward, Ricardo pledges his loyalty to the young mage, unaware of both her origins and gender. It is a decision that changes Haruka's life forever.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
