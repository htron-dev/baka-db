    "sinopse": "In a land far, far away exists a tiny kingdom named Momonofu. It is ruled by the Momonofu family—that is, the king, the queen, and the prince. Well, the prince is actually a girl, but that is just a trivial detail. The princess' hobbies are eating snacks, collecting stuffed animals and dreaming of world domination. Enter Miyamoto, the faithful butler of princess Apricot, who's actually a super sadist and possesses superhuman butler powers. Together with various other companions they set out to conquer the world—or at least to mess up princess Apricot's daily life!\n\n(Source: Batoto)",
