## Sinopse

Shinobu has a huge problem, and he doesn't know what to do about it! He's tried everything from going to an all-boys school to staying away from the types of magazines his classmates like, but it's not helping as much as he'd hoped. One day, he gets so desperate, he almost falls into the hands of a female con artist... but Nao comes to his rescue! It turns out Nao just might be the key to saving Shinobu from himself... This is a love story between two close friends!
