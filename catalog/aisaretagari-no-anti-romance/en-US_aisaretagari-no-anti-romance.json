    "sinopse": "\"Does it matter if we're in love?\"\n\n\"If it feels good, then surely it's fine.\"\n\nNaoto Fujikawa, an astonishingly innocent young man, and Tokitani, who hasn't dated seriously after his past failures, are now dating! Due to their surprising outlooks on love, the two didn't get along at first. But as they kept dating, little by little, Naoto's uncomplicated fondness started making him happy...\n\n(Source: Kasakura Shuppansha, translated)",
