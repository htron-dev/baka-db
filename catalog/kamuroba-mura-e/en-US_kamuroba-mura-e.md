## Sinopse

Former bank clerk Takeharu thought he was strange when he moved to a remote village in Japan's northeastern Tohoku region after developing an inexplicable "money allergy." However, as he attempts to live a peaceful rural life without currency, Kamuroba village's bizarre characters draw him out of his shell in this increasingly surreal madcap comedy.
