## Sinopse

A collection of shorts revolving around one couple. Private Menu is about Shinya, a 19 year old boy, who meets Toru at cafe he works at. Toru is an escort, and so beautiful that Shinya immediately falls for him. Blind gives a glimpse into Toru's life before he met Shinya, and Immoral Lovesickness finishes up the tale of the two boys. Sensual Love and I'll Only Make Love to You are both separate one-shots.
