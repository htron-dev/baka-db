## Sinopse

Detective Tachibana knows an awful lot about food (specific kinds of curry, ramen, fried chicken, soba, etc.), and talking about it at great lengths has gained him the nickname "Meshibana." He's able to open up uncooperative people under questioning, simply by telling food-related stories or having in-depth discussions about specific restaurants or food. His constant food-talk can win him friends at work, but it may also rub some people the wrong way. It seems like everyone who talks with him ends up feeling hungry!
