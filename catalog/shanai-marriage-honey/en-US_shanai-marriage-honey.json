    "sinopse": "Manatsu Miura is a young office worker who finds himself in a quandary: His mother is suffering from ill-health, and he believes that getting married will be a good way to bring some cheer to her—and help her recovery. The only problem is he doesn't have a girlfriend. So he downloads a dating app and starts looking for potential partners.\n\nAnother of the app's users is Ami Haruta, a woman who has been struggling to get over her ex, and has resolved to dive headlong into a new relationship in order to forget her former flame. The two meet online and decide to get married in a hastily arranged ceremony, barely knowing anything about one another.\n\nBut there's a hitch: Little did they know, but they are actually workmates. And as they neglected to tell their co-workers that they were getting married, their relationship becomes an awkward secret. Little by little, they get to know each other—and start to discover that despite the unconventional nature of their marriage, true love might not be completely out of reach after all...\n\n(Source: Rakuten Viki)",
