## Sinopse

Hiroya Suzuki is a young boy of 13 who lives in Japan. His father was transferred to a subsidiary of his company in Paris, and takes his whole family with him - for them it is the beginning of a great adventure.
Along with the new language he'll have to learn, getting used to a totally different lifestyle could well be the greatest challenge.
(Translated from amazon.fr).
