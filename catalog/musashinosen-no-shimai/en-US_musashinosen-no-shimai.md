Midorikawa Ran, at the age of 24, has made her fortune off of the financial market and has since retired. She spends her days online in chat rooms and gaming, while her younger sister Hikaru, aka Pandora, takes care of the household duties. Ran is comfortable with her situation but Hikaru realizes that they can’t continue their lifestyle like this and decides to work at a maid café.
