## Sinopse

Life can be so wonderful, yet terrible. The young Umeno, bullied since she started high school, decides to put an end to her life, but her suicide attempt fails and she survives. In the hospital, fate seems to provide her a new beginning. She meets people who show her a different meaning of life, above all a boy her own age who has a terminal illness... Can hope germinate even in the coldest of winters?
