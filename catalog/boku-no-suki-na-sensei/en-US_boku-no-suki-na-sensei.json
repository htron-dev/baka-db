As he's running to school he sees someone ontop of a wall that warns him not to go through the main entrance. Without a second thought he blurted out three words, \"Please marry me!\" From the shock the person falls off the wall where Kenmoto Kazuki discovers he just proposed to a man. This man was not just any man, but Morikeoke Akitou his homeroom teacher!\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Karada no Yuuutsu",
