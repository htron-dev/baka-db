## Sinopse

Mari Kudoh and his partner Yoichi call themselves 'handymen'. If it needs doing, these guys'll get it done. That's about to change, though. Miyuki (Mari's little brother and Yoichi's lover) asks the two men for a favor: stop the groper who's been hassling his best friend, Yu Kaitoh. But when Mari lays eyes on the beautiful Yu, he falls for him. Seeing as the handymen's next job involves smearing pretty little Yu's reputation, that's definetly not a good thing.
