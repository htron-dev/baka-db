## Sinopse

Seventeen years after her own reincarnation, Adelaide hears that a dimensional traveler has suddenly arrived at the imperial palace. Just the jolt of excitement my boring life needed, she thought! Attending the debutante ball to meet this new Susanne, Adelaide ends up making a deal with the handsome duke Felix: become his "fake" fiancee so he can keep the gold-digging Susanne away from him! As Felix warms to his companion, can Adelaide win this battle for his heart?
