Just the jolt of excitement my boring life needed, she thought! Attending the debutante ball to meet this new Susanne, Adelaide ends up making a deal with the handsome duke Felix: become his \"fake\" fiancee so he can keep the gold-digging Susanne away from him! As Felix warms to his companion, can Adelaide win this battle for his heart?\n\n(Source: Tappytoon)",
