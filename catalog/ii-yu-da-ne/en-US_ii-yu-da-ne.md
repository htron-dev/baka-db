## Sinopse

The story is set in the Kumano Yu bathhouse in Tokyo's low-lying Shitamachi area. The bathhouse's owner, Kumagorou Kumano, is a gold prospector who travels around the world looking for mines, and his son stays behind with his grandfather to look after the bathhouse in his absence. One day, Kumagorou's Brazillian wife Maria arrives at the bathhouse. The son and grandfather are deeply moved by Maria's earnestness, and her beauty and brightness save the bathhouse from having to close.
