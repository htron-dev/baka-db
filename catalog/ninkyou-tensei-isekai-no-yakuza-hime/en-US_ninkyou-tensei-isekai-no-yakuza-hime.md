## Sinopse

Focuses on an old-fashioned yakuza member who made a career in the underworld. When he is caught in a trap and loses his life, he is reincarnated as a princess in a fantasy world. While now a beautiful girl, the yakuza still retains the values tempered from a life in a world without honor and humanity.
