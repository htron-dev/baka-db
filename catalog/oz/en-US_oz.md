## Sinopse

In a not too distant future, the world is confronted with a host of issues: pollution, resource depletion, population expansion, and so on. In response, the Japanese government developed sensory simulation capsules (“beds”) and successfully launched a virtual reality program — “Gaia.” Interestingly, the designers omitted the concept of pain from the program, and as a result, there are no such things as pain or death in this new virtual world.

On a day that started as any other, Oono Yuuri stumbles across a mysterious card, which sets off a chain of strange events that evolve into a tale of conflicting dreams, unlikely friendships, and reluctant vengeance.
