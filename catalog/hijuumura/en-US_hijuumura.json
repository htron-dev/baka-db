Due to bad reception, they can't understand what's been said, but only the words \"help\" and \"Hijuumura\" are clearly heard. Since the police isn't of any help, Takuya and Miki leave to rescue their friends, but soon find out that that was place not meant to be entered...\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
