## Sinopse

Takuya and Miki return to their hometown for a friend's wedding anniversary, but as they arrive, Takuya receives a call from their friends, whom they were unable to contact through the whole trip. Due to bad reception, they can't understand what's been said, but only the words "help" and "Hijuumura" are clearly heard. Since the police isn't of any help, Takuya and Miki leave to rescue their friends, but soon find out that that was place not meant to be entered...
