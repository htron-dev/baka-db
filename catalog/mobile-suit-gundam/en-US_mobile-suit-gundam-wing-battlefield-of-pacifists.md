## Sinopse

Summer AC 196, the Earth Sphere Unified Nation begins the long process of disarmament with Relena Darlian leading the preceedings. However, something troubles the Gundam pilots; rumors fly about Vulkanus, an OZ manufacturing plant, full of Mobile Dolls and lost somewhere in space. In the meantime, an organization called the Perfect Peace People is calling for even further measures of disarmament than even Relena herself. The Gundam pilots set out to find and destroy Vulkanus before anyone can get their hands on it and use it for their own purposes.
