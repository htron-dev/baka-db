    "sinopse": "The massive beam of light fired from Eldora's moon has completely shattered the BUILD DiVERS' conception of Gunpla Battle Nexus Online (GBN). This has forced Hiroto Kuga and his teammates to reevaluate their mission on Eldora now that they are faced with potentially very real consequences. Despite this, the BUILD DiVERS rejoin the fight against the One-Eyed to protect what they hold dear. In the battle that concerns the fate of both Earth and Eldora, sparks fly as Hiroto is forced to confront his past amidst the revelations of GBN's shocking secrets.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
