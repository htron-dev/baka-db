## Sinopse

25 years after the battle at Ambat, the war between the Federation and the Veigans keeps escalating with no end at sight as the Veigans rejected all offers for a peace treaty. Flit, now married and father of two is a commander of the Earth forces determined to win the war and decides that the time has come to his son Asemu to succeed him as the pilot for the Gundam, entrusting him with the AGE Device on his 17th birthday. On an attack on his city, Asemu pilots the Gundam AGE-1 hidden at the family's stable for the first time to repel the Veigan offensive.
