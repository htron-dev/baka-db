Some of these veterans heal with the aid of loved ones, and others choose to recover in isolation, reflecting on their losses and the friends no longer with them.\n\nIn this epilogue to the hardships of Kira Yamato and Athrun Zala, the heroes come to terms with their roles in the recent war and prepare for adventures yet to come.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
