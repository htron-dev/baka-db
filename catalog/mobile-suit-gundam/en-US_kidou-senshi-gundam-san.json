    "sinopse": "The manga is a parody of the original Mobile Suit Gundam and features most of its characters in 4-koma strips. In addition, there are several \"sub-stories\" featured, including Captain Zaku-san, which features anthropomorphic versions of the mobile suits from Mobile Suit Gundam, and Gundam Sousei, which dramatizes the story of the creation of the Gundam franchise and features Yoshiyuki Tomino as well as other staff and cast members.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
