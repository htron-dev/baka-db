## Sinopse

As Celestial Being begins their anti-war activities, Fereshte begins to move in with the group being led by Chall Acustica, an ex-veteran of Celestial Being who had ended her service as a Gundam Meister after getting scarred in an unknown accident. Under her wing is Fon Spaak, an 18-year old career criminal forced into Fereshte's service by using the GNY-004 Gundam Plutone as part of his "services" as a Meister pilot.
