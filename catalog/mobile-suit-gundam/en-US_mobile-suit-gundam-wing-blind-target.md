## Sinopse

After the events of Gundam Wing, peace still does not come easily. Small rebel factions slowly gain influence and power, and those that were wronged during the war creep out from the woodworks. Relena, a symbol of peace and a primary political figure in the post-war rebuilding efforts, is kidnapped. The five pilots must once again come together in order to protect their fragile peace while simultaneously wrestling with their own morals and motivations.
