## Sinopse

Several hundred years have passed since the fierce battles using Mobile Suits throughout the universe. After many wars, earthlings forgot how to make developments in their own civilization. Some humans moved to the moon. For a very, very long time, they dreamed about returning to earth. When Planet Earth regained its standard of living to that of the days of the Industrial Revolution, Diana Soler, the Queen of the Moon entered into negotiations with the head of Planet Earth so that the Moon Race could return. She also secretly dispatched a reconnaissance troop to check the environmental and living conditions on Planet Earth. Rolland Seac came to Earth as part of the troop. Almost drowned in a river, he was saved by two beautiful sisters, Kiel and Sosie. After the accident, he started working for a mine, owned by the father of these sisters. He soon gets used to living on Planet Earth.

Two years pass and the Moon Race who are becoming impatient with the slow negotiations takes action and forcefully tries to return to Earth. Flames engulf the streets. The "Turned 'A' Gundam" appears from the White Doll Ruins and Rolland finds himself riding it. He becomes the savior of Planet Earth. Rolland's struggle to avoid war between the Moon and Planet Earth begins.
