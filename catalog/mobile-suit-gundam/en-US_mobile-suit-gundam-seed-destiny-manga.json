    "sinopse": "C.E. 71: After the terrible battle of Yakin Due, an uneasy peace rests between the Earth Alliance and the Zaft Empire. But even as Cagalli and Athrun visit Chairman Durandal to cement the tentative cease-fire, Zaft terrorists plot with Neo Roanoke to drag both sides into all-out war. The plan: storm Zaft territory and steal several Gundam Mobile Suits. But that’s only the beginning. They’re also scheming to engineer a catastrophic event, one designed to drive the Earth down a bloody path. Now the crew of the Minerva must prevent disaster, as everything and everyone–including the love between Athrun and Cagalli–is thrown in mortal danger.\n\n(Source: Del Rey)",
