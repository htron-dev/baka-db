## Sinopse

The year is cosmic era 71. Outer space has been taken over by thieves and pirates, and danger lurks throughout the cool, dark depths of the galaxy. Lowe Gear, a brilliant junk-tech mechanic, discovers a top-secret Mobile Suit in the midst of space debris. This mysterious Gundam seems to have been at the top of everyone's shopping list -- and now everybody is after Lowe !

Gundam SEED ASTRAY R is an out-of-this-world sci-fi epic, featuring edgy, never-before-seen stories that are set in the immensely popular Gundam SEED universe.
