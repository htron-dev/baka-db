Mobile Suit Gundam 00: Aoi Kioku deals with Gundam Meister pilots' memories

The August issue (on sale on June 26) of Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Gundam Ace magazine has launched Mobile Suit Gundam 00: Aoi Kioku (Blue Memories), Tarō Shiguma's new manga series based on the Gundam 00 anime television series.

The magazine summarizes how the manga will deal with the lives of the Gundam Meister pilots by saying, "The present and the past…fiction and memories…the true selves of the boys will be revealed."

The first installment, "Memory: 1 Setsuna," covers the memories of the main protagonist Setsuna's early childhood.
