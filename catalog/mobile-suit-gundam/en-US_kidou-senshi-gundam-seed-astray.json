    "sinopse": "Whereas the main story of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED focuses on the struggles between the Earth Alliance, ZAFT, and Orb Union, the Astray series is focused on the three MBF-P0x mobile suit prototypes (however mainly on Lowe Guele) and their respective pilots and organizations, who mainly exist on the outskirts of the main SEED storyline. The MBF-P02 Astray Red Frame is piloted by Lowe Guele of the Junk Guild, and the MBF-P03 Astray Blue Frame is piloted by Gai Murakumo of the mercenary group Serpent Tail. The third Astray, MBF-P01 Astray Gold Frame, is piloted by the primary antagonist of the Astray story, Orb nobleman Rondo Ghina Sahaku, and later by his twin sister Rondo Mina Sahaku.",
