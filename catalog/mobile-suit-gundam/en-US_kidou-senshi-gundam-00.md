## Sinopse

2307 AD. The nations of the world are split into three major power blocs, each striving to further their own prestige and prosperity. Despite the precariousness of the situation, these groups of nations insist on playing a grand zero-sum game. To stand up against the state of the world, a private organization calling themselves Celestial Being declare that they will end all war on Earth...they will be armed with the Mobile weapon Gundam.
