## Sinopse

The year is 2307 A.D. Although fossil fuels have been depleted, humanity has obtained a new source of energy to replace them in the form of a large-scale solar power generation system based on three huge orbital elevators. However, the benefits of this system are available only to a handful of major powers and their allies.

The three orbital elevators belong to three superpower blocs. These are the Union, led by the United States of America; the Human Reform League, led by China, Russia, and India; and the AEU, led by Europe. These superpower blocs continue to play a grand zero-sum game for the sake of their own prestige and prosperity.

In this world of never-ending conflict, a private armed organization appears, dedicated to the elimination of war through armed force. Its name is Celestial Being, and it is in possession of "Gundam" mobile suits. With these Gundams, it begins armed intervention into all acts of war.
