    "sinopse": "Van Asiliaino, Danica McGuire, and her older brother, Ernest McGuire. The destiny of these three individuals with a connection stronger than family starts to change in a big way since the Zeon Forces invaded Earth during the One Year War. According to the author, Junichi Kamino, AOZ is the chronicle of their conflicts and growth. A story that draws a line of belief while seeking truth in a world without hope. It carries a message of finding hope by yourself in a closed society. Another Z Gundam sidestory, “Advance of Z: The Traitor to Destiny” was created with a new staff, new mecha, characters and setting establishment differing from that of \"Advance of Zeta: The Flag of Titans\".\n\n(Source: Gundam Wiki)",
