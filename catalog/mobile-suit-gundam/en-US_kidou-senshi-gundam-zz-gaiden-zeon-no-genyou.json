Commander Vearn Fixeth of the stationed troops is on guard, but the captain of the Indra, Phaeton Rah Algis, shows no intention of fighting. Phaeton enters into negotiations with Brigadoon's government to purchase the colony with a large sum of money, however during the process, the Federation Forces begin an armed occupation of the colony under the pretext they're hiding remnant Titans.
