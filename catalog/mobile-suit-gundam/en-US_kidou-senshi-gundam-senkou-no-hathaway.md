## Sinopse

In Hathaway's Flash Hathaway Noa, still haunted by his past actions (not to mention the spirit of deceased Newtype Quess Paraya), joins a terrorist organization called Mafty and adopts the false name "Mafty Navue Erin." The organization Mafty is fighting a terrorist campaign against the Earth Federation government, and they are eventually able to acquire the incredibly powerful prototype Ξ Gundam, which Hathaway becomes the pilot of. Using the Ξ Gundam Mafty attempts to attack a meeting of high-ranking Federation cabinet members in Adelaide, Australia to force them to vote down a provision which would strengthen the Federations already considerable powers.

As a point to note, this novel focuses on a version of events chronicled in creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's novelized form of Char's Counterattack, rather than his animated movie version, and as such, several discrepancies can be found between the animated work and this novel, making it more of a semi-canonical UC storyline, rather than 100% official canon.
