## Sinopse

The year is U.C. 0088. A lone Neo Zeon ship approaches the Side 1 colony Brigadoon. Commander Vearn Fixeth of the stationed troops is on guard, but the captain of the Indra, Phaeton Rah Algis, shows no intention of fighting. Phaeton enters into negotiations with Brigadoon's government to purchase the colony with a large sum of money, however during the process, the Federation Forces begin an armed occupation of the colony under the pretext they're hiding remnant Titans. Phaeton manages to negotiate with them and gets them to leave the colony, much to the delight of the citizens, thus successfully making them Neo Zeon supporters. The purpose, however, of the Federation's attack is to rescue the lover of a senior Federation official which Phaeton was holding hostage. However, Phaeton has other ambitions… ambitions to "catch the sun"…
