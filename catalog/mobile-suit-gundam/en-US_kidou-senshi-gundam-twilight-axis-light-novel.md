## Sinopse

U.C. 0096, the Earth Federation Forces felt a threat to the existence of "psycho frame" again after the incident surrounding "Laplace's Box." In order to approach that mystery, they dispatched an investigation team to the asteroid Axis drifting outside the Earth Sphere. Two civilians participate as members of the research group: Arlette Almage and Danton Hyleg. Both have pasts with government service to the Principality of Zeon and Neo Zeon as an engineer and test pilot. Having infiltrated Axis, the investigators come under attack inside a base where no one should be. Arlette and Dalton are confronted with by an incident they would never have imagined.
