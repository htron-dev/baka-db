## Sinopse

A collection of bittersweet tales of all the different shapes an unrequited love can come in. Why is it so difficult to confess your love? Why is it that another person can affect someone else so strongly? When a powerful man is fickle, he is allowed to be. But if a woman is unfaithful, she is called a tramp. Koi tells the realistic stories of six different women of different ages, and completely different outlooks on life.
