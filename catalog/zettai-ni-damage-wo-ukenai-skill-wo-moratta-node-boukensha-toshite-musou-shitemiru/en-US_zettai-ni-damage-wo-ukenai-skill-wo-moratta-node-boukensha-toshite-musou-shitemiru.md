## Sinopse

Haruto, who lived as an ordinary boy. At some point, a goddess bestowed upon him the "Absolute No Damage Skill." Haruto was still half suspicious, at that moment when he was still visiting a village, after meeting the two sister adventurers Lilith and Alice, their path began to change dramatically. Whether people or demons, he'll mow down his enemy as an adventurer!
