    "sinopse": "On a visit to a friend's school's festival, high-schooler Yoshikawa Yoshio meets a cute girl, Miyazaki Tomo, whose glasses make her even cuter. Yoshio, a quiet, glasses-wearing guy who's never had much luck with girls, is surprised when she seems just as taken with him!\n\nThe reason quickly becomes apparent. Apparently, Yoshio looks just like Tomo and her manga otaku friend's favorite character from the manga series that they obsess over. He uses his newfound \"coolness\" to convince Tomo to be his girlfriend, but how real can their relationship be if she spends every second they're together comparing him to a manga character?\n\n(Source: Mangaupdates)",
