## Sinopse

After falling in battle, the samurai Jin wishes to be reincarnated with an "invincible metal body"; thus he is reborn as a coffee vending machine in present-day Seoul. Each night, he continues his eternal battle with other samurai who have been reincarnated as otherwise mundane objects. But, one day, he meets Hemi, a girl who buys a drink from Jin's vending machine body. After many similar encounters, Jin realizes he has fallen in love with her. Will his love be able to reach Hemi?
