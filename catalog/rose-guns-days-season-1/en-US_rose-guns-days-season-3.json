Alan and Keith have returned from war to find Tokyo very different from the one of their memories. Both may be maintaining high spirits, but they struggle to find their reason to keep fighting for a better future without being held back by bitterness. Will Primavera hold the answer for Alan and Keith, as well as the Japanese people?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
