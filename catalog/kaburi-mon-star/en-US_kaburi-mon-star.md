## Sinopse

Kase Eitarō (加瀬　永太郎) starts working at the Kazuki Sky World (かづきスカイワールド) amusement park and dresses up as Birdon (バードン), one of the park's mascot characters. Little does he know that an alien, whose spaceship crashed in the town, is hiding in the dress, or that the alien would die if Kase were to take off his dress. Thus, he is forced to wear his duck costume for 24 hours a day!
