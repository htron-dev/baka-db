    "sinopse": "The protagonist is based on the author himself — a 35-year-old who worked odd jobs like substitute teacher and shiitake mushroom harvester before moving to Tokyo to become a manga creator in 2011. Unfortunately, his manga does not sell, and he is very bad with people. The manga essay describes his struggles in order to make friends.",
