Makaeru then throws Aoi into a tree trunk, transporting him to the Land of Frogs. He is found by Princess Mimori, Makaeru's sister, and together they go on a quest to find the missing pages of the Magic Book that can remove Aoi's curse. For you see, when Aoi gets wet, he turns into a frog, and when he is dry, he turns back into a human...\" (From T.H.E.M.)",
