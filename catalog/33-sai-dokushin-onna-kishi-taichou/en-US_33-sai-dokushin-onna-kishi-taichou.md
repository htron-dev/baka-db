## Sinopse

Knights are gallant figures, defenders of kingdoms, noble souls who would sacrifice themselves for their king and should be looked up as examples for all society. Or so they say. In a strange world where seemingly men are scarce, women are hungry, but not for food, and one certain sword may be mightier than the pussy, there is a brave captain-knight, respected by her peers and feared by her enemies.
