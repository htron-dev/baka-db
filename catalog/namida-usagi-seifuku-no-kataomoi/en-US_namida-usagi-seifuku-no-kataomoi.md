## Sinopse

The class is changing seats and Momoka got stuck sitting by Narumi, the weird kid in the class. He has long hair that covers his eyes, he doesn't talk much and when he does he is kind off scary, and a circle of rumors follows him everywhere he goes. But is Narumi really a weird boy? Or is he just misunderstood? what kind of pure love could result from this...?
