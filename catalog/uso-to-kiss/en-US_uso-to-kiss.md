## Sinopse

Even though they were separated as children, Haru recognizes his long lost brother Tatsuya in a heartbeat. So, when Tatsuya invites Haru out for a drink, Haru assumes that Tatsuya recognizes him as well, but it seems the amorous Tatsuya has a poor memory.

Can love overcome all? Will their love be broken by the emerging history between them? This thrilling drama tests the limits of true love and societies mores. (Source: DramaQueen)
