    "sinopse": "Society is divided into those that rule and those that are ruled. For his entire life, Kamitani Naoya has been the latter and has been attempting to claw his way up with little to no success. He catches the attention of a strange man named Tsukui and learns that there are real spirits in this world. In fact, the college that he attends is full of spirits that go back to the ancient Japan era. However, the spirits are not looking for friends, but a delicious meal. And Naoya is the main course!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
