## Sinopse

The time is 1939, year 14 of the Showa period. Single-handedly raised by a former geisha in the Yanagibashi district of Tokyo, Takechiyo Morimasa is an energetic, straight shooting 4th year intermediate school student who loves the big city life and his beautiful mother. However, due to a family death, he is suddenly forced to move to a very rural, backwards region of Japan in order to take over the Aoba family line. What awaits him there is a school full of extremely eccentric characters who operate as if they were still in the Edo period. It seems the only way he can save himself is to create a successful baseball team...??
