## Sinopse

A collection of one-shots from the manhwaga of You're So Cool. The title "HWA," as explained at the end of the first story, comes from two characters with very different personalities, but they complete each other like two halves of a complete whole: one with a fire deep inside of him and the other who's as soft as a flower. Other stories include: "Truth," "Uninvited," "BEAT," and "The Little Prince."
