## Sinopse

It's not easy to find partners for omegas and alphas. Omega Akihiro's family know this, and so they also know how lucky they are to be able to arrange a marriage for him with Reiya. He's an alpha, he lives nearby, he's the same age as Akihiro, and he's apparently a wonderful person.

Although their arrangement is initially one that neither of the boys are interested in, feelings change once they see other sides of each other.
