## Sinopse

Shouji was upset when Shimazu cancelled their appointment. Minami approached him and told Shouji that he knew that Shouji was having an affair with Shimazu. Shouji denied it and Minami asked Shouji to let him stay over at his house for the time being. With Minami stepping into his life, would Shouji finally let go of his tiring love with Shimazu and accept Minami?
