When he was about to give up on his dream, Kaito suddenly feels magic power. However, that was magic that makes people who meet his eyes fall in love with him, a \"charming magic!\" Being popular is fine and all, but is this kind of magic really alright!? An envious fantasy love comedy of dreams and magic—the luckiest harem academy life, begins!\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
