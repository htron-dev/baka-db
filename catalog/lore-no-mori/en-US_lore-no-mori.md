## Sinopse

The word "Lore" means rumors, urban legends. That is, stories spread by word of mouth. The only ones who can reach "The Forest of Lore," a site that collects these stories, are the invited and all who have anything to do with this mys-terious site are visited by misfortune. Eiko, after getting lost in the Forest of Lore, is now looking to see if there are any rumors about her school... Are they real, or are they fake?
