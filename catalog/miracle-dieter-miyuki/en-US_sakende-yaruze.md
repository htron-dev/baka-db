## Sinopse

When his seventeen year old son turns up on his doorstep, 33 year old voice actor Hisae Shino has to take work from boy's love radio dramas to make ends meet. However, father and son have a lot to learn about each other, and things get complicated when Shino's co-stars want to continue the romance out of the recording studio... Shino must find out what it means to be father, and most importantly, must never forget his policy: that when you need to shout, you shout out loud. (Source: ANN)
