    "sinopse": "Helen ESP is from the controversial author of Franken Fran and retains much of the same dark style, but takes a much brighter look on life and death thanks to the cheerfulness of the main character. In Helen ESP, we follow Takahara Helen, who lost her sight, hearing and speech in a terrible car accident. Now she lives with her Uncle and a helper dog named Victor... and she's awakening to her own gift.\n\n(Source: Snoopycool)",
