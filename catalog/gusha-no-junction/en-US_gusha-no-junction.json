In other words... you're that kind of guy, huh.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the summer break, what was written on the walls of a super elite school were Emiel's declaration of revenge. After that, a single girl became a sacrifice, but her death had absolutely no effect on the school. Six elite students, as well as some others, take on individual 'roles' to protect their daily life and the Breeding Club's 'detective' Juumoji begins searching for the true identity of the offender, Emiel, in order to avenge his under-classman, who was brutally massacred.",
