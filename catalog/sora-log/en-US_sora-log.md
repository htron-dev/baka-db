## Sinopse

Hikaru Minami is a charming airhead whose mind is often lost in the vast, star-filled night sky. Along with her friends, she is a dedicated member of the astronomy club. While observing shooting stars alone one night, she bumps into a tall boy with bleached hair and, in that moment, she hears the tinkling of a bell.

Minato Asou is notorious for regularly hanging out with bikers and gangsters, having a distant personality, and possessing a perplexing past spattered with violence and rumors. However, Hikaru chooses to judge him with her own heart, looking past the clouds of whispers wherein he conceals himself—and their unlikely friendship soon blooms into love.

Hikaru brings out Asou's sincere gentleness for the world to see, but she also reveals a long-kept secret bound to the soft sounds of a bell.
