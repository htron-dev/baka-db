## Sinopse

Tokyo is under seige by the terrorist organization known as Panther Claw, and the beautiful superheroine android known as Cutie Honey appears on the scene to take them on—but fails! For her own protection, Cutie Honey must join forces with government agent Natsuko Aki, and pose as student and teacher at St. Chapel Academy. But there is nowhere to hide from Panther Claw and its leader's evil machinations!
