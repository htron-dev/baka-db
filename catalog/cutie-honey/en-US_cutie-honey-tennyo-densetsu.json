    "sinopse": "The year is 2005. The police, unable to carry out their work, are asking for help from talented private investigators for the most complex and important work.\n\nAmong these are Seiji Hayami, who, with the help of her assistant Hisashi Hanyuu, will be involved in cases concerning strange apparitions of monstrous beings, which will eventually lead to a confrontation with the Panther Claw terrorist organization/religious sect, who worship the goddess Zora, under the command of the bestial Sister Jill.\n\nDefeating the organization seems impossible, but help is at hand from the android, Cutie Honey. Having seemingly traveled from the 70s to defeat Panther Claw, she resides with Seiko in the form of Hisashi.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
