## Sinopse

Akabane Yuuhi, a fifteen-year-old girl who aspires to become an actress. Well, her dream might soon come true. She has been accepted into 'Diamond Actors Academy,' a very prestigious school which trains young boys and girls to become actors. Many famous actors and actresses graduated from this school. So, of course, Yuuhi is excited. But, things start to get a bit weird. Just what is up with their teacher, Otome Kasumi? The acting is getting a tad too realistic to be considered acting. Things are getting really creepy. Is the school really what it seems? Or is there more to this school than meets the eye?
