## Sinopse

Seventeen-year-old Issei Gotoukuji is a person of absolute perfection. He has it all: wealth, talent, intelligence, and good looks to top it all off. One day, he suddenly has the urge to see something he has never shown any interest in before: a girl's panties. Though devoid of any actual sexual intention, he is ready to do anything it takes to see them. During his efforts, he also learns about things he has been long ignorant about regarding human relationships.
