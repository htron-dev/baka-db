Masamune's life continues as usual, but he still tries his best to make Sagiri leave her room.\n\nAside from being a high school student, Masamune is also a light novel author. Although they have worked together for three years, Masamune has never met his illustrator \"Eromanga-sensei.\" Through a chain of awkward events, he ultimately realizes that Eromanga-sensei has been his stepsister all along!\n\nEromanga-sensei follows the two step-siblings—who experience hardships as part of the light novel industry—and looks at their lives as Sagiri begins to reopen her heart to society.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
