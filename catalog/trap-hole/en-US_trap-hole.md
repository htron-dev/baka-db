## Sinopse

Twenty-nine-year-old Haruko's world collapses when her fiance suddenly tells her he's leaving her. Although encouraged by family and friends, who are kindly consoling, she still feels suffocated. Sensing her need to get away, Asano—a classmate from Tokyo—suggests that she comes to live in the city as well. Life for Haruko, who had hit rock-bottom, is about to restart!
