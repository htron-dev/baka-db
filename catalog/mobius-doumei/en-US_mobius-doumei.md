Matsuri Takanose a first year high school student. Her mother is the board chairman of the school, and Matsuri is under a LOT of pressure to be the perfect student. One day after a grueling meeting in her mother's office at school, Matsuri encounters two boys who treat her differently. One is Takemasa Andou-kun, a smart, quiet guy who is known for keeping to himself and not talking much. The other is Watanuki-kun. Kaguya Watanuki is a very cute, outgoing, athletic guy. He and Andou-kun are classmates, but they don't appear to be friends. Later Matsuri happens to find out about her favorite idol pop singer and those two's relationship... This sets up an interesting love triangle... (Source: Cinderella Story)
