## Sinopse

Mina's village life seems peaceful as ever, yet some changes in their environment begin to affect their daily life. One evening, Mina's family get food poisoning from eating polluted river fish. Later that evening, a heavy rainstorm hits the village, and water from the polluted river flows into the well. Having taken medicine with unboiled well water, the family's health condition worsens. Mina, having learnt the causes of her family's illness, decides to improve the village environment.
