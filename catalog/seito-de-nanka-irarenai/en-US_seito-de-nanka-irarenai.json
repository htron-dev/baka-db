    "sinopse": "Time for Plan B. Upon facing the reality that photography won't put food on her table, Tasaka Miki, a feisty, young college student, resigns herself to life as a junior high school art teacher, assuming she can clear the training. Adapting to this strange, new world is no small task, but something else troubles Miki... Where exactly has she seen her sly-eyed student Takase Masaki before...? Just as curiosity got the cat, Miki's inquisitive mind swings open the door to shocking discoveries of secret lives and unknown motives, all of which threaten her very future! Maybe it's time for Plan C!\n\n(Source: DMG)",
