## Sinopse

I don't quite get that they call me by tactless name, "vampir." She is all that I desire.

Louis, a vampir boy lived with the Kamuro family as a "brother-in-law" in a home of human being. He had hoped it would last forever, however, peaceful and pleasant days with his beloved sister, Harumu, suddenly collapse with an appearance of another vampir, Noah.
