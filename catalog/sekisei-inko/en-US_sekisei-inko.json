After being picked up from the hospital by a mysterious benefactor, he resumes school, and tries to piece together his memories of the incident. To make matters more confusing, his buried memories have manifested in the form of a surreal being, whose head is shaped like a crescent moon. Together, they set off to solve the mystery of Hiwako's murder.\n\n(Source: MU)",
