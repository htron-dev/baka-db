## Sinopse

Yajima met a gorgeous young man, Ryo, when he was investigating a case. He was mesmerized by Ryo’s eyes and got his badge stolen instead. Who is Ryo? What does he want? And who was the man living in Yajima’s heart? The tormenting memories are coming back again…Another excellent work from Oumi Shinano sensei! You’d definitely fell in love with this middle-aged cool uncle and the pretty boy!
