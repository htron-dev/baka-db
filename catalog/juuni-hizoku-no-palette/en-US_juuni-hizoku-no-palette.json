    "sinopse": "On the island of Opal live the world's most colorful birds. The birds have attracted a school for aspiring \"Palettes\" — wizards who have the ability to \"borrow\" color from one object and paint its qualities onto another. Young Cello has the potential to be a great Palette, but she just can't seem to control her power. As the end of freshman year approaches she's on the verge of failing, so she's going to need all the help her bird, Yoyo, can provide.\n\n(Source: CMX)",
