    "sinopse": "Juliette, a destitute seamstress living in nineteenth-century London, comes upon a man being attacked by ruffians in the dead of night. Instinct takes over, and she pelts them with potatoes to save the man. He is Sir Douglas Drury, a courtroom lawyer and a baronet. His mind in a haze, he calls out to her and plants a sweet, passionate kiss on her cheek. When he wakes up, though, he's forgotten all about the kiss and treats Juliette as his servant, but when Sir Douglas's mysterious assailant targets Juliette's life, she pretends to be Sir Douglas's lover and makes her debut in high society in search of the culprit!\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
