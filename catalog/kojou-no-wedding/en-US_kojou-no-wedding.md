## Sinopse

American multimillionaire Meryl has just one problem: until she turns twenty-seven or gets married, she can't use her father’s inheritance freely. Determined to get the money her friend needs, Meryl puts a wanted ad for a husband in the paper. She soon gets a response from Jarvis, a broke nobleman living in an old castle in the English countryside. Meryl immediately goes to his castle to meet him, but is coldly refused and told to go home. Despite this, there's genuine warmth behind his stubbornness that Meryl finds herself more and more drawn to.
