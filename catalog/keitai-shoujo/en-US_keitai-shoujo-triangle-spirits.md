## Sinopse

Chihiro is a second year high school student. He is a bit impatient since he's got no girlfriend even though he gets closer to Christmas. One day, while he is on the mobile phone internet, he finds an interesting web site and downloads it. When he finishes it, his phone suddenly flashes..., and a tiny girl appears in front of him. "I'm Rin. What's your name? You have no girlfriend, don't you? I'll be in trouble if I don't make you happy." She tells him that if he doesn't find a girlfriend before Christmas, she won't be able to go back to her world. Will he be able to find a girlfriend before Christmas for himself and Rin...?
