One day, while he is on the mobile phone internet, he finds an interesting web site and downloads it. When he finishes it, his phone suddenly flashes..., and a tiny girl appears in front of him. \"I'm Rin. What's your name? You have no girlfriend, don't you? I'll be in trouble if I don't make you happy.\" She tells him that if he doesn't find a girlfriend before Christmas, she won't be able to go back to her world. Will he be able to find a girlfriend before Christmas for himself and Rin...?\n\n(Source: Himeya Shop)",
