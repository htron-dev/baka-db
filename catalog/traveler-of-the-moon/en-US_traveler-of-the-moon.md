## Sinopse

When most girls ask their parents for a pet they’ll get either a cat or a dog. In Yuh-ur’s case, she ended up with a bat and that’s not the end of it. Not only did she get a bat for a pet, it turns out that Dori, her pet bat, is actually a vampire! Well, at least he turned out to be cute and funny~! (Source: Infinity Studios)
