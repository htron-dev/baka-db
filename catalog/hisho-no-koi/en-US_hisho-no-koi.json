They're good at keeping things private... like the passionate love affair they've been sharing for eight long years! But even after so many years together, challenges keep popping up to test their love—like the new guy who dares to come between them! Add to that a director who's always keeping them on their toes. And even these veteran lovers will need all the help they can get to overcome the obstacles that hound them!",
