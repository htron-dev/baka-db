    "sinopse": "Raul who had defeated the demon king as the strongest hero should have become the savior of the world.\n\nHaving his treasured companions and family killed by power hungry aristocrats, he was executed with false charges brought against him by the princess. Just before his life ended, at last his heart fell into pieces...and after obtaining the power of darkness, Raul was revived.\n\nSeveral days after the hero's revival in the imperial capital where flowers bloomed in profusion, the parade that would advance towards tragedy began.\n\n(Source: Shueisha, translated)",
