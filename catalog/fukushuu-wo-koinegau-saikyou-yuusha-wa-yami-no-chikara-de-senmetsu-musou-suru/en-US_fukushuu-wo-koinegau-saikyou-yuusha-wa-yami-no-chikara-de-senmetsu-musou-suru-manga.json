    "sinopse": "The foolish are conquered, and the kind are used—this is a universal truth that the hero Raul finally learns, with pain coursing through his veins and hands tied to a cross. Betrayed by the very humans he swore to protect, as fire consumes him and he takes his last breath, he swears vengeance against those who wronged him.\n\nBut even death offers no respite, and Raul is granted another chance at life with his power unsealed. All of the humans in the world are vile beings. From the sadistic princess who slaughtered those he held dear, to the soldiers who carried out her orders in glee, no one is exempt from Raul's path of carnage.\n\nAn eye for an eye, Raul sets out to deliver his own form of divine retribution. For every inch of suffering inflicted on him and his loved ones, Raul will make them suffer tenfold. And so, no matter what it takes, he will have his revenge.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
