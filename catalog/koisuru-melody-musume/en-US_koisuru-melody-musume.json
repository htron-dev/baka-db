    "sinopse": "Several romance stories, this time featuring high-school aged heroines.\n\nSTORY 01: DJ \"COOL\"\nChiaki never expected to fall in love with the number one night club DJ!\n\nSTORY 02: Pianist \"Sou\"\nMizue is charmed by her enigmatic music professor.\n\nSTORY 03: Guitarist \"Demi\"\nHinano's boyfriend just dumped her because she's not his type! She's too cute, and he wants a sexy girl... but it would seem Hinano's mailman disagrees. By day, he hand delivers her mail, and by night he lets down his bleached blonde hair, and... (!!!) -- but guys like that aren't Hinano's type!\n\nSTORY 04: Princess Hungry\nAoi, age 17, has a problem -- an abnormal appetite! It's getting hard to keep it a secret from her classmates, but she can't let them know. She still remembers when she started dating her crush Kousaka... and then when he caught her pigging out after they'd parted one night, he never spoke to her again. But now Aoi is going on a trip with some classmates and their friends... and Kousaka is with them!? Is he mad at Aoi? Will he tell everyone her secret??\n\nAt the end there is an omake about getting a cat door.\nThe original Hakusensha cover features the school girl who has a relationship with the music teacher, while the newer Kadokawa version uses a picture of the cutesy girl (looking very loli-goth) with her rock musician boyfriend.",
