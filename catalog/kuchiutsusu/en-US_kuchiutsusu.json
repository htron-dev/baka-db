    "sinopse": "Yuka, a novelist specialising in platonic love stories, received a request to write a sexual love story. Despite being unfamiliar with this genre, the words from her mouth started flowing naturally when Hasegawa, a dentist, began dictating her story in response to her injured hands. Yuka eventually becomes confused of her own emotions towards Hasegawa—was she enjoying the pleasure of creating a story with Hasegawa or was it the beginning of a new love story between the two?\n\n[Written by Sun]",
