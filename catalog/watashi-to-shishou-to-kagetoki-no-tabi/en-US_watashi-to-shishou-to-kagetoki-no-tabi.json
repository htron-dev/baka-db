    "sinopse": "Alicia, a live-in apprentice of sorcery, wants to follow the footsteps of her Master—Kyle. Alicia is frustrated that she cannot seem to remain mad at Kyle even though he acts like a womanizer. Whenever she tries to get mad at him, he makes sweet talks about her like how precious an apprentice she is to him and thereby making her to give up.\n\nJust like that when yet another ordinary day seems to have resumed, something sinister happens. Kyle opens a letter which turns him into Alicia's shadow! Kyle realizes he has been cursed by the witch who he once turned down. To make matters worse, Jinno and Shuu, two envoys from the Royal Palace, show up to collect a magic item Kyle was due to deliver but had not. As Kyle hides in Alicia's shadows to avoid meeting the two envoys, Jinno gets his hand on the cursed letter and no sooner had he started reading it, he is turned into a shadow as well...into Shuu's shadow!\n\nNow the four of them must embark on a journey to reverse the curse! Let the wonderful journey begin!",
