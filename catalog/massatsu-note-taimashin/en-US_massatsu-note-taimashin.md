## Sinopse

With a strange plague of demonic possession slowly taking over the bodies of unsuspecting victims, there's only one man to call—the acupuncturist, Dr. Taima. His knowledge of the obscure ability to wield the tamaishin—needles, not only used to banish malevolent and lecherous demons, but also that can control the flow of chi in all things—makes him a force to be reckoned with!

Having found its way to Dunwich. Massachusetts, Dr. Taima and his lovely assistant, Maki Togetsu, make their way to America to combat this repulsive plague that turns people into rapacious monsters that devour anything within their grasp! When an ally joins dr. Taima, how will these taimashin masters bait their prey into their piercing trap? Find out in the story that chronicles their campaign against evil, in Taimashin!
