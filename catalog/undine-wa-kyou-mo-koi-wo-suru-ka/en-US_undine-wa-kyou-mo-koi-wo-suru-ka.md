## Sinopse

In a desert world where rain doesn't fall, the only source of water for the country of Rahasa is a girl named Aclea, who has the power to generate water from her body. Asha is a boy who's in charge of water conservation, and is always scolding Aclea for overdoing it when there isn't enough water. But after a series of misunderstandings, it's discovered that Aclea is in love with Asha, and she makes large amounts of water whenever he makes her heart race! With Aclea none the wiser, Asha's life is turned upside down as he's roped into the task of romancing her in order to save Rahasa from eternal drought.
