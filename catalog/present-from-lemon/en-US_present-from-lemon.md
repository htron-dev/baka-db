## Sinopse

Young Lemon Sawaguchi has a gift for music: whoever listens to him can't help to be carried away by his marvellous ringing voice.
Lemon's only ambition is to realize the dreams of his father, who died before he could start his career as a professional singer.
Which won't be an easy task...
