Kyouka, a 16 year old, will be a winner today, the first day of the new school she transferred to! She will definitely get a great boyfriend and say her goodbyes to those lonely days!! Kyouka has two brothers who love her a lot. Every guy who comes close to Kyouka will be kicked out by them, thus she has no boyfriend.
