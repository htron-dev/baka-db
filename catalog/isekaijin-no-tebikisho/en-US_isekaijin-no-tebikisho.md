## Sinopse

The main character is suddenly summoned to another world…..and the one who shows up next is a malicious and scheming noble…..obey or die. I’ll try to rise in this world and live on by any means! It’s the story of such a hero.

Comedy and serious scenes? I’m the type that won’t let his guard down even when my magical powers are at a cheat level…… I take my medicine while scheming wickedly.

Was I only scared of my surroundings in the beginning? Well, I’ll do my best to become an indispensable hero!
