    "sinopse": "1941, Japan. Kuramoto Soutaro, the heir to the wealthy Kuramoto family, has returned from living overseas to the country of his childhood, wishing desperately to reconcile with his adored yet estranged childhood friend, Asuma Haruomi, the heir to a family of onnagata in the pleasure district of Tokyo, who has grown into a dancer of beauty and reknown during the years of their separation. Driven by the desire to see Haruomi’s dancing once more, and to finally apologize to him, Soutaro conceals his identity and takes work as a servant at the exclusive restaurant Tachibana, where Haruomi occasionally dances.\n\n(Source: Hero Scans)",
