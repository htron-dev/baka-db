    "sinopse": "With excellent grades and a diligent attitude, Hinana Hanazawa presents herself as a serious and sensible girl. Little do her classmates know, she dreams of a fairy-tale romance, with a dashing prince to sweep her off her feet. While her head may be in the clouds at times, she is well aware that the likelihood of this fantasy becoming reality is next to none.\n\nJust like in a storybook, however, Hinana's prince charming does arrive; Kaede Ayase, a wildly popular actor and model, comes to her school to shoot his next big feature film. Kaede is also putting on a front for the public—while polite and considerate around most, privately he is much more laidback and has a secret butt fetish. After meeting, the two feel an instant connection, and eventually they begin seeing each other more often. Faced with media scrutiny, old flames, and past regrets, can a hopeless romantic and a somewhat perverted superstar keep their love alive?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
