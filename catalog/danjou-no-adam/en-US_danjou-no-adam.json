Then, she catches him again later, kissing another teacher in her classroom! What is up with this crazy teacher! To make things worse, he turns out to be her new next-door neighbor as well! Mia can't escape him, and even a possible romance with her classmate Hayama-kun can't distract Mia from the problem of Kataoka-sensei.",
