## Sinopse

High school girl Mia's dreams of perfect attendance are thrown in to jeopardy when she encounters Katakoka-sensei, her new teacher, kissing someone in the hallway of her school. Then, she catches him again later, kissing another teacher in her classroom! What is up with this crazy teacher! To make things worse, he turns out to be her new next-door neighbor as well! Mia can't escape him, and even a possible romance with her classmate Hayama-kun can't distract Mia from the problem of Kataoka-sensei.
