## Sinopse

With a romantic, supernatural story as good as any TV show, and fabulous, exciting, sensual art by Battle Arena Toshinden artist Takeshi Takebayashi, it’s got everything—romance, action, adventure, and beautiful girls!

This great graphic novel tells the story of the love triangle of Yuichiro, a handsome teen, who finds himself swept away by the new student, mysterious blonde Shion, even as he tries to remain true his beautiful brunette girlfriend, Maki. When, while on a student cruise, they’re suddenly shipwrecked by a godlike supernatural, and Shion is revealed to be a charmed one herself!
