    "sinopse": "Once before Seven mythical Gods appeared on Earth and their battle split the earth, tore the sky. 10 years after the battle, the calamity should have gone already. However, a boy named Shinsen Raika had his true little sister abducted by a god in the battle and was currently standing in the \"Academy\" on an artificial island in the distant seas.\n\nHere, the night was called as after school time. During that time period, the \"Gods' Proxy Wars\" were being held by using Divinity-Compatible people for gaining the seat of the law of world (The supreme God).\n\nOn the first night, Raika was attacked by a Norse mythological God, Brynhildr. Facing death in front of himself he acquired the detestable power of gods, the power for revenge. Using Absolute Domination power from the devil eye of Balor, he tries to take back the world from Gods control.\n\nA new mythical heroic saga of a devil eye-user person swearing to take revenge on Gods begins now!",
