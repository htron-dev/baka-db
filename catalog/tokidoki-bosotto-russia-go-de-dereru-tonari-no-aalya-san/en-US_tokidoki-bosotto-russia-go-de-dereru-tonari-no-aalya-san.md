## Sinopse

"И на меня тоже обрати внимание."

"What did you say?"

"Nothing special. All I said was 'This guy is really stupid.'"

"Could you stop insulting me in Russian!?"

Aalya, a beautiful silver-haired Russian girl who sits next to Masachika, had a triumphant smile on her face. However, the reality of the situation was different. What she really said in Russian was "Pay attention to me!" In fact, Masachika can actually understand Russian. However, Aalya has no idea that he can understand her. Today once more, she tells him sweet words in Russian, and Masachika simply cannot stop grinning to himself.

A youthful romantic comedy with a Russian JK that everyone would adore!
