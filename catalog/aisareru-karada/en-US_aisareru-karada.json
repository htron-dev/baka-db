He’s the guy he has been idolizing in some body-building poster. There is another story in this manga entitled Taberarechau. A bit incest, Yuu moved in with his relatives because his parents moved south for their jobs. A friend warned him about Hiromi (his cousin, I guess?) who seems to be going out with a guy.\n\nIncluded oneshot: Taberarechau!\nYuu moved in with his relatives because his parents moved south for their jobs.
