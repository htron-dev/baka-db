## Sinopse

Shin Gyu Yun is the heir of the Shin Oong Group and the self-proclaimed prince of Korea's economy. However, he has a secret. Since his father left them before Shin was born, he can't help but clean things due to his past of helping out his mother with the chores. It wasn't until that Shin's mother died in an accident that he came to know his scheming step-sisters by moving into his father's estate. The step-sisters conspire to make him lose his position... but could that have made him fall in love with a low-class girl?
