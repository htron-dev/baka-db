## Sinopse

Lindy can't believe she ended up sleeping with Shane, her boss! She's his personal secretary and last night was his birthday party—in a drunken state, he opened up to her about his crippling feelings of loneliness and isolation, and she fell for him hard. But this morning, after she ran out of his bedroom and awkwardly ran into him again at work, Shane comes to her with a most perplexing request: he wants her to find the woman he just slept with! He doesn't seem to remember a thing!
