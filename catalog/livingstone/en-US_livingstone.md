## Sinopse

Each person is born with a soul, its plan determining ninety percent of one's life. People who stray from their soul's fate, whether it be through an unfortunate accident or an unplanned murder, leave behind a shattered "psycholith"—a rock that is a manifestation of their soul. When these are left behind, they stain the environment, ultimately creating "negative points"—places that interfere with a soul's plan, causing a vicious cycle of misfortune.

The righteous Sakurai and apathetic Amano are a pair of specialists tasked with ensuring that souls follow their natural paths. To that end, as part of Psycholith Collection & Cleaning, they collect and dispose of shattered psycholiths and clean up stains. But there is another side to their job, one with moral ambiguity. They must also prevent psycholiths from shattering—even if that entails killing the soul's host.
