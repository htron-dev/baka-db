## Sinopse

KOOLS is a collection of three one-shot stories.

The first story, "KOOLS," which stands for "Kiss Only One Lady," is the story of Sae, who slowly, but steadily comes to grips with the fact that she is lesbian.

In the second story, a party girl is gang raped, but does not report it, because she is sure that no one will believe her or that they will make it out to be her fault.

The last story is set in high school, where a nice girl is going out with the hunky guy - who beats her. The story covers all the ways women lie about their abusers, to themselves and to other people.
