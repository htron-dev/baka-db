    "sinopse": "Chiaki Inukai is a popular and handsome high school senior who would rather laze around in female company than do anything productive. His reputation concerns second-year Anna Sarutani, who must work together with him on the Cultural Festival Executive Committee. Surprisingly, Chiaki does not turn out to be as useless as she had feared. He credits his unwavering, overwhelming self-confidence as the reason why others listen to what he says. And with the same sense of assurance, he predicts that it won't be long before Anna falls in love with him. Will events exactly unfold as Chiaki says?\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shot: Monochrome Lens",
