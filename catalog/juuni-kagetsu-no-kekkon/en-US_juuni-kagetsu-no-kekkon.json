Her sister has been promised to Vidal Marquez, who is both an old childhood friends as well as Spain's foremost authority in banking. However, Reina has broken off her engagement and disappeared! Theirs wouldn't have been a marriage of love; the purpose of the marriage was to get Vidal to give his assistance to the bank her parents own. Now that Reina has vanished, Elena gets offered up as a sacrifice after being in the wrong place at the wrong time! Elena has been aware of Vidal's arrogance and coldheartedness ever since they were children. How can she ever marry a man like him?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
