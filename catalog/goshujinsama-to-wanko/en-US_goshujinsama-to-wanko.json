    "sinopse": "University student, Uehara Yuuji, is an earnest guy with slight masochistic tendencies and he happens to be totally in love with the cold, glasses-wearing Tatsukawa-sensei.\n\nEver since he first spotted the Sensei, he’s confessed his feelings time and time again only to have the antisocial Tatsukawa-sensei refuse every time.\n\n“That’s it! If I’m not human, he’ll fall in love with me!”\n\nSensei then orders the dog cosplaying Yuuji to do what?\n\nIn addition to this story, Goshujinsama to Wanko overflows with love and sex! An ample collection of full fanservice from Sakira!\n\n(Source: Blissful Sin)",
