    "sinopse": "While at work one day, Fujisawa cut his finger deeply, and ran to a crowded medical clinic. By chance, he met, for the second time, his childhood friend Kenjou, who was now a doctor at the clinic. Fujisawa still remembers being a junior high school student, and the time in the library when he had softly kissed his sleeping friend, the object of his unrequited love.\n\n(Source: MU)",
