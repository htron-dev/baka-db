## Sinopse

Set in the distant future where Mankind is just a memory of "the Gods" and the earth is populated by angelic creatures with wings. The princess Mimia never developed her wings and can't use magic, just like the Gods. Called a "child of the Gods," she must go on a journey to unite with them and leave her people. This is the story of that journey.

Tanaka Yutaka dives into the magical world of Princess Mimia more fully as he details her travels and encounters. Unlike a lot of Tanaka's other works, this is not ero or even sexy at all.
