Driven by madness and revenge, one day he hears of \"Kelg's pub\", a place where heroes who were reincarnated into this world go to search for companions in their quest to defeat the demon king.\n\nWanting to be chosen by one of these heroes, Urus makes his way to this pub but... There he is labeled as the weakest class by a strange summoning ritual and branded with the mysterious letter \"R\". It is here that he comes into contact with the true darkness of this world.\n\nWhat is \"R\"? What is this ritual!? And what is the darkness of this world!?\n\n(Source: Takeshobo, translated)",
