## Sinopse

The era of Toyotoshi clan rule has ended, bringing about a period of lasting peace governed by the Tokugawa clan. There is no longer a place for the gigantic war machines known as automaton armors to wage combat except for a young upstart by the name of Akatsuki takes the black automaton armor Kougetsu to extract revenge on his foes. In events unrelated to this, Shiori Kuchiha, the war god of the Shogunate, travels to the distant Aki Province to investigate a string of unexplained disappearances.

They find themselves drawn together by common fate with a mysterious girl named Sagiri and their meeting sets into motion events that threaten the country!

Prepare yourself for a Warring States (Civil War) epic that fuses steel juggernauts with elemental magic!
