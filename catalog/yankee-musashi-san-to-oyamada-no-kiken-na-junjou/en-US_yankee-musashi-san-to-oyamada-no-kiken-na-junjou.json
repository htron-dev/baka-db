Ever since Musashi saved him from a group of bullies, Oyamada hasn't been able to keep Musashi's broad back out of his mind. Having entered the same high school as him, Oyamada persistently tries to become Musashi's pupil. One day, he decides to follow Musashi after school to learn his secrets... as a house-husband?!\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
