    "sinopse": "Touno's heart is still on the mend after an upsetting break-up with another physician. The last thing he needs is the bratty son of the hospital's big-wig telling him what to do! But will Touno let his guard down before a sweet, special moment passes him by?\n\nA Waltz in the Clinic swings and sways in time to the seductive rhythm of surprise romance! Can a patient's dark secret be the key to healing the deepest of wounds? And will temptation take root and become real-life love?\n\n(Source: Juné)",
