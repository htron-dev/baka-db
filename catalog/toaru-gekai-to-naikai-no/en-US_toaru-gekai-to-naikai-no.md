## Sinopse

Physician Misawa harbors an unrequited love for his friend and colleague Kazami, a surgeon. There's only one problem: Kazami is a known ladykiller. Misawa vows never to let Kazami know how he really feels until he meets Touno, an intern who can see right through him. Soon it's revealed that Kazami has a secret of his own. Where will this triangle lead and when will they ever find the time for love in their busy schedules?
