## Sinopse

Behind the scenes of the “Hero” and “Devil” that everyone knows well, there was a swirl of strategies to maintain a balanced power relationship with each other!

500 years since the last battle of "Hero" vs. "Devil," the Helenes Kingdom, faced with population growth and food shortages, decided to cultivate territory in the buffer zone “ambiguous navel.” As a result, the balance that has been maintained begins to collapse.
