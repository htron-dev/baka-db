    "sinopse": "Yuriko is the young female CEO of an apparel brand. Due to the nature of her position at work, she pretends to be a celebrity playgirl even though she is an earnest woman wholly dedicated to her job. In reality, she has zero experience with dating, but this is something she definitely cannot allow others to find out especially that guy.\n\nShibuya is the CEO of a nearby high-end brand. Though Yuriko definitely considers him her rival, he, frustratingly, does have better skills than her. One day, he catches her by surprise when he proposes they play a little game! Teasing her innocent breast and sweet spots has her screaming, \"No more... my body's going to go crazy...!\" But ever since their little game, Shibuya hasn't been himself?\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)",
