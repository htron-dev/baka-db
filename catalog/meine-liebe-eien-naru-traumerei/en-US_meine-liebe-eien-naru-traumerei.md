## Sinopse

Erika Klause entered Rosenstolz Academy in hope of finding her brother who was separated from her when they were still children. She had forgotten what he looked like, and the only clue leading to him is a piece of ribbon which they had agreed to meet with. Upon entering the school, what welcomed her were 3 new girl friends, the five Strahl (king's scholars) candidates, and a ton of rumor-making classmates. What possibly could go wrong at looking for a brother? And how will Erika's relationship with Orpherus, Eduard, Naoji, Ludwig and Camus turn out, now that she was chosen as one of the Strahl secretaries?
