    "sinopse": "The police officer Shigemitsu Hashiba is a funny man. He never seems to take anything seriously. But this attitude is just a mask that prevents him from being truly known by others.\n\nAll this will change when he is assigned as a partner to Keiji Sasaki, a diligent and too serious rookie.\n\nThe two form a perfect combination and their goal is to arrest Mr Sawada.",
