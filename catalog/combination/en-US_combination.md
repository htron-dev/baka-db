## Sinopse

The police officer Shigemitsu Hashiba is a funny man. He never seems to take anything seriously. But this attitude is just a mask that prevents him from being truly known by others.

All this will change when he is assigned as a partner to Keiji Sasaki, a diligent and too serious rookie.

The two form a perfect combination and their goal is to arrest Mr Sawada.
