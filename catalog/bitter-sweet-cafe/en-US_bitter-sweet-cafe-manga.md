## Sinopse

One day, Katsuragi Megumi, a café manager, came across a deeply wounded patissier, Honda Yuuji. Since then, Honda has helped out at Megumi's café. Even though Megumi is much older and a bit clumsy, his cuteness truly touched Honda. One night, Honda sees Megumi screaming some man's name while masturbating. Seeing such an obscene Megumi, Honda realizes that he actually loves Megumi.
