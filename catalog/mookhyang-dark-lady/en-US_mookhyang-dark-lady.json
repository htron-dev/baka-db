    "sinopse": "The exceptional martial artist and proud hierarch of the Demonic Sect, Mookhyang, winds up in a strange new fantasy realm after falling victim to a curse cast by his enemies, the Blood Sect. But when Mookhyang's incredible control over qi, or mana, becomes known, it's only a matter of time before he gets cursed again... and turned into a young lady?! In this world of elves, mages, knights, and dragons, will a mastery of Chinese martial arts be enough for one man (or woman) to fight his way back home? Or will this humbled warrior finally concede defeat?\n\n(Source: Tappytoon)",
