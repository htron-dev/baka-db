## Sinopse

Tsubaki Sadamitsu is a young punk and Leader of the Corpse Gang who, after a chance encounter with an alien robot, is forced to take up the task of capturing rukeitai (intergalactic criminals). His job is made harder with the appearance of the Vulture, a last ditch effort to keep the rukeitai under control.
