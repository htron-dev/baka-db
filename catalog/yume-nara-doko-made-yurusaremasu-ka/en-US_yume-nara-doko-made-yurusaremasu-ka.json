    "sinopse": "\"I've killed someone, please arrest me!\"\n\n...is what he said as he rushed into the police station, but it was all just a dream. 27-year-old Kaga Mitsuki has just done something unspeakably embarrassing. Later, Kaga goes to the police station to apologize and is greeted by Seto Kenya, a young police officer who is kind and has great taste. Moreover, Seto tells Kaga, \"If you have another nightmare and feel anxious, please come see me!\" and they become closer and closer friends... At this rate, Kaga won't be able to resist falling for Seto! From then on, Kaga's nightmares turn into erotic dreams of Seto... An erotic and heart-wrenching romantic comedy BL featuring a young, dog-like police officer and a corporate slave!\n\n(Source: Sankosha, translated)",
