## Sinopse

Nagasaka Naohito works at a meat processing plant, and treats the food there as nothing more than a product to be sold. When he's hit by a truck, he's sent to a fantasy world filled with monsters. Now at the bottom of the food chain and on the verge of starving to death, he's saved by a mysterious girl, and receives the power to make any monster he touches into his ally.
