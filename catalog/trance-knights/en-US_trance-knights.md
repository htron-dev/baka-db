## Sinopse

The world is completely changed when “Sacred King”, the military satellite created by the scientist Arthur, loses control. Arthur’s personal army, the “Trance Knights” have broken up, and other organisations are attempting to take control of the satellite. In the midst of these events, Arthur’s daughter Ley, who holds the key to the “Sacred King” encounters Gawain, one of Arthur’s former knights.
