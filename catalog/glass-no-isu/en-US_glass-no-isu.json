    "sinopse": "\"Being a carpenter is about perfection,\" young boy Izuru told his little sister while making her a chair. The chair is indeed a perfection in Aoi's heart. Just like her brother, she too wanted to become the best carpenter, and while to her disappointment her brother chose another direction of life after he graduated from highschool, grown-up Aoi is now a carpenter who makes the best, perfect chairs.\n\nFor some reasons Izuru over the years has detached himself from Aoi, and there's nothing Aoi could do about it. But it doesn't stop her from wanting to be close again to her brother like they used to, especially when now there's a mystery and danger looming over her beloved family...\n\n(Source: M-U)",
