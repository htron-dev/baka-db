## Sinopse

Azalea's geography home tutor, Edgar, have left for a place named Touran, a place where eastern and western cultures, thoughts and ideas come together as one... And one day, Azalea received a letter, inviting her to visit him in Touran. Once there, she was thrown into a state of confusion. How did Edgar send her a letter when he have died last year? And why does she keep seeing this black-haired man everywhere?

"The only thing I can be sure of... is that the name that this man is calling— is certainly mine."
