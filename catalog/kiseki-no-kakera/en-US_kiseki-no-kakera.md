## Sinopse

"Find a fraction of a miracle". These were the words that remained in Keiko's ear as her second mother passed away. But those words actually were meant for her biological son, Kaoru, not Keiko. To pass along the message and to find out what it meant, Keiko seeks out Kaoru, but...!?

Included in this manga volume are two other one-shots named "Yuuyake Drops" and "Time Table".
