## Sinopse

In Tokyo lies a small restaurant called "Western Cuisine Nekoya," ordinary in every way―save one. Every Saturday, its door connects to another world! Follow along as a cavalcade of curious guests from half-elves to samurais, dragons, halflings and vampires enter its premises, all with the same goal in mind: to fill their stomachs with the most mouth-watering of foods.
