    "sinopse": "A young man, Gyeon-woo, recounts how he meets and develops a relationship with a very \"sassy\" girl who is recovering from the recent death of her fiancee. Due to her inability to entirely overcome her loss, she keeps him at arm's length, more than just a friend, but less than a boyfriend. Despite this, Gyeon-woo stays by her side, determined to help heal her pain. Gyeon-woo's story is told through his online blog.\n\n(Source: MU)",
