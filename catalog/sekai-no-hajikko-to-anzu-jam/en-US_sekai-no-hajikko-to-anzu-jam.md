Instead of her father, Hina is the one running the duties of the Building Manager in "Apricot House." One day, Hina accidentally destroys the keyboard of room 304's strange resident. Hina is then asked by this strange guy to run errands for him as reimbursement. In truth, the resident of 304 is the charismatic vocalist of a popular band... What will be his true face!? What will Hina think once she sees him sing on stage?
