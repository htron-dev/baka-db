## Sinopse

Fifteen years ago, God has abandoned the world. Humans are no longer born, the dead no longer dies. In this desolate world, the only ones who can give peace to the dead are the "gravekeepers." On this day, the gravekeeper Ai meets her destiny. Hampine, a man with red eyes, astonishing beauty and silver hair and calling himself the "man-eating toy" appears in front of her. Ai embarks on a journey with him after he kills everyone in the village, believing him to be her father.
