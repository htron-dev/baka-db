## Sinopse

Jousei Tsubakiya is a rich law school student. Motoki Sakurai is the most popular guy in the education department. Together, they're the hottest guys around, and totally irresistible to ladies. After a party with no hot girls, with both of them drunk, they decide to go to a love hotel...! It was supposed to be a lark, but to Motoki's surprise, Jousei gets a hard-on. Motoki starts to give him a hand job and ends up getting hard, too. His curiosity piqued, things start to escalate until reason goes out the window, and before you know it, they've done the deed...!

These party legends are facing an existential crisis! Their relationship starts to morph, but is it love, or friendship...?
