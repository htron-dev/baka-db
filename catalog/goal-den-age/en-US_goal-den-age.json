    "sinopse": "Nine is the number of the best striker in soccer. Given the number 9 in the Megumi High soccer team, Fujiyama Kazuya is a striker with a parallel belief that a draw in a game has no meaning. To him, if you don't win, then there's no sense in playing at all. Despite that kind of mentality, their team has never won a game as of yet. How far forward will the boy who has never been victorious--but even so, is determined to win--reach when a mysterious man called Kuniyoshi Utagawa, who has a liking for the number nine, makes his appearance?\n\n(Source: MU)",
