## Sinopse

A tale of friendship between two girls who take care of each other.

The short Koike Natsuo is often mistaken for a primary school student. The tall Amano Oriko is often mistaken for a handsome young man. These two may not look it, but they're both 20 year old female college students! A spin-off from Dekoboko Girlish, Oriko to Nattsun is the story of friendship and perseverance. The two have just started to live together, but they mean more to each other than anything else.
