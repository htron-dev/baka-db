## Sinopse

At a glance, Oriko Amano is a cool, handsome male university student, whilst on the other hand, Natsuo Koike is small and childlike in appearance. However, the truth is that Oriko is actually a girl, and they are both twenty years old!

Dekoboko Girlish is a 4-koma that follows the daily lives of Oriko, Natsuo and the other members of their university's classical theatre group.
