Problem is: her grades are so terrible there's no way she can make it into such a high level school. Her mother then hires a high school girl named Rin as a private teacher to help her daughter. Seeing how the girl looks so much more mature than her, Mayuki ends up asking Rin to teach her more than just school subjects...\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
