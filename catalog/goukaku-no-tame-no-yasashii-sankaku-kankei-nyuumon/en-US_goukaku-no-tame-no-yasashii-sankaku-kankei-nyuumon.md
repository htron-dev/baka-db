## Sinopse

Middle school student Mayuki wants to enter Ootomo high school to join her beloved senpai Akira. Problem is: her grades are so terrible there's no way she can make it into such a high level school. Her mother then hires a high school girl named Rin as a private teacher to help her daughter. Seeing how the girl looks so much more mature than her, Mayuki ends up asking Rin to teach her more than just school subjects...
