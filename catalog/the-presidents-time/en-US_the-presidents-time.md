## Sinopse

Mutsuki inherited his father's company eight years ago. He's been doing fine as a CEO, but there's one thing that has always been a shadow lurking over him: He never accomplished his father's last wishes. Just before dying, Mutsuki's father told him "go and become the ultimate evil boss!" But Mutsuki is so kind that his daily attempts of training to commit evil deeds are a complete failure. Will he ever succeed, or will his father's last wishes be forgotten? Especially now that Mutsumi has met the beautiful Torii, and that he is falling for him...
