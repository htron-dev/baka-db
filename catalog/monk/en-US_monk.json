However, Dang's power is yet hidden; his true power is not seen until it is triggered by sexual impulses and turns him into a monster! Unaware of this, Dang enters Mouhyuk High, following the oracle's advice. But his class is a special class filled with a bunch of weirdoes the students call \"Trash\" and his biggest enemy, \"Coke Bottle\" woman! Can he complete his mission?",
