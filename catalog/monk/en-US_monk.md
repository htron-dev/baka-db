## Sinopse

Even the oracle that locates the Dalai Llama's reincarnation could not foresee that the troublemaker Dang will undertake the mission to find him. However, Dang's power is yet hidden; his true power is not seen until it is triggered by sexual impulses and turns him into a monster! Unaware of this, Dang enters Mouhyuk High, following the oracle's advice. But his class is a special class filled with a bunch of weirdoes the students call "Trash" and his biggest enemy, "Coke Bottle" woman! Can he complete his mission?
