    "sinopse": "A cute comedy about Kouhei Igarashi (boss, 45) and Wataru Momose (subordinate, 26). The first is hated for his horrible character and fussiness regarding work while the second is loved by everyone due to his kind nature, efficiency, and attractiveness. Igarashi cannot stand this \"perfect\" employee, but what he doesn't know is that Momose is secretly in love with him. What will happen between the two?\n\n(Source: Gakusei Scans English)",
