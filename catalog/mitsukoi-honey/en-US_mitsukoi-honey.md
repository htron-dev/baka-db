## Sinopse

"All girls can become cute."

What a lie… thinks Yuni. That Yuni could change like this is because of the new brothers she got through her father's second marriage, Yamato and Hiroto, who persuaded her to perform in an audition.
But Hiroto confesses to Yuni, who formerly got bullied for her "squish-face", so she's determined to become cute! What will be the conclusion for love and the audition?!
