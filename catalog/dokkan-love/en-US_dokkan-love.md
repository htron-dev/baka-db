## Sinopse

When the sinister Dark Guy and his evil army, Black Pierrot decide to take over the world, they decide to start from the Japanese countryside. Luckily, however, the great hero Blue Hunter is there to thwart him. But when Blue Hunter saves the young maiden Tachibana Honoka, he finds himself assaulted on another front... By her affection. Now he must juggle defending the earth, dating Honoka, and simultaneously trying to get her to take notice of his homely true identity, Fuwa Shinpei.
