    "sinopse": "Kazuya Shiina, our protagonist who was killed by a stranger when he tried to protect his childhood friend's little sister, was reincarnated into a world of sword and magic as Cain Von Silford, the third son of an aristocrat. Cain grew up being surrounded by gods that don't know self-restraint, the upper stratum of royalty, and manipulative girls. This is a classic fantasy about a slightly two-faced, slightly clumsy, and careless young man who, with the excessive divine blessings received from the gods, overcomes any obstacle that come his way while hiding his unbelievable status.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
