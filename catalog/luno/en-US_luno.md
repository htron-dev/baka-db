## Sinopse

Tete is a boy in a small European-like town. Recently some odd people have moved into the town, including the young vagrant Geeta who lives under the bridge. He befriends her and learns about her tragic past. Geeta then asks him to temporarily keep a mysterious clock for her. Shortly afterwards a dangerous man appears, one of the very last survivors of a race with powers over life and death. (Source: ANN)
