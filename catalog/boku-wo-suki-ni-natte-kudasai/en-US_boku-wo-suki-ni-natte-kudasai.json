    "sinopse": "A 30-year-old man is fangirling over his favorite idol, and then sees her on the train. Like a stalker, he follows her home and waits outside her place, but he was caught by her manager. He started crying because he didn't realize he was scaring her, which made the manager feel bad for him. The manager strikes a deal with him: he wont take him to the police if he sleeps with him.\n\n(Source: Mangago, edited)\n\nIncluded one-shots: Atama no Okashii Sex, Suana no Naka no Yamaarashi, Overheat",
