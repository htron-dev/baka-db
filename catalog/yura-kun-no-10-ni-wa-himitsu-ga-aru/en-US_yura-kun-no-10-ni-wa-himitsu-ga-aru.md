## Sinopse

"My classmate Yura-kun is always languid. He might be a vampire..." Kyouko's wild notions actually turn out to be true!! Once Yura-kun finds out that she has a "rare blood type," he begins to approach her. Are his actions out of love? Or is he just out for her blood, following his instincts? She's being pushed around by Yura-kun, who does everything at his own pace!!
