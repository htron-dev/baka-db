    "sinopse": "Four years ago Lucy, a world-famous model, vanished from sight. Now she lives in the scorching land of Andalusia, where she devotes herself to nursing an injured professor. And her heart, once frozen by scandal, is beginning to melt in the hot Spanish sun. At the same time, a seemingly menacing man appears. He owns the land she's been living on and is the older brother of Ramon, who has been showing an interest in Lucy. He viciously insults Lucy and offers her money to leave his land, which she firmly rejects. Will they be able to find a way around this impasse?\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
