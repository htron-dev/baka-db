    "sinopse": "Gorgeous, troubled Kaede is a next-generation flower arranger, a member of the student council at a prestigious academy... and more than a little depraved! Can he tame his desires and deal with the double-temptation of twin brothers? Whose bright bloom will he be most tempted to pluck?\n\nStorm Flower blends the delicate beauty of brand-new blossoms with the fears (and fantasies) of brilliant young men in a story that proves that two isn't always better than one! Is Kaede doomed to remember a violently vivid moment forever... or is he destined to one day repeat it?\n\n(Source: June Manga)",
