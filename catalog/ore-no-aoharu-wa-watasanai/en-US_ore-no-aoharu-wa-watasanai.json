Using shoujo mangas as his bible, he is constantly working towards becoming the ideal protagonist. One day, his old friend Jinnai, the only one that knows his true nature, transfers into his class! \"I won't let you interfere with my plans for my ideal youth!\" Yet, for some reason, his heart always pounds like the heroines of his favorite books when it comes to Jinnai!\n\n(Source: Tokuma Shoten, translated)",
