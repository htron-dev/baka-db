## Sinopse

Billions of years after an advanced human civilization was destroyed by aliens, twelve direct descendants of the civilization's warriors called "Sazers" have their powers awakened and form four tribes: Fire, Wind, Earth and Water. At first, they wage war on each other, but after learning the truth of their ancestry, the GranSazer tribes unite to protect Earth from the alien forces bent on once again extinguishing all life on the planet.
