    "sinopse": "A young photographer, Hirami Yuichi visits an island for an exhibition and meets the gallery's owner, Asahina Jun and fell in love at first sight. Even with a direct approach, it doesn't reach the heterosexual Asahina. However, one day when Asahina talked about his past with him, he was moved and he hugged him. Getting closer or staying away, both of them make it hard to leave. A painful love story that will squeeze your heartstrings. It is Nishi Noriko's debut piece!\n\n(Source: Hoshikuzuu Scans)",
