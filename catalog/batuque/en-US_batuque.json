Wanting to learn more about the Afro-Brazilian martial art that blends dancing, music, and acrobatics, she begins practicing with others in a local park under the guidance of the same man who helped her.\n\nIchiri slowly becomes enamored with capoeira and begins to find freedom from her father's strict rules. But she soon learns a harsh truth about her family, which forces her to face the dark underbelly of various martial arts and kick-starts her journey to becoming a capoeirista.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
