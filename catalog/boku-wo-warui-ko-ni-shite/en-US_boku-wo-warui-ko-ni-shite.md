## Sinopse

A serious student, "Shiraishi Makoto" is brutally abused by his parents and yet he longed for his parents' love. However, he didn't want anyone to know about his secret until one day, his classmate—Fudou, a heir to a wealthy company—found out about it. To keep him quiet, Shiraishi is willing to do anything to satisfy Fudou, yet Fudou forcefully asked Shiraishi to have sex with him.
