    "sinopse": "The protagonist of this story, Aichi Sendou, is a timid boy in his third year of middle school. He had been living his life looking backward rather than forward, trying not to stand out. However, he had one thing that kept him going—the \"Blaster Blade,\" a card from a card game that was given to him when he was little. That card is the reason why he begins to engage in Card Fights, something that changes his life drastically. The name of the card game is \"Vanguard.\" The game takes place at a different planet called \"Cray,\" and due to a never-before-seen play system, it becomes popular throughout the world.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
