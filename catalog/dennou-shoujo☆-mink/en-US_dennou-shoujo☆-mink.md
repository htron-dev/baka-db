## Sinopse

Minku Shiraishi is a 14-year-old middle school student obsessed with Illiya, the lead singer of a band called Jagunna. Along with her friends, fellow Illiya fan Mahoko Toriumi and tech-savvy Kanoka Moriyama, she enters the local music store to pick up Illiya's latest CD—but the CD they picked up is not Illiya's music but "Wanna-Be", a mysterious CD-ROM with its copyright date listed as 2099. Curious, Kanoka installs it into her computer and learns that the software can create virtual characters based off of actual people.

The girls then create a character based off of Minku and her dreams of being a star, dubbing it "Cyber Idol Mink." But when the character comes out of the computer and merges with Minku, the girls realize that they've made a mistake—after Cyber Idol Mink is sighted live on TV, all of Japan starts looking for her! Worse still, the mascot of the Wanna-Be program, Om, comes out of the computer and warns the trio that they are in danger of being "deleted" for using software from the future.

With the unexpected craze and Om's warning, Minku resolves not to continue using Wanna-Be—but when she learns that a new friend involved with stardom is in serious trouble, Minku decides to debut as Cyber Idol Mink to help them out and pave her way into fame.
