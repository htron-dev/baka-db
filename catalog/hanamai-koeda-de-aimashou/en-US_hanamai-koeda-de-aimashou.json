    "sinopse": "Ever since he was young, Mizuki's mother raised him up as a girl and forbade him from being close to other kids. Always dressed-up in a female kimono, this youngster is actually a successor to a wealthy clan. His mother hid his existence from Mizuki’s own father to prevent him from being caught in the crossfire of succession.\n\nAppearing on behalf of Mizuki’s maternal father, young lawyer, Hatano tries to convince Mitsuki, who he first thought of as a girl to meet ‘her’ long lost father. This homosexual lawyer has some devious plan to use the female Mizuki to gain success for his own good. What’s worse is that Hatano is a frequent customer in Hanamai Koeda, the restaurant which Mizuki is working as his boy-self. Oh boy, Mizuki better watch out or his cover will be blown!\n\n(Source: Echochi Scans)",
