## Sinopse

Being torn apart from his first love, Alex, a housekeeper's son, fell in love with his boss's daughter, Rebecca. Because of that, he and his whole family felt her father's wrath when they were fired. To protect his family and his younger sister, who was still only a child, he did whatever it took and became rather successful. He now had a mansion that rivaled Rebecca's father's. However, no matter how rich he got, he couldn't forget the shame and powerlessness he felt that day. Now a cruel millionaire himself, he comes face-to-face again with Rebecca to get his revenge...
