## Sinopse

Whatever he does, it always backfires, a salaryman who always fails, Saeki Katsuya. Facing restructing, a guy appeared before him when he wanted to give up.

“From the moment you put these on, your life will alter drastically.”

The glasses which were handed to him, seemed to be a forbidden item that will change its wearer into a dominant brute...
Having obtained the glasses and on the road to being a beast, will Katsuya obtain real love?
