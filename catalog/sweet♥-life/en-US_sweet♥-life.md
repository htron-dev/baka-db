## Sinopse

Kuramoto Yuushi, 17, is going out with aloof and arrogant, Kuzuhara Shuuichirou, a 28-year-old novelist. However, Yuushi's tender age makes him doubt his place as a lover to this mature adult who never expresses his feelings… Fear, insecurity and jealousy will assail young and earnest Yuushi who chases after the years that separate him from the man he loves… But sometimes the most immature and desperately in love is not always the obvious one…
