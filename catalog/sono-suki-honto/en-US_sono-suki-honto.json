    "sinopse": "The mechanic Hase has someone he cannot forget and that someone is Nadaguchi—his classmate he went out with on a punishment game who he later had a bad breakup with. Hase never thought that he would ever meet Nadaguchi again after graduating, but Nadaguchi suddenly joins the company where he works.
