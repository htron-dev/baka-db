His treasure is the golf ball that the caretaker at the country club gave to him. Eventually, Tao learns to golf when he receives a putter and it is immediately evident that he is a golf genius. Tao can 'feel' the grass on the golf course and can read the slopes extremely well. He meets Aoyama Takaya, a child golf prodigy that has been playing golf since he was 5 years old. Tao goes toe to toe with the golf genius and draws attention of many people. Tao enters the world of golf and his entire life is about to change.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
