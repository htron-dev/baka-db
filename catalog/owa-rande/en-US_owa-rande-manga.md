## Sinopse

Oz the Wizard is a young high school magician, who is powerful yet perverted. True to his desires, Oz summons and claims “ownership” of one of the rare Succubus, one who goes by the name Roselie. But, even though he summoned her for the purpose of doing all the perverted activities of his dreams, Roseli states that because she has an immense amount of “seductive mana,” anyone who touches her bare skin for more than 10 seconds will die. What is the use of a supposed-to-be lustful Succubus if you can’t even touch her for longer than 10 seconds? Will Oz be able to find a way to get rid of this obstacle?
