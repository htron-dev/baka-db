    "sinopse": "As the freshmen gather for the welcoming ceremony, all eyes—including those of the short and awkward Masaharu Tsuchiya—are on a beautiful and elegant couple walking through the doors. Stunned, Tsuchiya trips and accidentally pushes over a girl just as small as himself, Eri Watari. As he apologizes, the ceremony commences, and the clubs begin introducing themselves. Eventually, the dazzling pair from earlier walk up on stage, presenting to the new students the dancesport club. With the spotlight on them, the suave man and the gorgeous woman deliver a spectacle that blows the audience away.\n\nTsuchiya's friend suggests he join the dancesport club for the chance to meet and dance with the captivating woman from the earlier performance. When Tsuchiya approaches the club room to apply, a huge crowd of boys eagerly await, only to be quickly scared away by the terrifying club president, Masumi Doigaki. In the end, only Tsuchiya and Watari remain interested in joining the club. And thus, the two amateurs' journey in dancesport begins!\n\n[Source My Anime List]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 10: Kyougi Dance-bu e Youkoso",
