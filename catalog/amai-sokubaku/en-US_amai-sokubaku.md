## Sinopse

Masayuki is always being compared with his older brother, Hajime. Even though Hajime is better than him at everything, he's the one that's going to inherit the family's company. There's also the younger brother, Kei, who disappeared for five years and became a celebrity. Masayuki's feelings were already in a turmoil when, to make things harder, Kei suddenly reappears at a family gathering and brings back conflicts from five years ago.
