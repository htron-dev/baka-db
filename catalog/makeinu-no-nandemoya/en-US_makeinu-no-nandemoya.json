    "sinopse": "Atsushi, an ex-chef, Torajirou, a high school baseball player, and Nakagawa, a famous ex-composer (all 3 losers in life) started up a Convenience Agency. Then, as if fate had a hand in it, Nakagawa once again crosses path with Takahashi, an incredibly talented young composer, when a job that needs Takahashi's expertise arises, rocking the three's otherwise quiet life towards a whole new direction. From making you laugh to moving you to tears, this is a story of love and peace, and the world as seen by losers.\n\nfrom Forever More",
