## Sinopse

Narukami Jin is the only son in an extremely rich family who made their fortune off of the adult video industry. He inherited his father’s genes, which makes his man parts incredibly potent against hot girls. Every time he gets an erection, the women around him want Jin like there is no tomorrow. However, Jin’s father will only pass down the company to him if he stays a virgin for an unspecified amount of time. His personal maid, Chitose Kooni, is in charge of keeping him from slipping up, but as a teenager with the ability to turn on any beautiful women by just wanting them, Jin has the difficult task of abstinence, if he wants to live the rest of his life rich, famous and a player.
