## Sinopse

"It's your first time so it's okay, right?"

Manami, a highschool girl, joined the class party where there was fun, laughter, and drinking. She had the best night of her life until the next morning, when she woke up to find that she wasn't alone. She quickly looks over to see that lying next to her is her "friend" Motoyoshi Hajime. Did they actually do anything together?!! To the inexperienced Manami, her world is turned up-side down as she tries to figure out how to deal with this situation...

From the super popular mangaka Yasuko, a collection of stories that will melt your heart!
