## Sinopse

Wealthy girl Shirasagi Chihana woke one day to an empty house. Her father's company had gone under, and her parents had gone off traveling. They left Chihana all on her own to make her way to the boarding high school where she now has to live. Chihana has no idea how to take care of herself, but luckily she soon meets her roomate Megumi and other friends. Now it's up to Chihana's new friends to help her get used to normal life!
