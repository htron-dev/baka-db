    "sinopse": "Despite being an omega, Souichirou is hardworking and quite efficient at work. He aspires to become a politician. In spite of being rather beautiful, he didn't want to fall in love or get married, and wants to live his single life to the fullest together with his friends. A major reason for that is him being a severe \"neat freak.\" But fate had something different in store for him... He ends up meeting his destined partner, a handsome hunk who is a king.\n\n(Source: Modan Scans)",
