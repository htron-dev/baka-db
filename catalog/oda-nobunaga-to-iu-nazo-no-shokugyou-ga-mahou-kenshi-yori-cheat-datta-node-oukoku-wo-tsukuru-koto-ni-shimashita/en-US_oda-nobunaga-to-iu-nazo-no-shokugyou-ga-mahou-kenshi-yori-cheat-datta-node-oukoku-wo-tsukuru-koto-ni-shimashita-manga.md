## Sinopse

The greatest conqueror history's never seen!

At last, the time has come for the gods to bestow young Alsrod Nayvil with his official profession. As a minor feudal lord, Alsrod hopes he'll get a job impressive enough to let him step out of his older brother's shadow. However, he ends up with an unheard-of job called..."Oda Nobunaga?!"

It's not long before Alsrod learns the Oda Nobunaga entity involved is a famous conqueror from another world who will forever change his destiny! Now the young ruler has his sights set on greater endeavors?—namely, taking over the entire kingdom!
