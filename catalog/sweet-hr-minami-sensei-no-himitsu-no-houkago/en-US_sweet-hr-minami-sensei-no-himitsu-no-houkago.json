    "sinopse": "Minami-sensei is a new teacher working at a co-ed school. She's unreliable in that she's the type to get into a fight with a delinquent that she had been scolding, but that's when a strange conspicuous guy appears and saves her. It turns out that this guy is the head of the school cafeteria and that there's a lot more to him than meets the eye... With him out to win her affections, will Minami-sensei be able to become a respected teacher?\n\n(Source: Clairparfait)",
