## Sinopse

She dreams what any normal woman dreams: Find a good man and get married. There's only one hitch. She has absolutely zero talent in being a housewife! Determined to overcome this problem, she enrolls in classes to learn. The only problem is her teacher turns out to be a man and a younger one at that!
