## Sinopse

I was gently touched by a warm hand. The words that waited in the corner of my heart. That moment held a spark, something not to be shared with anyone else. That's fine. It's because of that it's fine. Your happiness is yours only--... As the title states, a collection of tragic and gentle stories.
