## Sinopse

In high school, Ryouko introduces her boyfriend, Otoumi Kou, to her best male friend, Yajima Yukari. Upon their first meeting, neither of them think highly of the other. It isn't until they get to know one another do they realize that their first impressions were sorely off key.

Despite Ryouko and Otoumi's break up sometime later, five years have passed and Otoumi and Yajima remain good friends. Always going out of their way to see one another occasionally, even if it it's not always an appropriate time.

It isn't until Otoumi's graduation does he get a confession from a school mate, Ochiyama, leaving Otoumi heavily confused. When he starts hanging around Ochiyama and even kisses him, Yajima is left confused about his own feelings towards Otoumi.

With the two of them confused, their friendship takes a dangerous and unusual turn. Will they realize the others feelings? or will they be forced to part ways?

Volume 1: xx Happier
