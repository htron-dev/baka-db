    "sinopse": "A near future where the energy supply foundations have collapsed. Humans marked with the electric seal, known as Porters, are tasked with the transportation of energy cells. Trancers, electricity as their weapon, wield overwhelming combat ability, together with Chargers, carrying massive amounts of electric charge and providing charge to the Trancers, work in pairs to fulfil their duty. This is the story of these Porters, still young, and their battle, their struggle, against adversity in a cruel dystopian future.\n\n(Source: Psycho Play)",
