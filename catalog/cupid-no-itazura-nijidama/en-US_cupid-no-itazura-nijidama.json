After he's used up all 7 of the chances, he'll never be able to have an erection and ejaculate, which means he will lose his ability to have sex for the rest of his life.

He has to save those precious bullets, but at the same time he desperately want to lose his virginity.\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 4: Senpai no Kanojo to Heya de",
