## Sinopse

Kyoko is shocked to hear that her husband has cheated on her with his secretary, especially since she isn’t even allowed to leave the house that much. Kyoko looks for shelter by her mother and has a good talk with her. What does it mean to be married? What does it mean to be divorced? When founding a new family, will the problems disappear?
