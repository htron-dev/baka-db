## Sinopse

Sayama Ten, common student, is one day accosted in class by a serious ikemen, Hachimaki Waka. His request is a bolt from the blue: Hachimaki wants to have sex with him! But they have never spoken to each other before and even if Sayama is gay, he is not the type to sleep with the first person who comes along. Furthermore, Sayama is a "cat" and Hachimaki is nothing like the man of his dreams. Yet, the very next day, even though Sayama rejected Hachimaki, the latter comes with a peculiar strategy: inundating him with strange gifts such as… fish-flavored snacks? Is Hachimaki really taking him for a cat!?
