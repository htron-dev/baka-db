## Sinopse

Shinnosuke Nohara might look like an innocent little kid, but anyone whose dealt with kids know they're anything but innocent. Relentlessly sassing the adults around him, pulling perverted pranks, and driving people to tears with embarrassment, Crayon Shinchan's the "kindergartner from hell," a five-year-old boy whose bodily functions, offensive comments, and outrageous behavior consistently annoy everyone around him. A national phenomenon in Japan, this shocking and hilarious comic celebrates the terrible power of destruction and indecency wielded by toddlers everywhere!
