## Sinopse

The anime's plot is taken from the 41st volume of the original manga's "Figure Wars" story. The story begins when toys of Oban, a character from a tokusatsu (special effects) television show, becomes popular, but also loses popualrity quickly. Many unsold Oban toys are thrown away. A bolt of lightning strikes one of these toys one day, and gives it life. Alongside other toys thrown away by people, Oban swears revenge on humans, and attacks. At the same time, Oban's sworn enemy Chūkōnen Kamen is also given life. Chūkōnen Kamen, normally a middle-aged, overweight, and depressed man, powers up by eating cup noodles. Alongside Shinnosuke, he will fight to reclaim peace for the world.
