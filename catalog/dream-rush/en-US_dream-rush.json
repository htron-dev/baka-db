When she’s hired for a drama starring young heartthrob Toujou Kazuha, she again fails to convince the director of her acting skills/ Kazuha, however, has a plan to get a real reaction from her and when it works she keeps her job. But she develops a real dislike for Kazuha, and a real flair for acting outside the script...\n\n(Source: MU)",
