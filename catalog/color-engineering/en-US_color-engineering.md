## Sinopse

This all-new book is designed and edited by the artist himself. It seamlessly integrates his lush painted canvases (often presented as gatefold pages) with a sequence of comic strips in a variety of techniques: photography, loose marker drawings, hyper real portraiture, and much more. Through it all he continues his investigations into the world of machines, architecture and post-human fashion.
