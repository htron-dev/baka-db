## Sinopse

A Mystical Winter is a magical, thrilling spectacle/family adventure that tells the legendary tale of The Mystical Spirit of Winter who maintains the harmonious balance on Crystal Peaks. Briar and Bramble were just cubs when they first heard the story. While getting lost in the woods, Bramble stumbles upon the lair of Neva, the Spirit of Winter and forms a long lasting bond with the mystical creature. Years later, the Spirit of Winter returns, and is being hunted by an ambitious collector. Bramble decides to go on a journey to find Neva, and save her from causing the dormant volcano on Crystal Peaks from erupting.
