## Sinopse

After the tiger hunting expeditions of Xiong Da, Xiong Er, Bald Qiang and Zhao Lin ended, Gou Xiong Ling established a nature reserve, which became a famous animal paradise, Black Wind, Jumping, Kangaroo Mother, Scrubbing, Three Old circus friends such as Corgi, Leidi, Gaga, and Grandma Elephant came to the reserve and started a new life through Xiong Da’s letter. The bald head became the gold guide of the reserve, and Zhao Lin became a volunteer in the reserve. . However, at this time, the new villains, genius Wei and Dong Dongyao, caught animals in the forest to earn research funds from Boss Wang.
He even extended his magic claws to the mountain god dumplings of Baixiong Mountain, and built a geonuclear energy extraction device, which severely damaged the ecological environment of the snowy mountains and threatened the safety of Gouxongling. In order to fight against the genius and protect the animals and the forest, Xiong Da, Xiong Er, Bald Qiang, and Zhao Lin united again and went deep into the forest, the Kingdom of Birds of Prey and the snow-capped mountains. After all the hardships, they defeated the tricks of the genius and finally defeated them. Genius Wei stopped the earth's nuclear machinery, and the snow-capped mountains returned to their usual calm. The positive energy and environmental protection themes such as adventure and growth, friendship and dreams, love of nature, caring for forests, and protecting animals run through the film, staged scenes of wonderfully funny, thrilling, and touching new adventure stories.(translated from baidu baike)
