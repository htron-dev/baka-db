## Sinopse

Vick and the bears find themselves stuck in the ancient past surrounded by gigantic animals who all seem to have one thing in mind-Lunch! When our heroes get separated, Briar meets up with a young wolf named Feifei, who is intent on becoming a brave warrior. Meanwhile, Bramble and Vick run into problems of their own when they are captured by a tribe of primitive humans whose leader falls ahead over heels for Vick. This is an adventure unlike anything they’ve ever faced before! Will they be able to reunite and make it back before they are stuck forever in the past?
