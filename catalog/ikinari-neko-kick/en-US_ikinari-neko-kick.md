## Sinopse

Masaru likes animals, especially cats. One day while out on a walk with his dog, he found a brown little kitten which looks like it's lost. Masaru can't help but bring the kitten home with him. But the next morning, the kitten has somehow turned into a little girl with cat ears! What's the meaning of this? And why does Charo (how Masaru calls her) look so familiar?
