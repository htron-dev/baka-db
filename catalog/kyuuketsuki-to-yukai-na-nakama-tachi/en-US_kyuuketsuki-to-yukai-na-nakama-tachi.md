## Sinopse

Since becoming a vampire, Albert's life has fallen into an unchanging cycle—day to night, bat to vampire, USA to... Japan? After a mishap at a meat-processing plant in Nebraska, bat-Al is flash-frozen alongside his midday snack and shipped to a foreign land! Explaining to police how he really ended up wandering naked is out of the question, not to mention he doesn't know a word of Japanese! Al will have to rely on the kindness (?) of his new companions if he's going to get by in Tokyo—that is, if he can convince them he's the bat!
