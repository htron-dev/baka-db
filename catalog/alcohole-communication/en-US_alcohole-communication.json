Tomo and Nao, two people from different walks of life, happen to meet one day at Aruko Hole. Despite their differences, they drunkenly become friends and start attending art exhibit \"dates\" together on the weekends. Their past and present anxieties burden them. But, as they reveal their worries to each other, their relationship becomes essential to both of them.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Sankaku no Namaiki (Brazen Triangle)",
