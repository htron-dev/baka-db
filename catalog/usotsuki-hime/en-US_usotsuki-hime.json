But then one day the exchange student Leila from Tokyo shows up in her class and the team of three gets shaken—because Koharu suddenly spends much more time with the cool Leila! Miku and Sawa are far from happy that their girlfriend suddenly likes someone else better. Will the girlfriends still be able to pull themselves together?\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Sayonara Bocchi",
