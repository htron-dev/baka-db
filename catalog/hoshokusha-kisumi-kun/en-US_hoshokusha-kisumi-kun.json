    "sinopse": "Yasuharu has all that it takes to be very popular. His only fault is loving his childhood friend Yuma way too much. Every time Yuma says his pet phrase, \"I wanna die,\" he replies smilingly, \"I'll eat you, then,\" creeping his friend out. But, one day Yuma says something that triggers a change in their relationship...! A stolen kiss, a daring request, forced cohabitation... the exciting story of a possessive love!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
