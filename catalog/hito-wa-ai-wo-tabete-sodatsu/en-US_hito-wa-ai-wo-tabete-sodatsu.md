## Sinopse

"A child who wasn't loved while small, when he becomes an adult remains a child."

A timid art teacher, over forty but still confused by love, despairs of ever finding a companion. A love-starved boy watches the kindness of families all around him, but insists he doesn't need anything like that. A college student living with his long-term partner purposely tantalizes a neighbor by loudly making love. A bassist fears "weirding out" his bandmates, so he keeps his life with his male lover under wraps. A contrary professor gives himself to a self-assured colleague one night, but it's not what either of them expect.
