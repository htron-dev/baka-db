## Sinopse

At my school we have a student council president who looks like he's out of a manga. Smart, handsome, from a rich family, serious and.. cruel when he rejects girls? When my best friend begs me to help her deliver her love letter to the president, I end up complicating everything with my bad habit of not staying quiet... Now... Why is the president interested in me?
