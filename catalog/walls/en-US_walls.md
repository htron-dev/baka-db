## Sinopse

A man walks in a crowd. He cannot stand the crowd but to cover his ears. Then it disappears and he gets lost in a white void space. In that space there is no other man but himself. He had nothing to identify himself and his existence was to come to naught. He starts to struggle to get away from there.
