## Sinopse

Meru has always dreamed of getting married, just like many other witches like her. She's to marry the werewolf, Riku, the upcoming night, but on their wedding day, their wedding is crashed by a hungry bystander, Rurupon! Rurupon runs off with Meru's veil, and she chases after him, only to walk into the middle of a curse Rurupon's master is causing! Meru is now a little girl, and with no way to change back, she can't get married! How will she ever return to her regular form and proceed with her wedding?
