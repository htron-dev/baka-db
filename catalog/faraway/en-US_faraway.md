## Sinopse

Tomoi wonders what is beyond the horizon, though he spends enough of his days skipping school and daydreaming his life away. When Kajita pays him a surprise visit at his home, he starts to notice the star basketball player more often. Afterward, the two slowly become friends and before they know it their feelings begin to change. When Kajita mentions leaving for a new school, Tomoi panics. Will their feelings go unnoticed?
