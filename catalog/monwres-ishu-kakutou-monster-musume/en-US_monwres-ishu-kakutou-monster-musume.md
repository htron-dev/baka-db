## Sinopse

It's claws versus tentacles as monstrous beauties grapple with one another in the global sensation that is monster wrestling! A young Cerberus girl named Tirol dreams of stardom in the squared circle, but can she stand up to all the thirsty predators ready to dominate her into submission? Winning in the ring means walking a fine line between pain and pleasure...and unleashing the beast inside!
