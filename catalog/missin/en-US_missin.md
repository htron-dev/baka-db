## Sinopse

How far can you go to get what you want before you lose your mind?Enter best-selling author Novala Takemoto's world, where music and the lost art of maidenly virtues walk hand-in-hand with madness. His characters stress, obsess, and sometimes get what they want...but often the life they thought they wanted is not always what they expected! (Amazon.com)
