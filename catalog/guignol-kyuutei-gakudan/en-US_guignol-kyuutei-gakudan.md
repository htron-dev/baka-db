## Sinopse

Lucille and the orchestra encounter a town overrun with the worst kind of audience: the living dead! Well, not really. They're people who have been turned into doll-like zombies. And they are definitely not a crowd to take lightly. Can a group of roving musicians use their skills to calm the beasts? Or is this curtains for the Grand Orchestra?!
