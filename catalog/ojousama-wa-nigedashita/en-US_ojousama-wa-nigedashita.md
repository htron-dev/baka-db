## Sinopse

Shizuka is a very beautiful ojou, respected daughter of the Nishizono household. Her father's company is having a slightly rough time financially and as is usual in the higher circles, her dad is trying to solve everything by having Shizuka marrying a prominent talent or a heir of a big family in order to expand & solidify the business... Shizuka is very respectful and loves her father a lot... but she absolutely hates having her freedom restricted, however her own father pushiness has created the habit of forcing her to run away from the house every time an omai looks to imminent.
