    "sinopse": "The elven-eared Misery is our guide to the Outer Zone, a place where reality and dreams collide (similar to The Outer Limits or The Twilight Zone). Humans, and even animals, sometimes find themselves wandering into this place on the edge of reality. For example, the first story involves a manga assistant who buys a love doll that is more than it seems, and the second is about a poor abandoned cat who is trying to find a way to survive in a cold park. Each chapter focuses on a different encounter with the supernatural!\n\n(Source: MU)",
