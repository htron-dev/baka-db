    "sinopse": "A collaboration between Kemono Friends and Nissin. They promote the latter's Donbei Kitsune Udon product with the Silver Fox and the Ezo Red Fox. In the first episode the duo are trying to figure out how to eat it as well as finding an old pay-per-view TV, putting money in it, and watching an \"old\" live-action Nissin Donbei Kitsune Udon commercial (said commercial is real and was created this year).",
