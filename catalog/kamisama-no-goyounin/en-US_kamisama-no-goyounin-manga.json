    "sinopse": "A \"steward\" is a human who asks after the needs of the gods. One day, after some strange geezer entrusts him with a book, chronic part-timer Yoshihiko finds himself calling on various of the countless deities and listening to their needs, accompanied by the fox god Kogane. Thus, he ends up at the beck and call of the gods of tale and legend, who seem more human than humans themselves.\n\nWhat can a mere human lacking any special powers or marvelous gadgets even do for them? And is he their assistant or just their errand boy? But there’s no denying the warm bond between the gods’ heartfelt wishes and humankind.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
