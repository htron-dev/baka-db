    "sinopse": "Youkai are mysterious, trouble-making spirits and demons that have tormented Japan for centuries. Kotoko's grandfather exorcised them for a living, but Kotoko never thought that her family lineage was an asset.\n\nThen she meets Kuro, a youkai doctor. Youkai have doctors? Now Kotoko is learning firsthand that healing the youkai is a lot more challenging than getting rid of them!\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 12: Kiraboshi Tentou",
