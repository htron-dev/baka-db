## Sinopse

Shannon's sister, Keira, is critically injured in a car accident, the same one that killed Keira's husband, Angelo. It's Luca, Angelo's brother—and Shannon's ex—who delivers the tragic news to her in London. "Are we alone?" he asks, barging into her home and searching through it. Shannon shakes with anger, realizing that he must be looking for a man. They'd been in love two years ago, until Luca accused Shannon of cheating while he was away and broke up with her without even letting her explain. Who would have thought she'd meet him again, and like this, of all the ways?
