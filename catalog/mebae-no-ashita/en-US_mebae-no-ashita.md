## Sinopse

An educational film about trying to see others by 'walking a mile in their shoes'. This one focuses on a listless teenager who is having trouble with his university entrance examinations and his father harping on him; and a pregnant woman who wants to work after the birth but her husband thinks it's wrong because a woman's place is in the home.
