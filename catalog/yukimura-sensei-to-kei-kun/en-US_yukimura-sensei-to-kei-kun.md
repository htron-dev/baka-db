## Sinopse

Until now, Sunose Kei has only dated girls, and he usually changes girlfriends every couple of months. Despite his romantic history, he has become infatuated with Tsukasa Yukimura, a 27-year-old professor who lectures in some of his classes.

Yukimura is aware of Kei's feelings, but as he never rejects him outright, the distance between them keeps growing smaller. Kei believes that Yukimura refuses to accept him because he is still a student, but the reasons are much more numerous and complex than that. Lonely at heart, Yukimura struggles to keep pushing Kei away—but not too far away.
