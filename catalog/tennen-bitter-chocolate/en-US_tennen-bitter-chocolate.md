## Sinopse

When Chinatsu falls in love, she falls in love hard. Her current crush is the boys' tennis team ace Kasai-senpai, whom she has liked ever since she saw him on her first day of high school. She joins the girls' tennis team in hopes of getting closer to him, but not only does it turn out that practice is grueling, but Kasai-senpai almost immediately tells her he has no special feelings for her. On top of that, his girlfriend bullies her regularly for getting in her way. But, as Chinatsu's childhood friend Iku says, love earned easily is boring...right?
