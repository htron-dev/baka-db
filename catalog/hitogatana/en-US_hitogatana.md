## Sinopse

In a world where it is possible to transfer human souls into objects, manned combat androids named "Katana" are used to commit heinous crimes and cause uncontrolled chaos. In response, the government creates the Anti-Katana Combat Division (AKCD) to maintain law and order. One member of the organization is Togusa, a human-Katana hybrid from the 8th Squad of the AKCD. Fighting against human and Katana enemies alike, Togusa must come to terms with his existence as a hybrid while unraveling the true nature and history of these androids.
