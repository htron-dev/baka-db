In response, the government creates the Anti-Katana Combat Division (AKCD) to maintain law and order. One member of the organization is Togusa, a human-Katana hybrid from the 8th Squad of the AKCD. Fighting against human and Katana enemies alike, Togusa must come to terms with his existence as a hybrid while unraveling the true nature and history of these androids.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
