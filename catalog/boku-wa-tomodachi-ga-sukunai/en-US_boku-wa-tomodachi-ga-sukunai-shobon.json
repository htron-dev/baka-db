    "sinopse": "Welcome to the Neighbors Club! Pull up a chair! Have a soda... or is that a love potion? Just don't get too comfortable, because the club is up to their usual shenanigans. You never know when you'll find them engaged in a questionable conversation about fetishes, or running a three-legged race to win the attention of the club's unwilling \"harem master,\" or sharing a moment of bonding in the school bathroom.\n\nWhatever the event, you can count on the Neighbors Club to march to the beat of a different drummer. This spin-off collection of short stories continues their misadventures and misunderstandings like never before, in their ongoing mission to try—and fail!—to make friends.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
