## Sinopse

In a world with gods having everlasting lives, suras who possess unrivaled power, and humans who caught helplessly in between, a girl with a god's name, Kubera, is born—a girl who is prophesied to bring great change into the world.

When Kubera's peaceful village meets its fiery end, a mysterious magician named Asha comes to her rescue. Together they begin a journey in search of answers and revenge.
