## Sinopse

Zara Evans abandoned her education and is working hard to pay off the debt accumulated by her aunt's illness. Independent and diligent, she's very different from the high-society women Nikolai Komarov is used to. But Nikolai has shut off his heart, which was broken by his mother, who left him for a new life. Zara can't be bought and kept like his past lovers, but he also can't provide her with the love she desires. Can Zara melt Nikolai's icy heart so he can learn to love?
