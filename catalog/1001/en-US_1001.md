## Sinopse

A tale of mystery and magic. Naito and Yuta Fuuga are twin brothers with very different personalities. While Naito is inelegant and good in school, Yuta is athletic and often winds up in fights. Despite this, they maintain a close relationship. When their father turns up missing, both must travel to Dubai in search of him. A mysterious peddler has other plans though, as the twins soon find themselves in the world of One Thousand and One Nights.
