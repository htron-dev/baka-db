## Sinopse

Asami Ike's created two works for the Zenkou-ji Monzen Eizou-sai (Zenkou-ji Monzen Film Festival). The event is organized by the Shinano Art Museum. The first "Aioi Ai oi Zenkouji-san" was an animated art piece projected onto the side of the theater where the festival was being held. The second "Aioiaioiaioi" is an animated short promoting the event (though uploaded a year later).
