## Sinopse

Shizuku is an adorable and spunky high school student, but even he doesn't know the secret he's hiding. When Shizuku comes home from school one day, he's met by a stunningly beautiful man. This paragon of exquisite beauty, Doga, tells Shizuku that Shizuku's true nature is that of an incubus. Doga is actually the demon king and once every hundred years, right at the cusp of mating season, he has to take an incubus as his love...What is Shizuku to do?
