This volume contains three one-shots by Akagawa Jiro-sensei and Matsumoto Yoko-sensei.

Norou Ningyou:
Mariko is a daughter of a wealthy family celebrating her 16th birthday. However, Mariko's crush Takayuki shows up with her friend Mio by his side and dampens her mood. To cheer herself up, Mariko looks through her presents and finds a cursing doll with a card that tells her how to use it to get rid of her enemies...

Shinku no Kage:
When she was young, Kaoru and her family spent a summer at a vacation home in the mountains. One afternoon, she and her younger brother Kazurou found a mysterious coffin in the basement. As she turned to leave, she thought she heard a voice say "Please move me". Little did she know that this was just the beginning of the huge tragedy that befell her family.
