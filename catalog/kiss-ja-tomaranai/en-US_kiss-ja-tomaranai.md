## Sinopse

Wataru and Makoto are friends from their early childhood. They are recognized as the gay couple in the school, and while Makoto appears to be ok with it, Wataru is greatly troubled by it and by Makoto's attitude. Since Wataru will not permit anything more than a kiss, the anxious Makoto visits his prep school teacher and tries to consult him about his problem. However, he's not aware of the danger that awaits him!
