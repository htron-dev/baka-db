    "sinopse": "How a young woman, romantically and professionally broken, will once again get a taste for life when she leaves the city to live in the countryside... Shino feels totally lost in her life. She goes out with a past work colleague, Masaki, quite macho...and troubles at her work make her leave it. She moves out, takes her independence, moves away from Masaki and settles in a tiny room in an old building of suburbs. On her arrival, she finds a little garden she shares with her neighbours, a couple her own age. And little by little, she feels more and more attracted to the mysterious man who lives next door.\n\n(Source: Shoujo Manga Maniac)",
