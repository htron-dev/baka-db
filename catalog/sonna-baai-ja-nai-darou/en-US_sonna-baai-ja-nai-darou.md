## Sinopse

Kamoi is an upstanding secretary for his political idol in the National Diet. Takagi was supposed to be just a one-night stand—until Kamoi finds out he is a young congressman from the opposing party! Soon, both men experience big shake-ups in their careers, but could these changes possibly bring them together?

Would That Not Be The Case! brings hot romance straight to the halls of political power. Read on as both men examine their political purposes in-between cross-party warfare and hot, steamy nights. What is Takagi's motivation for being in the Diet? What is it that makes Kamoi's job so painful? And when Takagi falls hard, who can him back to the top?
