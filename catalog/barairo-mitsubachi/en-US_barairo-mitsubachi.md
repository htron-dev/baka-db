## Sinopse

After the untimely death of his parents, Aoi was taken under the wing by the super-rich chancellor of the Tachibana Academy. Though Aoi is now a student there, he still hasn't met the chancellor. Meanwhile, Aoi is being persuaded by his bully teacher, Sakurai, and falls in love with him! Is Sakurai the chancellor? Aoi always wonders since Sakurai wears the same rose scent like the chancellor. Will this honeybee be able to resist such a sweet trap?
