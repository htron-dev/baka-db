## Sinopse

A trash can forest where everything is thrown away. Eve, a young girl who was dropped there, is picked up and raised by an old dragon who is about to die. Under the patronage of an old dragon named Nem, Eve grows up healthy, but the peaceful days are a moment of sad farewell. However, Eve takes a surprising action...? An old dragon and a girl, a fantasy of raising parents and children beyond species!
