## Sinopse

Our average heroine, Himukai Tamako, fell for the handsome Kishikawa Meguru, the very first time she set her eyes on him during the inauguration ceremony of her University. She tried to confess to him many times, but she had failed with flying colors every single time. And now, three years have already passed since she fell for him!

One day, Tamako noticed one of the most beautiful women in her University approaching Kishikawa! Tamako didn't think twice before finding herself spying on them as her instincts told her it was confession time! "Will he accept? Will he reject?" Just when Tamako's mind was about to go blank, Kishikawa surprised her by saying he had no plans to go out with anyone. As she tried to make a sense out of what she had just heard, Kishikawa caught her spying on him! Her instincts took her over yet again as she ran away from the scene.

Before she could properly apologize, the summer vacation has already started. If this couldn't have been any worse, in her first day after the vacation, she comes to know that Kishikawa has dropped out from the University. But she didn't even get the chance to confess to him once! This time she is determined to find Kishikawa and let him know about her feelings no matter what!
