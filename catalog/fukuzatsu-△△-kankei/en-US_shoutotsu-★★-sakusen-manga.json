    "sinopse": "\"I love you.\" \"That's disgusting.\" The kouhai that confessed who was fidgety and red-faced, turned out to be Shuuichirou. Although Atsushi rebuffs him in less than 3 seconds, this doesn't leave him to his peaceful life, rather, it leads to a daily love attack from Shuuichirou. Even saying his type is \"girls with big boobs\" doesn't stop Shuuichirou. In the midst of that, Atsushi tries to get Shuuichirou to back off by doing perverted things to him...?!\n\n(Source: Libre, translated)",
