## Sinopse

Tomomi Asahina greatly admired Tsuchikado Daigo, a doctor who saved her brother's life 17 years ago, so she became a paediatrician at the Tsuchikado children's medical clinic.

Unfortunately, children's medical clinics in Japan are on the verge of crisis because of a chronic shortage of doctors. Tomomi vows to fight hard for the children of the future.
