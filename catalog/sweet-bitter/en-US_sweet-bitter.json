Mizuha's whole world revolves around him until she meets, Chiaki, a guy sitting next to her who is a pudding-loving weirdo, who freaks out whenever someone insults pudding. Ever since Mizuha refused Chiaki's pudding, he has been trying to give her some each time he sees her.\n\n(Source: LuffyNoTomo)",
