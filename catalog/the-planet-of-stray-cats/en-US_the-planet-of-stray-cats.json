    "sinopse": "The Planet of Stray Cats, the \"grown-up\" CG gag comedy anime from studio Plus Heads collaboration with the \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" film. The film's director George Miller himself approved this collaborative short. The anime features the nonsensical, surreal conversations of stray cats on a planet. The only voice cast member, named Monica, ad-libs the dialogue of all the characters.",
