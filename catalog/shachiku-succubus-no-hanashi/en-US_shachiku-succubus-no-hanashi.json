    "sinopse": "Meet Lily. As a succubus, she is tasked with finding men every day, taking control of their dreams to steal their vitality. In return, Lily will fulfill any desires they have, no matter how perverted they are. And as the succubi population rate decreases, Lily finds herself more and more overworked in order to reach her rising quota.\n\nOne day, she enters the domicile of an exhausted corporate drone. Lily promises to make the man's wildest dreams come true, but what he asks for shocks her.\n\n(Source: MU)",
