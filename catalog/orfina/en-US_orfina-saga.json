    "sinopse": "Continuing on where the original series left off, it's back to character ATTRITION as familiar and endearing characters are revived and summarily executed in a race to put an end to the Granza-Cordea War.\n\nHaving lost Shisun at the end of the original series, Faana (aka Princess Orfina) was left traumatized and demoralized by the scale of the conflict. Everything and everyone she loved and held dear had been lost during the assault on Fort Malga. The few friends and allies Orfina had pulled her out of the broken fortress and placed her in the care of a nearby convent where she assumed the role of Sister Maria. What will become of the Granza-Cordea Conflict? What solution would Orfina use to end this bloody and atrocious war?\n\n(Source: MU)",
