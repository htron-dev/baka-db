    "sinopse": "The Kingdom of Granza is steadily building up their power and expanding their realm. Fleeing from the attack on her home, Faana and her companions hide in the woods, hoping to escape from the Granza Military. However, as her group is hunted down, Faana is the only one fortunate enough to escape alive. Half-dead, she somehow manages to travel several kilometers to the Kingdom of Cordeaa, where she passes out in a lake. Upon awakening 3 days later, she is surprised to find herself inside the castle of King Yogufu, the ruler of Cordeaa. Faana is even more surprised though, when she meets his daughter, Princess Orfina--the two girls are identical strangers. The two become fast friends, but this period of happiness doesn't last long as Granza soon advances it's power into Cordeaa...\n\n(Source: TJO)",
