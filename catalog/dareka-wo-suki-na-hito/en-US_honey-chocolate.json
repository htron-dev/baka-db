    "sinopse": "Poor, frazzled Asada! He's definitely got a thing for his cool teammate Tetsuo, but he can't tell if Tetsuo likes him as a best friend... or that way. And just as Asuda lays his heart on the line, who would appear but a mysterious (and annoying) new woman! These feisty boys are gonna have to deal with snarky schoolmates, mixed messages and surprise haircuts if they want to score both on and off the court! Who will finally make the winning play?\n\nHoney/Chocolate mixes fresh, sweet innocence with a hint of deep, dark seduction to create tales so tantalizing you'll be begging for another mouthful! Two young schoolmates fumble to find the right words for their budding emotions, and a teacher reconnects with a beloved face from his past with the help of a crazy student. Whether they're looking for forbidden romance or they simply stumble upon it, there's no doubt that these men are in for a truly delicious ride!\n\n(Source: Jun√©)",
