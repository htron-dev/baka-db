## Sinopse

Shorts that aired within "Fight Tension☆Depart," a variety program that originally aired the anime as one of its segments. Celeb-chan is a narcissistic school girl who believes that she is a celebrity because her family is incredibly wealthy. She tries to do typical rich people things such as starting her own heavy makeup line, becoming a singer, saving an endangered species, buying a teacup poodle, etc. The results are never how she expects it.
