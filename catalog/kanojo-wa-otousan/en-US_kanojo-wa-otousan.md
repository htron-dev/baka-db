## Sinopse

Two miracles are happening to the high schooler Naoyuki Ono's life. The first is him going out with a beauty of his school, Shiori Sakura. The second is that she turns into her thick-headed father if Ono touches her. The cute girlfriend and her terrifying father are stuck in one body. Even if he wants to touch her, he can't.

And so, the curtain rises on this father-daughter fusion love comedy!
