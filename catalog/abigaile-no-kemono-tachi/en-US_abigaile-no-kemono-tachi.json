That is until she's beset by a mysterious young man with a steely gaze and furry wolf ears—who promptly bites her! Nina finds herself turning into one of these beasts of legend, and whisked away to the prison of Abigaile where all their kind are sent. Nina must keep her wits about her if she's to learn the secrets of this magical world where everyone either makes her blood boil or her young heart race!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
