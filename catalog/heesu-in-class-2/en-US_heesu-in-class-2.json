    "sinopse": "Heesu's world revolves around Chanyoung, his best friend and secret crush. He doesn't mind cheering Chanyoung from the sidelines or listening to all his girl problems. He doesn't care if people only know him as \"Chanyoung's friend.\" Then one day, Heesu starts hearing his name everywhere. On the bus, in the halls, during lunch... Turns out, there's a rumor going around school (Got a love problem? Find Heesu in Class 2 and he'll tell you what to do!) and with that, Heesu suddenly finds himself the center of attention. But how could he give anyone advice? He doesn't even know what to do about his own crush!\n\n(Source: Lezhin Comics)",
