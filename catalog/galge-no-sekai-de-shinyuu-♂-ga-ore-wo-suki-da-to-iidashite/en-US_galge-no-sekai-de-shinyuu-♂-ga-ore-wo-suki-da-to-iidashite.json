    "sinopse": "Dull-headed Aoi Momose insists to his friends that he has always lived for friendship, not romance. However, deep down, he believes the exact opposite and is jealous of the blooming relationships around him. Thus, when he buys a love simulation game, Aoi finally has the chance to experience firsthand the idea of having a partner! He decides to play it at the house of Ritsuki Okamoto—a childhood friend of his. Initially intending to do homework, a curious Ritsuki joins Aoi, causing the start of a misadventure.\n\nSoon, the two arrive as high school students in the virtual world of Kyun Koi and meet their jovial flying navigator, Pota. Pota emphasizes that to reach the game's ending, Aoi must attain a relationship with one of the girls he will encounter at school. While Aoi considers this as an opportunity, Ritsuki deems it otherwise. When his heart finally cannot handle the situation, Ritsuki decides to profess his love to Aoi! Astonished by the revelation, can Aoi even choose a partner at this rate?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
