However, Tasuna was later sold to a noble and sexually abused. Desperate and with nothing to lose, Tasuna flees deep into the mountains in search of the old apprentice. Exhausted, Tasuna collapses and later awakens in a cave with a strange man named Azeri. Tasuna soon realizes Azeri is the man he’s searching for and begs to become his apprentice.\n\n(Source: shinkeikaku)",
