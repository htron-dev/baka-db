    "sinopse": "The Inui family came from a long history, about 300 years back. Inui Souwa and Inui Setsu are two cousins who are staying together. They go to school like any other high schoolers do but they are different. Setsu is a gambler and he is a priest who can summon any spirit or ghost. Souwa, on the other hand, doesn't believe in any supernatural phenomenon or spirits, etc. because they are not scientifically proven. He also refuses to inherit his family business even though he actually acts as a medium for spirits to possess.\n\nWhen Souwa's mother went travelling and did not pay the tax, both the cousins had to work it off to earn the huge amount of money. Of course, they have nothing but their family business to rely on. But will they make a good pair when all Souwa believes is that they are actually cheating the customers? What about Setsu with the \"yin yang eye\" who is extreme and dominating?\n\n(Source: Manga Updates)",
