## Sinopse

Yuria is a humanoid dutch wife (love doll). A female android designed with the sole purpose of being the sex slave of her master. But she has one flaw. She doesn't want to be a dutch wife. After escaping from her creator, she meets Kubo Shunsuke, who gives her a place to stay. Hilarity is bound to ensue as she battles her programming, which draws her towards him, and pretty much any other man she comes across.
