## Sinopse

Koharu's has lived her young life by her mother's motto: a good woman never gets rejected. But when the most popular guy in school turns her down before she even gets the words out, her whole world comes crashing down... until she realizes, if she just keeps confessing, she'll never get rejected! And as an unlikely friendship begins between the two, she's given an ultimatum: he'll say yes when his heart leans 100% towards her! A goofy, assertive romantic comedy!
