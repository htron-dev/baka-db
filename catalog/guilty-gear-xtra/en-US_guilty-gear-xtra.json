    "sinopse": "Set in the year between the events of the first two games, the story revolves around two new characters exclusive to the manga: Tyr and Mizuha, and the mystery of severed Gear parts falling from the sky. Members of the Post War Administration Bureau (P.W.A.B. for short) - the secretive organization responsible for many events in the games - serve as the antagonists of the story. Characters from the games, such as Sol, Ky, Axl, Potemkin and Kliff, also appear, albeit with relatively minor roles.",
