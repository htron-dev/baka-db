    "sinopse": "Rui, the number one host of club Baroque in Kabukichou, changed from his newcomer days when he was called \"prince\" to a trashy host who sells by pushy methods and sleeping with clients. The biggest eyesore for him is currently the presence of the number two host, a calm newcomer called Youji. One day, Rui gets dead-drunk at an after party and Youj,i who had been sitting with him, makes love to him at a hotel, making him get erectile dysfunction because of the shock!! From that day on, his life that he thought was going well starts getting out of order as if falling down a slope...!? Love is fictitious, the only thing that can be trusted is money. An exciting and pure love comedy unfolding in a world full of desire!\n\n(Source: Takeshobo, translated)",
