## Sinopse

2. How to Keep a Mean Guy
   Momose tells Kaoru that he wants to break up, but Kaoru asks, "Were we going out?" Kaoru is a perverted playboy from a family of seductive men and women. Momose is his childhood friend who loves him. But even though Kaoru holds him, Momose knows Kaoru can never be the kind of dependable guy he needs.

4)Milk
Since Yoshiharu's drunken confession to Takiyuki three months ago they've been dating, but Yoshiharu can't seem to get anywhere physically with Takiyuki. Maybe some hypnotism or an aphrodisiac...

5)Flower Arrangement of Love
Daikichi is the son of a yakuza, but his real joy in life is sexually harassing Saburou, the son of his father's teacher. Saburou wants nothing to do with sex-obsessed Daikichi. But Daikichi doesn't always play fair...
