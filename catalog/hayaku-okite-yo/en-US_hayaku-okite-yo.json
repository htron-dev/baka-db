One day, he has a dream about his first time, with the most popular girl in class! But when that doesn't turn out at all like he expected, he has another dream about sleeping with a girl he's never seen before...a dream so powerful he ejaculates in his sleep! But when he finds her, he runs into a huge problem...she's allergic to men? Aren't his dreams always supposed to come true in the same day!?\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 6: Little Boy",
