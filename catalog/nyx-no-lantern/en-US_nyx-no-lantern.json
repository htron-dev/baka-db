    "sinopse": "In 1878, as the wave of Western culture spreads through Japan, Miyo, a girl orphaned in the Satsuma Rebellion, works at a curio shop in Nagasaki called Vingt. The dresses, sewing machines, binoculars, boots, and other items acquired at the Paris Exhibition by the proprietor Momotoshi Koura have aroused her curiosity. Miyo accumulates experience in her job while using the clairvoyant ability which she has possessed since she was very young. The story vibrantly depicts a new age that visits a Nagasaki thriving with merchants and prostitutes, centering on Miyo's changes as she begins to experience feelings for Momotoshi akin to the awakening of love, and Momotoshi's past, which gradually comes to light.\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival)",
