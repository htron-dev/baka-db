    "sinopse": "Takagi just started her dream job at a gaming company! Not only that, but she'll be working for her idol, the famous game designer Sakurazuki Kaori! When Takagi finally meets her hero, she's in for a shock: Sakurazuki is harsh, blunt, and better at playing video games than dealing with people. As Takagi and Sakurazuki work together, the two women grow closer and even fall in love. Can they keep it professional, or will the whole workplace find out?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
