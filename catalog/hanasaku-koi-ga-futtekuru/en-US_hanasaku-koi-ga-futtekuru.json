He is saved by Tomoru, who in response to Ritsu's request to pay him back, asks for his help in his after school job...as a professional girls' manga author. Ritsu agrees to act out scenes from Tomoru's manga, but when he learns he is meant to play the rival character instead of the hero, he grabs Tomoru by the collar and forces a kiss on him...\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
