## Sinopse

Hakkan Colon
Satoru Hayase strikes Amamiya as the kind of person who places himself above the trivialities of the lives of high school students. Although his carefree attitude infuriates her to no end, Amamiya cannot get enough of the sweet scent that always seems to waft from his direction.

Hakkou Hair
For high school student Ran Shiomi, her hair is her most precious asset. So when Masamune Toki, a boy from an elite high school, rescues her from a situation where she would have needed to cut off her beautiful tresses, she offers to do anything for him in return. However, Masamune asks her to give him what she values the most—her hair!

Hatsunetsu Hoippu Cream
Haruko Toda is the culinarily talented and uptight leader of her school's cooking club. When Keita Momoya applies to join the club, Haruko takes one look at him and assumes that he will only fool around. But as time passes by, even with Haruko's sharp sense of taste, she can barely resist Keita's innocent boyish appeal.

Hatsujou Drop
Ririko Tamai comes across as a serious student to her classmates. On the other hand, her classmate Nona is a boy who does not think twice before kissing just about anyone. However, things take an awkward turn when Nona witnesses Ririko kissing a statue in the art room. As it turns out, neither Ririko nor Nona exactly fits their reputation.
