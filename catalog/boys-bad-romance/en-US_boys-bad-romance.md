## Sinopse

While now working in his family's café, back in high school, Kyousuke's face was scarred in a sudden attack by a delinquent classmate. Due to this, the café's customers are often terrified of him! Then one day while checking out a new store opening up next door, he realizes it's actually a brothel! But more shockingly, he finds Mikado, the one who gave him the scar there too! A high-tension story about the bonds of fate, going all the way back to their school days!
