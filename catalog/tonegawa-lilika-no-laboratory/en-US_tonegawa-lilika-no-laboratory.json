    "sinopse": "Tonegawa Lilika may be the daughter of the famous biologist Tonegawa Midori, but she personally hates math and science. She's most interested in being fashionable. But in order to save a friend, Lilica makes a contract with a strange blonde man in foreign clothing: she receives a flask to summon famous scientists, and he vows to make her like science.\n\nThis mysterious bishounen introduces himself as the greatest scientist of Ancient Greece, Archimedes.\n\n(Source: Batoto)",
