## Sinopse

Tonegawa Lilika may be the daughter of the famous biologist Tonegawa Midori, but she personally hates math and science. She's most interested in being fashionable. But in order to save a friend, Lilica makes a contract with a strange blonde man in foreign clothing: she receives a flask to summon famous scientists, and he vows to make her like science.

This mysterious bishounen introduces himself as the greatest scientist of Ancient Greece, Archimedes.
