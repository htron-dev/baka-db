## Sinopse

This is a great old school classic about a young boy raised from even before birth to become the greatest Kendo champpion in all of Japan. With a martial arts expert for a father and a mother with an enthusiasm streak you’ve rarely seen – their son Musashi is born to be super strong, fast, and trains harder than anyone – so how can he not become a champion?
