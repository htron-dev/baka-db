To curb the labour shortage caused by a declining population, the government decided to integrate the Youkai into society; however, this led to rising conflicts between Humans and Youkai.\n\nIn response, the JSDF, with aims to expand their influence in public security, secretly forms a Youkai penal tactical response force, \"Tachikawa Task Force\", to execute \"tactical solutions\" for the various issues born from this new society.\n\n(Source: MangaDex)",
