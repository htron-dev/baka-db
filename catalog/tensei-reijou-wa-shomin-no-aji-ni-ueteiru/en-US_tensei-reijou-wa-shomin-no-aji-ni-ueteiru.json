    "sinopse": "One day, I realized that I, a former Japanese, reincarnated into a different world as Cristea Ellisfeed, a duke's daughter. Reincarnation...? Duke's daughter...? A world with magic...? Is this a light novel?! Despite being confused, I had to accept this reality. However... I'm dissatisfied with this outcome! This full-course meal is somewhat dissatisfying! All the sweets are sickeningly sweet! I can't take it anymore!! The taste of commoners, please!!\n\n(Source: AlphaPolis, translated)",
