## Sinopse

From their offices high in a corporate skyscraper, alpha males Ozaki and Tsuburaya make all the girls swoon. Ozaki's known for his irresistible pheromones, while Tsuburaya's a noble, worldly genius. But when these rivals end up in bed together, who will prove to be top dog? It's seme versus seme—and much more than pride's on the line!

Ozaki and the ultimate gifted playboy prince Tsuburaya: both are rivals in the same company. These two men will end up in bed together. Which one will lead? A top x top fight outbreak.
