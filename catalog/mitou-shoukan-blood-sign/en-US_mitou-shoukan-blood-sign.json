    "sinopse": "Summoning ceremonies can freely call forth even \"those which lurk in the depths beyond the gods.\" One boy has top-level abilities even among the cutting-edge summoners who can use those ceremonies. He is \"Alice (with) Rabbit\" aka Shiroyama Kyousuke. But this strongest boy summoner has a single fatal weakness. Certain \"cursed words\" spoken by girls: \"Help me.\"\n\nWhen Kyousuke hears those words from Meinokawa Higan, a girl brought to the verge of death, he throws himself into a city where three great summoner forces clash!\n\n(Source: Baka-Tsuki)",
