## Sinopse

Devastated by the death of his world famous dancer mother, Theo Galland abandons his dancing career for Hollywood acting and meets the famous actor Darren Ferguson. What should have been a joking kiss shared between them takes a sudden turn, however, when Daren asks, "So what comes next?" Theo answers, "That depends on the scenario." As lustful passions boil over, will Theo be able to regain the fire that he once possessed and return to the dancing world?
