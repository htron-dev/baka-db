## Sinopse

Leo is a popular but self-conscious guy on campus who's been hiding the fact that he can't "get it up" lately. Not even therapy (porn) seems to help. At a party one night, he's forced to kiss his popular and irritating neighbor Ryosuke in front of everyone. Ryosuke's unexpectedly skillful tongue takes the lead, moving deeply inside Leo's mouth... Then Leo's body begins to react. Leo thought he had erectile dysfunction, so how can he be getting turned on in a situation like this...!?
