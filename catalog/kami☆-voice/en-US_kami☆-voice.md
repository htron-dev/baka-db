## Sinopse

Voice actors give a voice to all of the characters we see in animations, movies, and video games we see every day. Voice acting as a profession has become popular among the younger generation, adding up to over 400,000 applications every year. In this industry, there exists a legend. The legend states that there exists a "God Voice": the perfect voice that will bring about a revolution in the voice acting world. This story revolves around two best friends that grew up together. Shiraike Yuu has always been the mischievous one, always using his innate ability to mimic others' voices. Kubotera Tatsuma has always been the quieter and logical counterpart to Yuu. These two will train together to bring about a revolution in the voice acting industry.
