## Sinopse

Kawano went back to his hometown because his father fell ill. He decided to resign and stayed behind to take over the family farming plantations. However, he didn't inform Nagaura, his lover, about his decision until much later. Feeling insecure about their future, Nagaura decided to do something about their long distance relationship.
