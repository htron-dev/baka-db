Born from within the magical character stones, Oki grew up around the ancient mountain monkeys until one day, he left to collect all of the magic character stones scattered throughout the world. During his journey, he meets Bori, a master in the arts of the magical character stones and together, they set off on a journey to train in the ancient arts of character magic.

One day, as Bori was training Oki in the arts of character magic, they run into Master Sal, who tells them about the mysterious sorcerer, Jin. Jin is collecting the 108 magic runes to resurrect the evil dark lord Chaos and it’s up to Oki and his new found friends, as well as his knowledge of the character stones to stop Jin from resurrecting Lord Chaos in time.

The franchise is meant to be an educational series helping children learn hanja, which are Chinese characters borrowed from Chinese and incorporated into the Korean language with Korean pronunciation.

The TV anime was entirely produced in stereoscopic 3D CG. Children could watch the how with red-blue 3D glasses. Later a non-stereoscopic 3D version was rebroadcasted that did not require glasses.
