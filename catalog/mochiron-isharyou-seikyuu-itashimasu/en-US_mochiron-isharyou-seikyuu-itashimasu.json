    "sinopse": "Romance is great and all, but nothing satisfies Yulia Nogah quite as much as a hefty profit! Betrothed to the marquis's son Ramor Curion when she was little, she paid little heed to his rude personality, focusing rather on the potential business opportunities from his title. As she has never had an emotional attachment to him, Yulia doesn't care when he annuls their engagement to be with Julie Banache.\n\nIt turns out that Miss Banache has delusions of grandeur, believing herself to be the main character of a popular novel in which the protagonist is loved by many noblemen, including a marquis's son and the prince of the country. She has superimposed everyone in her life onto the characters—Yulia as the villainess, Ramor as the secondary male lead, and First Prince Rudonik Reino Palacio as Miss Banache's fated one—using the plot as a forteller of future events.\n\nBut fiction is only fiction, and the one behind the book's publication is Yulia herself. Never one to miss out on a profit, she has taken every opportunity to expand her businesses, and romance is just another lucrative venture!\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
