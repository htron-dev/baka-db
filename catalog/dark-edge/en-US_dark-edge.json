    "sinopse": "After his mother's death, Kuro Takagi transfers to Yotsuji Private High School where his father is the proprietor. But Yotsuji is no ordinary school. It holds a strange rule of “No students on campus after dark!” On his first day of attendance, Kuro and his classmates inadvertently break the school’s highest protocol and find themselves victims of a faculty zombie attack. Although they manage to narrowly escape, this is but a prelude to more encounters with the undead, especially after Kuro discover his own blood-ties and latent zombie abilities. From there, it's full steam ahead as this dark and intense action/comedy shifts into high gear. (Source: DrMaster)",
