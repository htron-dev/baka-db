    "sinopse": "One morning, Hiiro’s bus is attacked, and he ends up in the city that is supposed to be sealed: Tokyo. When he arrives, there are people like him, people who have the “red eye”. Known as the Pandora Virus carriers, they believe themselves to be comrades, and find themselves attacked from all sides. The reason for these attacks are hidden in the bodies of Hiiro and his comrades, something to do with their genes.\n\n(Source: MU)",
