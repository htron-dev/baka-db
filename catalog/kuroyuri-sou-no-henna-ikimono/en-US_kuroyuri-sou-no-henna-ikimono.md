## Sinopse

The apartment-sharing comedy manga begins with Meme, the daughter of the demon world's most powerful summoner. After her father suddenly casts her into the human world to teach her some lessons, she finds an ad for an apartment with no rent or upfront fees. The catch: she has to entertain the young landlord Sentarou. To pass the test, she summons a strange creature and causes Sentarou to have a nosebleed.
