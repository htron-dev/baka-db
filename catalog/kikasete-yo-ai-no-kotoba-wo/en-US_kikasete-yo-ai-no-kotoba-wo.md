## Sinopse

Young actor Hinase, together with experienced actor Saiga, are secret lovers. Just 19 years old and possessed by heat, while Saiga always stays calm, makes Hinase feel like he's being looked down upon and seen as a child, which makes him very angry!! Always being seen this way by Saiga, and having enough, the two are still no reconciled. As a result, Hinase wants to fool Saiga more and more?!

This is simply two men who like to love each other in this manner!
