    "sinopse": "Evan Pryce is a celebrated New York Times reporter, and true to his prominent journalistic lineage, he has just published an exclusive scoop that is brilliant enough to be considered for the Pulitzer Prize. Unfortunately, this also makes him easy prey to the many enemies he has made throughout his career. Instead of going in hiding, however, Evan decides to hole up at his press office - not the safest place for a man in Evan's situation. Unwilling to have his star reporter remain so vulnerable to attack, the Editor-in-Chief orders Evan to cover an out-of-state story: \"real\" ghost sightings in a secluded village in the countryside—an article too absurd to be handled by the New York Times. For lack of a better thing to do, Evan decides to follow his editor's orders and drives across the Midwestern desert searching for a town nobody seems to have heard of. After ten days of driving by sleepy rural villages with zero results, our lost and exhausted New Yorker is just about ready to give up. But then suddenly, a road sign pointing to \"Roureville\" catches his eye, and he heaves a sigh of relief. Little does he know that the end of his long road trip is just the beginning of an incredible tale.\n\n(Source: Netcomics)",
