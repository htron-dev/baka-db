    "sinopse": "First year Teppei Hino of East High has a lifelong enemy. His nickname is \"The Demon of the West,\" but his actual name is Onikubo... a second year whose goal in life is to tangle with East High students. No matter how many times he gets called out, he's so strong no one can make a dent... and yet, he only has eyes for cute things! One day, Hino picks up Onikubo's chick coin purse, and Onikubo thinks \"that blonde nape of his makes me think of a chick\"—and becomes attached to him! Furthermore, he's able to go from \"I don't hate you\" to a kiss...?!\n\n(Source: Kaiohsha, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shots: After School, Tayutau Kodoku",
