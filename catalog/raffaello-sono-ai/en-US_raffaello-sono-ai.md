## Sinopse

Born at the end of the 15th century in Italy during the Renaissance, Raffaello is regarded as the greatest painter of his period. Starting from the city of Urbino, he lived in Florence, met with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, and worked for the papacy at Rome. Raffaello died at 37, yet he had a life of success, a life recounted in this manga.
