## Sinopse

Honjou Naru is an 18-year-old young man studying at Libre University. In his entire lifetime, he never once had a girlfriend. The reason for this is his abnormality and narcissism, which only happens if he sees a reflection of himself. To prevent that, he needs to wear contacts all the time. One day, his contacts fell off and were stepped on by the most handsome guy in school Takashina Mamoru! This chance encounter would change his life forever...
