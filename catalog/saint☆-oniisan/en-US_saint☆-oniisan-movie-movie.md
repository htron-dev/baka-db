## Sinopse

After thousands of years of hard work, Jesus Christ and Gautama Buddha decide that they have earned a vacation and descend from the heavens to rent a small apartment in Tokyo, Japan. As the pair struggles to live incognito, they enjoy the luxuries of modern society, such as amusement parks, and limited-time store sales. Jesus and Buddha take the time to celebrate each other's holidays, watch the changing of the seasons, and explore their new surroundings. Saint☆Oniisan follows the two religious figures as they meet new people and face the everyday challenges that come with living in Tokyo.
