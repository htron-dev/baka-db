## Sinopse

Endou Mizuki is a high school freshmen with no friends. But, one day she gets a reply on the message that she wrote on her desk. It's a strange way for two people to get a connection, but it happened! As a result, she meets a person who is completely her opposite, the orange-headed Youta. And just like that, Mizuki's small world begins to grow.
