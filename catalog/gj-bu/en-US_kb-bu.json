Every character from GJ-bu is in the world of KB-bu, but there are a bit different from their personalities of GJ-bu. Mao writes action stories and doesn't bite Kyouya's head, Shion writes erotic doushinji and is more assertive with Kyouka, Megumi writes stories with an evil princess main character, and Kirara, who is shy and quiet, makes picture books.\n\n(Source: Myutaku)",
