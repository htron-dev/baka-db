## Sinopse

This novel is an alternate setting where the world of GJ-bu is a novel written by Kyouya Shinomiya, member of the KB, a club in which everyone writes stories. Every character from GJ-bu is in the world of KB-bu, but there are a bit different from their personalities of GJ-bu. Mao writes action stories and doesn't bite Kyouya's head, Shion writes erotic doushinji and is more assertive with Kyouka, Megumi writes stories with an evil princess main character, and Kirara, who is shy and quiet, makes picture books.
