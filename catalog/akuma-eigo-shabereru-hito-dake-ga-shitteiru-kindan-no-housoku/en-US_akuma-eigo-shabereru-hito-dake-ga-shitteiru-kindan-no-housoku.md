## Sinopse

In the story, bookstore employee Kousuke is one of many Japanese people who believes he has no ability to speak English. He buys a book titled "Devil's English" and accidentally summons a demon. Kousuke is confused because the devil can only speak English, but the devil says to him, "You can speak English already! You just need to throw away four things."
