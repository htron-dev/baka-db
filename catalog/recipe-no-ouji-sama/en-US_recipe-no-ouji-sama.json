    "sinopse": "Second year culinary student Sakai has always dreamed of opening his own little restaurant and being able to touch people's hearts with his cooking like his grandfather did. Except he's at his limit, fainting in class from overwork and fatigue from commuting 3 hours every morning just to get to school but there's no way he can afford to live closer...until his classmate tells him about an almost too good to believe room share nearby. And so begins the story of 4 misfit roommates.\n\n(Source: MU)",
