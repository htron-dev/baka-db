Having left without a trace, she considers two possible reasons: a secret affair or an accident, although she is more inclined to believe he is out committing adultery.\n\nSatoru's company The Public Baths Union aids Kanae in managing the bathhouse by sending Mr. Hori as an assistant. While handling bathhouse duties, Kanae is bombarded with appointments that may help her uncover the truth about the unexplained disappearance of Satoru.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
