Eun-ah is the only survivor of a brutal attack on her family by a deranged serial killer. She is left paralyzed from the waist down and becomes obsessed with finding and killing the person who destroyed her life. She assembles a group of outcasts, each in need of an organ transplant, with the promise that if they help her, she will give them her own organs in return.
