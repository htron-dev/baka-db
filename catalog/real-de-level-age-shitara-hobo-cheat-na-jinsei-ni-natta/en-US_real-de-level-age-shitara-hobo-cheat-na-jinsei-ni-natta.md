## Sinopse

If it is possible to "raise a level," no matter how monotonous the work, I can continue it forever.

Natsuno Taiyou. A talent that is supposedly only useful in a game, has suddenly become useful in real life?! Power was given by the fairy which allowed Taiyou to level up in real life. Immediately, he attempted to raise his level by performing monotonous work, however he ended up decreasing his charm instead!

Nevertheless, his charm level which was originally at 0 points, was actually raised to a ridiculous figure of "65535"! Taiyou is aiming to reach level 100. Furthermore he wants to fully enjoy his harem life filled with seven beautiful brides.
