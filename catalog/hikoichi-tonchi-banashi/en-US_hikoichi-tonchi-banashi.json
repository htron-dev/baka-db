    "sinopse": "Hikoichi and Osato, who are selling the many watermelons they harvested, in front of the castle, happen to meet a chief counselor named Chuemon. Chuemon was at his wits end because a messenger from a neighboring country had come to him with an unreasonable demand and he was looking for someone wise and intelligent to help him. Hikoichi agrees to help him, on the condition that Chuemon buys all of the watermelons if Hikoichi can win a battle of wits. Hikoichi makes seemingly impossible problems possible using his wits and unconventional methods. This drama rhythmically progresses with wisdom and courage.\n\n(Source: Sukugawa International Short Film Festival)",
