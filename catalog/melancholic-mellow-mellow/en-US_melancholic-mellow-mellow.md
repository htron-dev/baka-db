## Sinopse

Yuuta's kouhai Madoka used to be short, cute and agreeable but now he's just short. Without a job, constantly cheating on his girlfriends and with no place to stay, Yuuta is the only one left who's still willing to put up with Madoka's bad attitude while clinging to memory of the adorable kouhai he used to care for. However, when Madoka barges in drunk one night and coerces an unwilling Yuuta into sex will that be the straw that breaks the camel's back or will it be the start of a new relationship for the two?

Tankoubon also contains one short unrelated oneshot "Flower Shower".
