## Sinopse

Sachiko Usurai just wants an easygoing school life, and make some friends. But her head is inhabited by a strange being she refers to as "Neko-sama." A representation of her karma, in the form of a cat. These creatures that resemble animals, have been carried by humans for generations and generations; and are said to influence a person's fate.
