## Sinopse

Hououji Yuu is a high school closet otaku, and is also the sole heir of the very rich Hououji family. She needs to keep her hobbies secret from others because that would end up ruining her family name. Because of that, she has always kept her distance from maids. Until one day, she meets her personal maid Masaki, who happens to be her favourite doujinshi artist!
