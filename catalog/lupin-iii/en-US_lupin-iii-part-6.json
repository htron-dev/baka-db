    "sinopse": "His name is Lupin III. He is a gentleman thief whose grandfather was the renowned phantom thief Arsène Lupin.\n\nWhen it comes to the art of thievery, there is nothing Lupin III cannot steal; whether it be jewels, works of art, hidden treasures, the secret to immortality, or the heart of a pretty girl.\n\nLupin's partners are Daisuke Jigen, a great gunman; Goemon Ishikawa, a master swordsman; Fujiko Mine, a devilishly clever femme fatale. There is Inspector Zenigata, a relentless ICPO officer, consumed with an obsessive desire to apprehend the masterful thief.\n\n(Source: TMS Entertainment)",
