The country has fortified its border after a singer named Queen Malta got assassinated in the neighboring country of West Doroa upon visit.\n\nDespite the two countries being enemies, Lupin and Jigen still plan to steal the treasure. During the heist, Jigen almost got killed by a skilled sniper named Yael Okuzaki. His specialty is preparing tombstones for his targets before executing his kills. Its said that no one has survived after Yael makes a grave for that target.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
