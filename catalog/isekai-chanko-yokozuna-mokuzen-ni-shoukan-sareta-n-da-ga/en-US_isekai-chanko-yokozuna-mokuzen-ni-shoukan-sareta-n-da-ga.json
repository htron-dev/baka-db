    "sinopse": "The story stars two-time winning sumo wrestler Takarayama. After his successes, he believes that he'll be promoted to yokozuna, the highest rank in sumo wrestling. Instead of receiving his promotion, Takarayama finds himself summoned to another world by magician sisters Elise, Iris, and Franca, and they don't know how to send him back. In the meantime, the magical trio is hungry, so Takarayama starts making a pot of Chankonabe (a traditional stew that sumo wrestlers eat).\n\n(Source: ANN)",
