## Sinopse

After her distraught sister told her that her fiancé's older brother, Santos, wouldn’t give them his blessing to marry, Georgina decided to speak with Santos herself. The brothers' father left a will saying the first son to marry would inherit the family business, which is why Santos won't support their marriage. Georgina asked Santos to allow her sister's marriage anyway, but Santos turned her down flat. That's when she decided to propose to him. "Why don't you and I get married so that you can inherit your father's business? Then we can get divorced."
