    "sinopse": "Rather than a prince and a princess living happily ever after together, it is much more appealing to see a prince and a prince fall in love.\n\nBelieving in this wholeheartedly, Kae Serinuma is an overweight second-year high school girl who spends her days obsessing over fictional boys and fantasizing about men being in love with each other. In particular, she ships her male classmates Nozomu Nanashima and Yuusuke Igarashi—in her mind, every interaction they have hints at their romance. However, Kae's entire world is turned upside down when her favorite anime character dies. Heartbroken, she locks herself in her room and cuts off all contact from society. When she finally emerges a week later, she has slimmed down to have become a radiant beauty!\n\nNow, all the boys that Kae was content with watching from afar are suddenly pursuing her—the only problem is, Kae wants no part in it! She would much rather they kiss each other, not her. In the battle for her heart, Kae ensnares the boys in her wild fantasies and exposes them to the true nature of a fujoshi's world.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
