## Sinopse

Early in the fourth decade of the Showa Period Japan was finally recovering from the destruction of the war, and everyone was focused on nothing more than keeping themselves alive in the chaos.

Chihiro Shindo, the eccentric detective who enjoys observing, meets the beautiful yet crazy boy named Shinobu Hasama. "If you kill someone, you have to come here, don't you?" he says.
