## Sinopse

The time is the Heian Period, the place, ancient Kyoto. Rumor has it that Tomoe, the daughter of a noble, is extremely shy. She almost never goes to social gatherings at Court, preferring instead to shut herself away at home. But the truth is that Lady Tomoe makes the most of her natural gift and burning curiosity, enthusiastically writing couplets... or rather, tales of coupling, dojinshi (with the authority figure as the "top"). This is a story of a lady’s friendship and fujoshi picture scrolls.
