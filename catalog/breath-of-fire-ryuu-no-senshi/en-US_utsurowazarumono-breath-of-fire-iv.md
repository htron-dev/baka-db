## Sinopse

Nina, a wyndian princess, and her guardian Cray are searching everywhere for Nina's missing elder sister, Elina. While traveling to her last known whereabouts they suffer an accident. On her way to a nearby town, Nina meets Ryu, a seemingly amnesiac young man. This meeting triggers a series of events that will involve them with the godly race known as The Endless, immortal dragons with the power to shape the world itself.
