    "sinopse": "Tamaki is in love with Shinji. He's a spoiled, arrogant and self-centered guy and lately he's been playfully clinging and getting too close to Tamaki to deal with tension. Thinking that this can't go on, Tamaki is determined to distance himself from Shinji, but it just makes him want to see Shinji all the more....\n\nIt's a series of school love strories that will leave your heart and body throbbing.\n\n(Source: M-U)",
