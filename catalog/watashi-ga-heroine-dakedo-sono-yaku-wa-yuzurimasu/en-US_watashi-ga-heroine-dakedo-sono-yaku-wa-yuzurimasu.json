    "sinopse": "I was reborn as the heroine of a shoujo manga I had read in my previous life. Yay! That's not it! Out of everyone, I was reborn as the heroine that I hated. I don't want to be that girl, I don't want to get together with that guy that she likes either! In preparation for the high school entrance ceremony, I made a decision. I will completely avoid the hero, and make the rival character and the hero hook up. Since the high school entrance ceremony, I stealthily watched over the hero and the rival character from the shadows and saw them grinning and getting along with each other. Even though I was just gazing at them, I somehow became acquaintances with the rival character and am having tea with them right now.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
