Every candidate will be granted 100,000 peir,\nand may be employmed as a court lady or lady attendant?!\n\n\"I can be the court lady that I've always longed to be!\" Teresse thought.

Will Teresse be appointed as a court lady or will she stand out from the rest as the Prince's Consort!?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
