## Sinopse

The poor daughter of the Marquis, Teresse, who has been striving to save money day and night, was suddenly informed that she would be one of the "Prince's Consort Candidate."

"A poor aristocrat such as myself couldn't be a consort candidate!" she refuses, but... Every candidate will be granted 100,000 peir,
and may be employmed as a court lady or lady attendant?!

"I can be the court lady that I've always longed to be!" Teresse thought. And with this in mind, she decided to head to the palace as a "Prince's Consort Candidate." However, what awaits her in the palace is a war with self-indulgent young ladies and other consort candidates! Will Teresse be appointed as a court lady or will she stand out from the rest as the Prince's Consort!?
