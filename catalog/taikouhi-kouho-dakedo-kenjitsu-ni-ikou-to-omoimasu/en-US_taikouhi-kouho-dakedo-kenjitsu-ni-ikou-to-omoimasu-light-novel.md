## Sinopse

Teresse is the first daughter of a poor Marquis family. One day, she's suddenly invited to become a candidate to become the future Queen to the Prince along with plenty of other young noble women. Initially intending to refuse, Teresse is then informed that her family will receive remuneration regardless of whether she is chosen or not. In addition, she is even allowed to aim for a Court Lady position during her time. Jumping on the opportunity, Teresse now lives in the castle, avoiding conflict with the other candidates while slowly trying to better herself to earn more for her family.
