## Sinopse

Ever dream of being in a rock band? How about a GENIUS rock band? Chul, Dal Bong, Mickey, and Rae-young--four deviant misfits of society--find themselves stalked, caught, and coerced into forming the greatest boy band of the century. And it doesn't hurt that they have talent, looks, and personality.

A female detective, an heiress, a Betsy Johnson-inspired wardrobe, an evil dude, a cute evil dude, and other casts and characters all come together in this brilliant high jinks story of rock 'n roll, friends, and yes, love, that will make you wish you could have been there for the Audition.
