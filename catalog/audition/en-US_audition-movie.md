## Sinopse

A cartoon by CHUN Gye-young, which was one of the most popular cartoons in the late 1990’s, is made into an animation after 8 years of work. The film’s leading characters, with appearances typical for girls’ cartoons, are already popular as various licensed products. Four musical prodigies, who never had a chance to get a music education, meet in a band called ‘Recycled Band’. In the band, they open their minds to each other and follow their dreams in music.
