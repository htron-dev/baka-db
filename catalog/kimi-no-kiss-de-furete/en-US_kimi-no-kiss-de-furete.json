    "sinopse": "On the first day of school, before the opening ceremony, Mihane thinks she may have already found the boy of her dreams. His name is Kurose-kun, and he is a 3rd year senior. They have a rather painful meeting when Mihane falls from a fence she was climbing, and lands right on top of him. She is dazzled by his good looks. He seems nice, too, helping her up. She cheerfully lets him know about her dream of finding a great boyfriend before running off to class. He thinks she is strange, but interesting.\n\n(Source: Lovers Dream)",
