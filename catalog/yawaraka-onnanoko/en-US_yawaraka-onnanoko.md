## Sinopse

Curious co-eds, shy virgins and secret crushes are bound to get caught up when love (well, lust) is in the air! Can these cute couples make the most of their "big" moment? And will true romance actually bloom in the wake of hot-and-heavy hook-ups?

Tender Hearts teases and tempts with tales of surprising seduction and fierce flirtation! When the object of your affection actually likes you back, you've got to rise the occasion! But can these impulsive lovers keep it up when things go from warm to sizzling?
