## Sinopse

In eighteenth century Europe, in the midst of misery and oppression promoted by absolute monarchies, a philosopher dared to ask: what would be the most legitimate system of government and socially just? Analyzing the nature of man and human relations, Rousseau (1712-1778) proposed in his treatise not only a model of social organization but a new world view, that was one of the fuses for the liberal uprisings that, from French Revolution onwards, shook the entire European continent.
