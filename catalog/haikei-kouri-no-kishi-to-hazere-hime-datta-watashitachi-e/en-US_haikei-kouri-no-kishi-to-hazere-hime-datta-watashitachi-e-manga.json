    "sinopse": "The sickly and socially withdrawn Princess Ridelle fell in love with the quick-witted knight, Sir Oscar and became his wife. But after finding out that Oscar didn't wish for the marriage, their marriage life became no different than a pile of misfortunes.\n\nSoon, Ridelle was struck down by another tragedy, changing both of their lives tremendously, but...\n\nThis is the love story between a former princess who was looked down upon as \"the Failure Princess,\" and the young count known as \"the Ice Knight\"—the crossing of their paths weaving tragedies in their wake.\n\n(Source: Overlap, translated)",
