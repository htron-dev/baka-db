    "sinopse": "A year after the resolution of the fight with the Protodeviln, the band Firebomber's Mylene F. Jenius (now 16 years old) is still conflicted about her feelings for lead vocalist Nekki Basara and wavering in her strength as a musician/vocalist. Acting on her desire to be on equal footing with Basara, Mylene takes an opportunity to perform with the group Jamming Angels as lead vocalist. With a television producer holding an ulterior motive, a clandestine military project, and Basara heading off into the galaxy, this action marks the start of a path that she would never have guessed.\n\n(Source: Japanese Wikipedia)",
