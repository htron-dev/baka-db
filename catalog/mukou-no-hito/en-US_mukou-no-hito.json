    "sinopse": "Sano, who can't seem to connect with anyone at all—not his family, not his coworkers—turns to SNS instead. One day, he decides to finally meet up with one of his mutual followers, \"S.\" His Internet friend turns out to be Narumi, a handsome young actor whose popularity recently shot through the roof! Although Narumi's behavior seems to hint at something bubbling beneath the surface, Sano can't shake off the feeling that he's probably being toyed around with... An emotional, heart-piercing BL between a handsome actor and a salaryman who doesn't do communication.\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
