    "sinopse": "This book contains three separate and unusual stories set in alternate realities. The first story, \"How Martians Conquer the Earth,\" tells the tale of a young woman struggling with the sudden death of the man she loves. Can anyone ever replace him? The second tale, \"Is It Really Impossible?,\" makes you wonder if a man and a woman can truly be just friends, especially in a world where women are such a rare find. And the last of the three, \"Science Fiction Story,\" is a sad tale about a girl who hates robots and the humanoid who serves her. The creator, who believes that the best privilege artists get is to \"lie\", creates a whole new world beyond your imagination.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
