    "sinopse": "When a prince's soon-to-be-bride elopes two days before their wedding, her desperate family dress up their young son and send him to get married in her place. With his deep blue eyes and flowing blond hair (and strategically placed apples), nobody bats an eye at the pretty pubescent standing before them. But how long can he keep up the charade. Despite the odds stacked against them, the two princes share adventures and intimacies.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
