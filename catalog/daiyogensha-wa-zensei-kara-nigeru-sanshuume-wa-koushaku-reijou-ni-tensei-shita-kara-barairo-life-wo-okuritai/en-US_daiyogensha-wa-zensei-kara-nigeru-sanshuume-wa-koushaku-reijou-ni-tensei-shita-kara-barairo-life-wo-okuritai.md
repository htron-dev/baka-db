## Sinopse

A woman unpopular throughout her life, reincarnated from a female college student to a great prophet. She was born a third time as a duke's daughter, and for a moment, she happily thought, "I'll be able to live a free life!" while possessing the powers from her previous life...

Huh?! If I'm exposed, I'll be single my whole life?! I'll definitely enjoy a lady's life this time around! From the highly popular web novel comes the highly awaited serialization!
