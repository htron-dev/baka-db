## Sinopse

"You're really not cute!!!"

Akutsu is still only an underclassman but he's got all the girls' attention. Plus, not only is he good in his studies, he's also the ace of the baseball club. Even though Ida doesn't want to have anything to do with Akutsu but somehow they're often together...?

"Don't tell me he actually likes me!?"
