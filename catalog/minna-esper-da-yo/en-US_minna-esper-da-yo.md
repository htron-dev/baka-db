## Sinopse

Yoshirou has a unique ability: The ability to read people's minds. He claims that he has noticed it recently and like tuning a radio he can listen to what others are thinking. He then realizes that using his powers, he can probably save others, like Sae, who is the new transfer student who is in the same class as Yoshirou. Meanwhile, two unknown people are driving discussing about the abnormal increase of people being able to use psychic powers.

Who are these people and what is going to happen to Yoshirou?
