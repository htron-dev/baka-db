## Sinopse

Meru Kusuhara is a normal girl with an ordinary appearance, style, and grades. Therefore, she had been living a peaceful, inconspicuous high school life, but by a chance accident, the beauties of the student council called, "Reiryuu's Five Leaders," ended up taking a fancy to her. As she comes into contact with the cheat council members, her hidden abilities are revealed and Meru too, was thrust into the student council.

With Reiryuu Academy as the stage, the ordinary girl chock-full of secrets together with the genius boys chock-full of beauty will lead a dokidoki-filled and at times heartrending, everyday-life-type school story!
