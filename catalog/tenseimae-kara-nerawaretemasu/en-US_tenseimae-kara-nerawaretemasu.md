Renellette is the beautiful daughter of a Count, with a position, an education, and enough property befitting her status, yet somehow she can't get married. One day, while searching for a marriage partner, she meets a man who rekindles memories of her past lives, a stalker who interferes with her marriage every time Renellete reincarnates! She struggles to shake off the obstacles between her and a happy marriage in this life, but his shadow is always flickering behind her...
