## Sinopse

She might risk her heart for Jacob, but she won't risk her child.

Two years have passed since KC's affair with Jacob, a rich businessman, came to an end. No one would've thought that Jacob, the CEO of a large company in Philadelphia, would return to their small town. Back when KC was pregnant with Jacob's child, his grandfather forced her to cut ties with Jacob in exchange for money. He even had the temerity to order her to get an abortion. Back then KC fled town, only returning after she learned of the grandfather's death. Now Jacob has run into KC and her child, and he has questions!
