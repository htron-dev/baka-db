In a world where the Fiends run rampant...

But due to the twists and turns of fate surrounding his status as the No. 1 Magicmaster in the nation—the top Magicmaster out of more than 100,000—he ends up as a student at a special magical institute, hiding his identity and training his successors – a pair of beautiful Magicmaster girls! Not to mention continuing to defeat Fiends in secret... Get ready—the epic adventure of the Greatest Magicmaster Alus Reigin begins now!
