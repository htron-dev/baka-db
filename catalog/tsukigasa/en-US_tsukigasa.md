## Sinopse

When a man is found lying unconcious beside a river he is carried back to a house. There they call for the doctor (Azuma) to come and take a look at his wounds.

Azuma himself has problems with touching other people. Why can't he allow some people to touch him at all?

The man ends up being one from Azuma's past. He is now a wanted criminal. Can Azuma prevent him from going to prison?

(from B-U)
