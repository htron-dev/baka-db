## Sinopse

Takamaru Mai has been having continuous dreams of seeing a dark, deep pit, snakes, and blood. After being in a car accident and only suffering from a mild concussion, her x-ray results showed a strange image—a hand was grabbing her skull. Mai then begins to believe that she was seeing things that she shouldn't be seeing.
