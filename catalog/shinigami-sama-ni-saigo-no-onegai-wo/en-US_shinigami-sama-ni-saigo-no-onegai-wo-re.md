## Sinopse

Aida Shizuka was sentenced to death for murdering his whole family. As he waited for his execution to come, he was one day visited by his sister who was no longer of the living and had become a grim reaper. The two of them set up to perform the grim reaper's job of granting the "final wish", but they would soon realise that Shizuka was not the culprit behind their family's murder. What lies before them is a revenge suspense story basked in the ever-changing lies and truth.
