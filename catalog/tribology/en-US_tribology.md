## Sinopse

A humorous story centered around the life of a girl named Hinatsu Nose, an undergraduate student in the Department of Engineering. Just as she is entering her senior year of college and is applying to join a research lab, her friends start talking to her more about love and she becomes curious about having relationships with guys. Since Hinatsu is a material science nerd who has an unhealthy obsession with melting and molding metal, it surprises everyone when she suddenly takes interest in a guy she meets in a lab. Will love continue to be a side thought for Hinatsu?
