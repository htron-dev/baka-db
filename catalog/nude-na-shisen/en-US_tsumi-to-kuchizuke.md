   When a gentle young man named Yamato is sent to the lush Fiji islands (in place of his brother, Hikaru), it proves to be the perfect setting for passion as he tumbles into an affair with a world class F1 race-car driver, Kyle, who is his brother's (ex-)lover.

   Higurashi (Hikaru) gets kissed by Aaron, a famous lady-killer and F1 racer (on the same team as Kyle) and then "kidnapped" (with Yamato's help) to a desert island for their "honeymoon". Will Hikaru believe in Aaron's love?
