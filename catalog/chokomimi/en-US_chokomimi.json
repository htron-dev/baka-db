Choco is studious and hard-working while Mimi is a spoiled and imaginative free-spirit, yet both of them have the same flair for fashion and desire to look cute. Following them on their journey through junior high school are their friends, Ryunosuke \"Andrew\" Ando, Komei Mikami, Mumu Momoyama, and Kojika \"Bambi\" Mori. The six of them put their own unique spin on romance, school, and life in general.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
