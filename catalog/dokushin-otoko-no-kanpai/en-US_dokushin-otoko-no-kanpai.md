## Sinopse

Businessman Jarrett travels to Canada in order to secure the purchase of a business. There he meets his newly married friend and his wife, and agrees to join them for dinner. He is introduced to a former model, Abbie. Jarrett falls in love at first sight, but her suspicious behavior leads him to assume she is a high-class escort. But her true identity is even more surprising! (Source: Jmanga)
