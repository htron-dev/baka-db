    "sinopse": "In an era of space travel, there is a small restaurant in Jupiter's orbit named after its owner, Motoka. People coming to or leaving the stars come through her small restaurant, and she always has something to serve that speaks to her customers' hearts and memories.\n\nSome may say that the universe itself conspires for the curious encounters to happen at the tiny asteroid, it being in the proverbial fringe between the pale blue dot and the space beyond for the travelers, who while visiting find answers that they may have not been looking for, but whose questions lingered in silent vigilance, ever present in the back of their minds.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
