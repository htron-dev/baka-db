## Sinopse

A girl with bloody iron pipes, sleepy eyes flickering—just talk.

"On the Islands, a gunshot echoes today. As usual. People die. As usual. Dogs and more dogs, the dogs, well, kill each other. As usual. The Bosses of the eastern sections, transform. As usual. A fellow murderer, using swords and the eastern sections of the cat, the brother Li Feng, the detective brother, cute guys, clumsy love. As usual. The Island, I'm terribly confused. ...as always. After all, as usual. The island today is As Usual. That's it. So I, as always, the cute child, hug a lot. It's warm. I'm... sleepy"
