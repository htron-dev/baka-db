## Sinopse

General Course student Kadokura spends his days stressfully looking after the Sports Course students who live in his house, at his father's (their coach) behest. Although he doesn't get along with the athletics ace Kima, after a meaningful conversation one night, he kisses Kadokura.

This is an alternate story to Junketsu Drop.
