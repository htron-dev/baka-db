## Sinopse

"Is this what sex is?!"

An English nobleman, Earl Christopher (33 years old), lives a systematic and routine life. Due to his methodical way of life, he has been isolated from the living world and does not even know what sex is... One morning, Christopher comes upon a man camping in his territory. Because of Kanamori, a Japanese gardener, part of his territory has been unexpectedly turned into a Japanese garden with a water fountain! Kanamori expresses his liking to the enraged Christopher and suddenly pushes him down...

A nobleman's first time and a barbaric Japanese man in a field of grass!
