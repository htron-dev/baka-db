## Sinopse

The oldest brother's co-worker, Akiyoshi-san, is a great older beauty. Hokuto, the baby of the family, who fell in love with him at first sight, isn't going to give up until he makes this big man fall for him! On the other hand the second son, Nishiya, is being moved both body and soul by Hokuto's homeroome teacher, Fuyuno-sensei...!?
