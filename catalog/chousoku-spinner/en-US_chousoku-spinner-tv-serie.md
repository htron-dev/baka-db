## Sinopse

Despite being talented in various sports, Shunichi Domoto is not passionate about any of them in particular—that is, until he discovers the world of competitive yo-yo.

It all begins when Shunichi's friend, Beso Kimura, loses his yo-yo in a duel against the school bully, Benkei Musashimaru. Albeit inexperienced, Shunichi eventually agrees to help Beso retrieve his yo-yo. After practicing for three days, Shunichi challenges and unexpectedly defeats the relatively skilled Benkei.

Shunichi's win instills the belief that the yo-yo is easy to master, and that he is ultimately able to easily master anything he puts his mind to. However, after losing to the exceptionally gifted yo-yo player Seito Hojoin, Shinichi finds his ego shattered. As the humiliating loss ignites a spark in Shunichi, he decides to surpass Seito in Japan's national Yo-yo Championship!
