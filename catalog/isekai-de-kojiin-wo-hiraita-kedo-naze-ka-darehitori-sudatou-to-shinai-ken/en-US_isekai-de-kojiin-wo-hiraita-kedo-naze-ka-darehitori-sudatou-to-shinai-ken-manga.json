    "sinopse": "From a caste based high school, bottom-tier Shinji Naomi is caught up in a summoning of his class to a different world. However, as soon as they arrived the king deemed him as unnecessary, because of his clumsy skills he has received, and forces him into administering an orphanage, which no one wants to do. Unfortunately, for the orphanage, his skills were cheat skills that cause the girls to cling to him.\n\nIn order to \"defend\" the girls that depend on him, he must operate the orphanage while overcoming the powerful people, authorities, and former classmates that surround him.\n\n(Source: MU, edited)",
