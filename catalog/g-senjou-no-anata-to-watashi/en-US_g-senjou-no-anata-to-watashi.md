## Sinopse

The manga centers on Yaeko Kogure, a woman who resigned from her company due to plans for marriage, only to have her fiancé break up with her on her last day. Confused and angry, she passes by a store that is playing Johann Sebastian Bach's iconic "Air" piece. Moved by the piece, she begins taking violin lessons for adults in the hopes of being able to play it.
