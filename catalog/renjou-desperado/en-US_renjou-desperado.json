    "sinopse": "Her name is Monko. A solitary crow, a wandering soul, a magnificent traveler who roams the roads that are inhabited by bloodthirsty bandits and attractive young people, some of whom are one and the same. At the heart of this wild hinterland where dangerous creatures arise, Monko follows the path she has taken. Despite her devotion to the way of the sword, it is not the warriors path she chose to pursue. In spite of her intelligence, she does not seek wisdom either.\n\nIndeed, the quest she pursues is to find the perfect husband. Her path is the way of love.\n\n(Source: Manga Rock)",
