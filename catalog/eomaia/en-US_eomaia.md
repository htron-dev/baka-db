## Sinopse

13-year-old Haru has just moved to a new neighborhood, where the houses all seem similar at night. While out at the convenience store at a late hour, she runs into a classmate who strikes up a conversation with her, offering to be her guide so she doesn't get lost. To their utter surprise, they witness what seems to be a meteorite falling into the reservoir, just like what they were talking about as seen on the news.

The next morning, Haru discovers there's something weird with herself...
