## Sinopse

The familiar scents of gunpowder and kitty litter... When hardened men with a soft spot for felines look for a haven, they come to Kitty and Me, a bar with a select clientele and one ironclad rule: When inside, do not dare harm the cats that call it home. Here, the hitman known as Undertaker finds himself in the unenviable situation of mourning the recent loss of his beloved pet, Cheriko...and discovering that his next target is a fellow cat lover. But the concrete jungle isn't always so courteous as to wait outside, and the bloody truth about Undertaker's latest job is knocking at the door.
