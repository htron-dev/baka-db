## Sinopse

Yuusuke is a high-schooler afraid of being branded differently from others. To date, he's had nothing more than casual relationships. Shin is afraid of losing the people he loves. To date, he has not had a serious relationship with anyone.

Kenji is a cop who has a inferiority complex when compared to his honor student brother and his lover, Misonou, a novelist.

A certain incident brings these four people together. This is an adult love story about the emotions of different people who harbor feelings of loneliness in their hearts.
