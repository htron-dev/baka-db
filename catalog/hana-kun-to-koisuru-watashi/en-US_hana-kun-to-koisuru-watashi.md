## Sinopse

Responsible class president Nanase Sakashita couldn't be more different than the class-cutting loner, Hana-kun. But when he saves her from a pushy classmate, the two strike up an unlikely friendship. Nanase is determined to help set him straight and keep him in school, and Hana-kun is equally determined to show her there's a life outside the classroom. Will the two be able to overcome their differences?
