## Sinopse

Kurama Wakamiya is a closet gay who is in charge of the stage costumes for the theater club at his university. He has been constantly visualizing about being held by a man, particularly being physically violated by his junior club member named Kirishima. Kirishima is a son of the huge fabric business family who supplies the cloths for the costume production in their club; he is also known as a ghost member since he rarely comes and joins club activities. That is the beginning of the story between the closet gay Kurama and the mysterious Kirishima, who are both labeled as outstandingly hot guys at their university.
