## Sinopse

Exotic, smart and lethal, Number Nine is a field operative for an organization committed to fighting injustice. Little is known about "Ultimate Blue" except that they're the last line of defense against battalions of terrorists and criminals. Even less is known about its field operatives—though it's whispered that they possess the ability to change the course of world history. And Number Nine is one of them.
