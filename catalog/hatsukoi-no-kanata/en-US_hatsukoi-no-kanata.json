    "sinopse": "My first love wasn't granted. Because the person I loved was my father’s lover. Because I wasn’t able to let go of that love, I went out with those who are older and flirty. However, once, my university friend, Shinri showed me a face which intrigued me.\n\n\"Anyway it won’t be granted.\"\n\nMy heart skipped whenever the always optimistic Shinri showed me the expression of giving up on love. That one side of Shinri which I had not known, made a fuss in my chest.\n\n—I, perhaps like this guy.\n\n(Source: MU)",
