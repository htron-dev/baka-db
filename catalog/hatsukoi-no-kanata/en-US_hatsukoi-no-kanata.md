## Sinopse

My first love wasn't granted. Because the person I loved was my father’s lover. Because I wasn’t able to let go of that love, I went out with those who are older and flirty. However, once, my university friend, Shinri showed me a face which intrigued me.

"Anyway it won’t be granted."

My heart skipped whenever the always optimistic Shinri showed me the expression of giving up on love. That one side of Shinri which I had not known, made a fuss in my chest.

—I, perhaps like this guy.
