With the third-years having graduated and incoming first-years entering the school, alliances are well underway. Additionally, now that Nagumo Miyabi is the student council president, the promise of turning the school into a meritocracy may become a reality.\n\nMeanwhile, conflicts between classes continue to build as the class point totals draw close.
