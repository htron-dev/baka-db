## Sinopse

The term "femme fatale," or "deadly woman," is a stereotype of an alluring woman who charms her lover into an insatiable desire for her, and draws them into dangerous situations. Its Japanese translation means "the fated woman." In this thrilling romance, Saitou Hajime joins a club at his college and meets the "femme fatale," Yukari Ebisawa, a graduate student who loves donuts and has quite a quirky personality—and a boyfriend. However, their relationship soon becomes complicated, interfering with their friends, work, and club duties...
