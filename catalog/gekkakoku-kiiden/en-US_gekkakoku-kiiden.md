Whether it be for illness or injury, the doctor's medicinal bath was the glory of the Moon Flower Kingdom. During the Crown Prince's Keiun's regional inspection, right in front of Keiun's eyes, a shocking "suture surgery" was successfully completed by a young girl named Koyou!

A conspiracy flying around, suspicious beliefs, and deep rooted traditions... Together with reassuring friends, Medical Doctor Koyou, and Crown Prince Keiun will confront various challenges and deal with their country's national disaster! This is a Chinese-styled imperial medicine fantasy!
