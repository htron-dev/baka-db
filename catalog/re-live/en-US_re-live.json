    "sinopse": "In the future, the government \"recycles\" dangerous criminals instead of executing them. Their memories are erased, their personalities are replaced, and they are sent back to their original life as a new person. With this process, there is an extremely low rate of repeat offenders.\n\nKou has just gone home to his big sister after receiving his punishment for committing murder. He has a little notebook to use in the absence of his memory, which details his life and relationships. However, his friends at school seem to doubt that he's actually the perpetrator. Will Kou be able to uncover the truth behind the murder he is believed to have committed? With no knowledge of his previous life, how can he tell who to trust?\n\n(Source: MU)",
