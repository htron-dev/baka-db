## Sinopse

Kisara Amou is a celebrity, so she's often too busy with work to go to school, and worries about her total lack of friends. On her first day of high school, she meets Tachibana Hinako, the only person at school who doesn't know about her, and thus is the only one to treat her normally. Thus, she quickly becomes Kisara's first friend.
