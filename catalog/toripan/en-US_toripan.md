## Sinopse

Toripan is a semi-autobiographical gag series that alternates between a short story and 4-koma formats. Following suit, the art style can be very detailed at times, but usually it's more crude and sketchy. Just about everything revolves around Nanko's observations of, and interactions with, the birds in her neighborhood, although she does occasionally talk about visiting an old village, or venturing into the mountains to pick mushrooms. It's a pro-environment manga, and it's pretty clear that Nanko likes her subjects a lot.
