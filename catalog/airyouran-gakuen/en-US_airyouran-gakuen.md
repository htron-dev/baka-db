## Sinopse

In the all-boys school, Blooming Love Academy, there’s a super-elite group where gorgeous guys flock in unrestrained abundance, the GLG (Gorgeous-Looking Guys). Even the people off-campus have heard of them. One fateful day during the preparation of the school’s Christmas party, Echizen Makoto encounters the tall, handsome Fujimiya. Will the ordinary-looking Makoto ever have a chance to make his wish come true…?
