## Sinopse

Contains the three chapters of Kiss Players serialised in Dengeki Daioh between August and November 2006, and the 26 single-page 15 Go! Go! strips serialised in Hobby Japan between July 2005 and September 2007.

Kiss Players
Faced with the possibility of her own demise, the timid Atari Hitotonari makes a decision that will change her life and ends up becoming a "Kiss Player", one of a few human females that, through a quirk of fate, gained the ability to fuse with giant robots and fight suggestive creepy lecherous robots and monsters.

15 Go! Go!
The series mainly follows the (mis)adventures of Teletraan 15, charged by the mysterious "Kurohy≈ç Man" ("Black Panther Man") to traverse time and space, gathering data on the Transformers. As she does, her friend Teletraan 10 provides snarky commentary on the Cybertronians she meets. Towards the end of the run, the comic took a side-trip to follow the events of the Kiss Players as they too traveled across the dimensions.
