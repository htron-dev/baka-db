## Sinopse

Two competing restaurants stand across the street from each other: The Oden restaurant called Yukie, and the rice-based restaurant called Meshiya. The owners of these restaurants, Asakura Yukie and Yanagawa Gengorou, also seem to have some kind of long-standing feud. This is most unfortunate for their children, Sakura and Shin, who have fallen in love. The two of them meet for secret romantic trysts, dreaming of the day when they can marry and build a restaurant with both oden and rice. This will only become a reality, though, if they can reconcile whatever is standing between their parents and finally gain approval for their love!
