    "sinopse": "Yuri doesn't have any friends because of her personality. One day, the famous Fujiwara talks to her, but Yuri thinks that she's nothing but a fake person. Shinobu, her childhood friend and only friend, writes a story for a doujinshi which Yuri would do the art. On the story, the main character resembles Fujiwara a lot, but with a twisted personality. On that same day, Yuri sees the real Fujiwara and, as she had suspected, that girl wasn't so lovely as she appeared.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: First Love (Koi Zome); First Love, After That",
