## Sinopse

Wataru, who has nowhere to go after his track-and-field dream gets torn apart, stumbles upon an old movie theater wandering about and carelessly breaks the movie projector...

Together with the bewitching, handsome manager Shuuhei and the young boss, Rinne, he vows to fill the empty theater!

Connecting people one by one with movies, a warm comedy about humanity opens its curtains!
