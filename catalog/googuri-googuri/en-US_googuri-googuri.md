## Sinopse

"Googuri Googuri" - a made up word, a secret word, shared by a girl and her grandfather. For the girl, her grandfather is at times like a mountain, at other times like a tree, or an ocean; a warm and comfortable place. Her thoughts take wing into her endless imagination. The things we have seen, smelled, thought, and everything we have experienced, extending and expanding within the infinite expanse inside ourselves.
