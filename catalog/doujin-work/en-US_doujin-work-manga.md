## Sinopse

A 4-koma style strip that follows Najimi Osana and her friends adventures in doujin—that is to say drawing (often perverted) fan comics. Najimi decides to join the "circle" as a doujin artist herself once she realizes how profitable it can be, but she soon realizes it's harder than it seems.
