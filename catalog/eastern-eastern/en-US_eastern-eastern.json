    "sinopse": "The first two stories, which give the name to the volume (Eastern Eastern 1 and 2), tell the tale of the historic moment in which Japan became ...\"occidental,\" through the eyes of a young boy who cherished real men, the samurai of the past. The third story, UMA: Unbelievable Mountain Angel, is a \"walk\" through the mountains that will take the two protagonists to meet the Bigfoot, Chupacabra, Ufo and more, in a funny \"animated\" adventure.",
