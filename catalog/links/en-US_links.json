    "sinopse": "Getting together is never easy, but even once two people are in a relationship, it can be impossible to describe what they mean to each other. Lovers do not always love each other, love and hate are not mutually exclusive, and friendship is akin to love but with ill-defined boundaries.\n\nFor eight paired-off men—Ryou Shibata and Masahito Sekiya, Yahiko Tsubame and Akiha Niitsu, Aoi Kameda and Yuusei Ogikawa, Takaaki Sado and Shinobu Nakajou—the answer to what their partner thinks of them is frustratingly elusive. Apart from this common dilemma that unites them, it gradually becomes clear that the couples are linked in more ways than one.\n\n[Source My Anime List]"
