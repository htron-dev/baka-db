## Sinopse

Life is rough for Chihaya... and she does her best. Happiness? Never heard of it. With her mother gone and her father an alcoholic, she does odd jobs to make ends meet. One day, her foot accidentally bumps into the cane of Ichitarou, a blind man. From that moment on, Ichitarou, with an infectious joy of life, will do everything he can to enter Chihaya's life and make her see the world differently.
