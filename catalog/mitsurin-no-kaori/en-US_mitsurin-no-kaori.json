    "sinopse": "Based on Elda Minger's novel \"Untamed Heart\"\n\nShe could soothe a jungle tiger, but not his untamed heart .... Lions and tigers were a part of Samantha Collins's life-style. As a trainer living in Hollywood, California, Samantha was used to working with exotic animals in lush locales. Her love for large cats and wild beasts brings her to Puerto Rico, when she gets word about a troublesome tiger on a film set. She flies to join the crew immediately--despite the rumors about the skirt-chasing reputation of the movie director, Ryan Fitzgerald. Samantha never expected to have to tame Ryan's savage soul--or find herself in a situation as hot as the jungle's tropical climate!\n\n(Source: Fiction DB)",
