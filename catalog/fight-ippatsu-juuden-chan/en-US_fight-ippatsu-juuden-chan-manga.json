Her clumsiness always gets her into trouble and she is constantly in danger of having her salary cut due to her performance. One day, she meets a young teenager that makes her realize that revitalizing people mindlessly is just a temporary remedy and does not solve the root cause of the problem. She then slowly begins to see the importance of timing the revitalization. However, her new aim is the exact opposite of the company policy and her boss sends Aresta to supervise her. Will she be able to keep from losing her job?\n\n(Source: MU)",
