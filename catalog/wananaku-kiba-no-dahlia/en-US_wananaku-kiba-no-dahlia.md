## Sinopse

Human and wolf. Lord and vassal. Despite all the differences, love still bloomed.

Prince Nikolaus' parents, the King and the Queen, were murdered during the rebellion between beasts and humans. He lost everything and was captured. Travis, a mere vassal, betrayed his own people and risked his life to save the prince.
