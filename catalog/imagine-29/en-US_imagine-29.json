Instead he dumps her by phone right before their date. As she's home trying to understand what has happened her younger sister whom she hasn't seen in 18 years shows upâ€¦\n\nMinori couldn't be more different from her older sister.

Just what effect will Minori's appearance have on Shimako's love life? Or is it the other way around?\n\n(Source: MU)",
