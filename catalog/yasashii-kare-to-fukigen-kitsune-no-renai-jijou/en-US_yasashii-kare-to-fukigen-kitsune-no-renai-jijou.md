## Sinopse

Ever since he got lost as a child, Keita has been able to see ayakashi after being granted the "sight." Now a working adult, Keita still sees people who would be considered normal human beings to others as something beyond human imagination. At a cafe, Keita sees a man who has fox ears and a tail. Surprised to see a male fox, Keita ends up on his bad side. However, the kind boy and the moody shape-shifting fox have many more days ahead of them.
