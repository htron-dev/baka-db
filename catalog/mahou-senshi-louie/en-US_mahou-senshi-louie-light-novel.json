    "sinopse": "When an all-female adventuring team needs a mage, the only one they can get on short notice is the burly adopted son of the head of the local mage guild. Not only does Louie look more like a fighter than a mage, he acts like it, too, getting into all manner of trouble and trying to solve it with his fists. And when the team's cleric learns that her god has assigned to her a special relationship with Louie, well, let's just say she's less than happy.",
