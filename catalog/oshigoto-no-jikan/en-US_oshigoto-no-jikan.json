    "sinopse": "Kenshiro and Ryoma are two different polarity types of president! Which one of them is the befitting heir to the Ichinomori Group? I, Kitayama Eita, must infiltrate their respective companies to determine just that! Even if it means I am subjected to sexual harassment, cosplay, and more. What I didn’t expect was for my treacherous body to actually respond to both of them! “Oh, you’re extremely sensitive,” gleed Ryoma. “I’ll train you thoroughly to my deal type,” promised Kenshiro.\n\n(Source: Fantasyshrine)",
