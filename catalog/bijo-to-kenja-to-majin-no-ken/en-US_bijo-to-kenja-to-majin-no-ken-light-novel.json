    "sinopse": "After falling into the gap between worlds, I gained “the ability to identify something’s status” for the cost of a single limitation. However, other than this skill I was completely ordinary. All I could do after landing in a strange world, was see through the status of things and use that information for my own growth. One day, after being assaulted by enemies, a lone figure appeared and saved my life. What’s more, that person had an incredible “secret”.\n\n(Source: MU)",
