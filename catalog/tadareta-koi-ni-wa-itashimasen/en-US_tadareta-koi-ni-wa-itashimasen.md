## Sinopse

On his first day living alone in Tokyo, Kyouhei Miyazawa, a university student who came from the countryside, encounters Tomohiro Takara, a debauched playboy that lives next door. Takara enjoys poking fun at him for being a country boy though, which makes Miyazawa feel self-conscious around city people.

One day, Miyazawa accepts an invitation to Takara's house and warms up to him a little after experiencing his kindness. During the visit, however, Miyazawa mistakes a condom wrapper for a piece of chewing gum...!? Takara asks, "Do you want me to put it on you?", and begins to tease Miyazawa's lower body. Suddenly a love story between a pure country boy and a city boy that likes to tease begins!
