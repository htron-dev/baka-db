But when a mysterious man burns down his garden and home, the protagonist barely manages to escape alive. When he wakes up in the hospital, he learns he has lost his eyesight. With nothing left, the man just lies in the hospital bed with seemingly no hope left, until the sudden regaining of his eyesight causes him to realise he has been transported to a strange new world covered in a mystical forest.",
