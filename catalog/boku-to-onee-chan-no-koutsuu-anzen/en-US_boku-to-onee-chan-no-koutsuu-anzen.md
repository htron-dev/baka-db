## Sinopse

Two extremely short episodes about an older sister and younger sister teaching traffic safety rules. This OVA is aimed at toddlers so extremely simple dialogue as well as its short length are meant to cater to the attention span of such young children. Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. paid for the creation of this anime and donated most copies to libraries all over Japan.
