## Sinopse

Ichito is in love with his best friend Yoshifumi from high school and can't stop fantasizing about how a confession scenario would play out. Being a manga artist, he has drawn these scenarios and treasures them greatly, hoping to one day be able to follow through. One day his drawings end up in the hands of no other than Yoshifumi!
