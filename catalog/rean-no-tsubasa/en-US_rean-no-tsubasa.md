## Sinopse

Because his friends fired a rocket into the US Army camp, Suzuki was wanted by the US Army and the police. While he was running away the sea surface suddenly rose, and when a brilliant light appeared he saw a strange looking battleship flying in the air. He was dumped into the sea and when he crawled onto the battleship there was a beautiful girl standing there. She said her name was Luxe, the princess of another world, and added; “My Father is Japanese, Shinjiro Sakomizu. Please help me, Suzuki”.
