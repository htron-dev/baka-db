## Sinopse

After the sudden loss of his father, Duke Alphonse Varney took over the affairs of his estate, which necessitated putting his mansion on the market to repay his sizeable debts. One of Alphonse’s classmates from his boarding school days, businessman Richard Turner, announced that he was interested in buying the mansion. Richard had reason to dislike Alphonse, which made Alphonse all the more unable to hide his opposition to Richard’s unexpected proposal, but in reality, there were hidden feelings between the two. This is a classical love romance collection set in polite English society.
