## Sinopse

Lauraris Eldanus ruled the country with an iron fist. The end to her reign of terror came by the hand of a hero...or so it should have been. However, three hundred years later, the former empress makes her grand reappearance in the form of a young maiden. And yet, the person inside is the same old granny?! Apparently, God gave her a second chance as thanks for the peace that was brought about by her own death.

With her second chance, she desires a peaceful life, and yet the world seems to still be filled with one bad apple after another. This is the long-awaited comicalization of the exhilarating fantasy of the strongest girl who can't overlook evil!
