    "sinopse": "The manga centers on 23-year-old graduate student Tetsurou, who lives alone in his apartment in Tokyo. His apartment is in a 41-year-old, two-story building that is five minutes away from the nearest train station by foot. The series focuses Tetsurou his daily life, as he monologues about such topics as the report that is nearing its deadline, his bitterness in making a mistake at his part-time job, agonizing whether or not he'll ask out the girl he likes, or bantering with his friends via text. Tetsurou is the only character that appears, and his room is the only setting, but sometimes his furniture or electronics will quip during his monologues.\n\n(Source: ANN)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 6: Tashikame ni Ikou",
