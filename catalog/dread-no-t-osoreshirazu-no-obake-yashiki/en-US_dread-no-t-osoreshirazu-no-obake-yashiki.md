## Sinopse

Shiori is job hunting when she receives a sudden part-time job offer from a man in front of the station. She gets in a taxi but suddenly starts to feel very sleepy. When she wakes up, she is in an eerie locked room. It seems she is stuck in a horrific situation, but it turns out the man works for a team of haunted house designers.
