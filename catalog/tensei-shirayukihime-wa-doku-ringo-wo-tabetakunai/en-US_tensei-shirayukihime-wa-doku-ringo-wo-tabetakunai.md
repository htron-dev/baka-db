## Sinopse

When she was five years old, Snow White recalled her past life as a Japanese high schooler who knew of a fairy tale about a queen who wanted the death of a princess with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony—and realizes that she has reincarnated as that princess! Ever since then, she has been training in hopes of avoiding the grim future that awaits her.

On the day of reckoning, Snow White escapes the castle before the queen calls for the hunter... only to fall onto the man himself! Will the reincarnated Snow White be able to avoid her deadly fate in this isekai spin of the classic fairy tale?
