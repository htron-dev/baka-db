Unlucky man Kiryuu was at a loss. He went to jail in place of his aniki, and when he was back, the group was long gone. Since then, he got entangled with weird people, his electricity was cut off, and finally he ran over a man. Mita, the accident's victim, is a handyman. Kiryuu decided to take care of Mita to apologize for injuring him. However, after a while, disturbing signs began to surround Mita...?
