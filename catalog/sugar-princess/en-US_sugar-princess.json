    "sinopse": "When Maya Kurinoki takes her little brother to the local ice-skating rink for the first time, she's got her hands full just trying to get him to let go of the bar. To inspire a bit of bravery in him, she attempts a double axel-and lands it! Maya never imagined that this jump would change her life... or that a coach named Eishi Todo would vow to make her a figure skating \"princess\"! Now all Maya has to do is convince famous skater Shun Kano to become her partner. Too bad Shun doesn't want to have anything to do with her!\n\n(Source: Shojo Beat)",
