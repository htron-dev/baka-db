## Sinopse

On top of being bad at studying, Misato, a grade 9 student, has bad luck with her love life as well. This is a story about this girl’s fresh first love.

Volume 2 also contains two side stories. They are:

• Kokoro ni Sotto Sasayaite (Whipering Softly in My Heart)
"Suzuna is the basketball manager and an ordinary high school girl. But you wouldn’t guess at it because she’s short and has a cute baby face like an elementary student. Which doesn’t sound so bad until she hears that her crush, Yuuji-senpai, only looks at her as a little sister because of her cute appearance. How will she be able to make Yuuji-senpai look at her not as a sister?"

• Mahou wo Kakete (Cast Your Magic)
Natsumi is the president of her class but she feels as if her classmates only view her as a nerd and so she distances herself from them. Well, until the boy she hates, Sawada, suddenly declares that they were to go shopping together. Sawada is everything that she is not; energetic, always having fun and is very friendly. What will happen to our introverted president? A story about a caterpillar emerging from its lonely cocoon!
