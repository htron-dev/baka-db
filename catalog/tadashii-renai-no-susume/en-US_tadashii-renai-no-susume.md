## Sinopse

Takeda Hiroaki is a good-looking average high school student with a cute girlfriend. Gokokuji Akira is a class president and smart on the outside but behind that elite appearance, he works for male escort company "M Project".

Though out Hiroaki's whole life, he didn't have any hobbies or didn't care about getting involved in anything. One day, his lazy everyday life turned 180 degrees when he got involved with Akira.
