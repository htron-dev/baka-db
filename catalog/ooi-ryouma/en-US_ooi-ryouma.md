## Sinopse

Ryouma Sakamoto is a coward and a crybaby who is a daily victim of bullying from the neighborhood children. To top it all off, his poor educational performance earns him a one-way ticket out of his cram school. But beneath the clumsiness and faults lies an equally strong and kind heart. Upon the murder of his mother his kindness becomes his strength and he decides that he wants to become stronger.
