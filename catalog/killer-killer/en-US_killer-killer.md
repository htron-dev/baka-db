## Sinopse

The story takes place in 2018 Tokyo. The city is one day attacked and invaded by "Errors", humans who have gone mad and kill citizens. To exterminate these Errors, the selected boys and girls are trained to become soldiers called MT (Mistilteinn). The manga is a stylish blood-action story about the young soldiers' tragic battles. Mahiro Tokura, who has been quarantined and trained to become an Error-killing soldier, meets other young soldiers who have also gone through training.
