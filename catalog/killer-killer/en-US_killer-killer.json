To exterminate these Errors, the selected boys and girls are trained to become soldiers called MT (Mistilteinn). The manga is a stylish blood-action story about the young soldiers' tragic battles. Mahiro Tokura, who has been quarantined and trained to become an Error-killing soldier, meets other young soldiers who have also gone through training.\n\n(Source: Manga Tokyo)",
