Sakai Kazuya is a 23-year-old man in love. Unfortunately, the object of his affection is a lovely woman only interested in well educated men. Sakai never finished high school and has been living off of his brawn, not his brains. So he enlists the help of her younger brother, Izumi Masashi, to help him pass the high school entrance exam, his first step toward to becoming a well-educated man. Izumi is happy to help, but his services come with a very steep fee. And, Izumi isn't interested in money, he has his sights on some of Sakai's other assets...
