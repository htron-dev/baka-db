The girl next door is his childhood friend Haju, is in love with him, but he has fallen head over heels for the school idol Riko. And lastly, there is the transfer student, Nodoka. With that all said you'd think this is the start of some love-comedy harem, but a rumor spreads that Nodoka's received a message that says, \"you will die soon.\" Riku and the gang's fate will change in a major way. Who will live, and who will love?\n\n(Source: MU)",
