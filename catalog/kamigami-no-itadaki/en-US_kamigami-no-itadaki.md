## Sinopse

In 1924, mountaineers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine attempted a daring challenge: to be the first to scale Mount Everest. However, they disappeared during the final stages of their trek, leading to one of mountaineering's greatest mysteries—did the pair ever make it to the summit?

1993, Kathmandu. Japanese photographer Makoto Fukamichi discovers a vintage camera in an antique store, which he believes might have belonged to Mallory. However, the camera falls into the possession of "Bikha Sanp", a burly Japanese man who Fukamichi realizes may very well be Jouji Habu, a legendary Japanese mountaineer who disappeared from the scene several years ago. Unfortunately for Fukamichi however, Bikha Sanp refuses to talk to him and leaves with the camera in tow.

With the trail gone cold, Fukamichi has only one course left to pursue: to delve into Habu's past, and see just what may have brought the former climber to Nepal. For the sake of rewriting mountaineering history, Fukamichi begins his investigation, a task that will bring him to the greatest height in the world—the summit of the gods.
