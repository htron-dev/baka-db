Although he misses the airplane, Kenichi manages to cling to the plane's rudder, but eventually falls into the sea and dies. But according to the ledger in heaven, it was not Kenichi's fate to die this way. So, he tried to go back into his body, but he could not find it anywhere. Taken by a guide from heaven named Halloween, Kenichi follows Higeoyaji while looking for a body to slip into. Shanghai, India, Egypt, Italy, France, America... Kenichi and Higeoyaji continue their unexpected and eventful journey while exploring the mysteries of the world.\n\n(Source: Tezuka Osamu Official)",
