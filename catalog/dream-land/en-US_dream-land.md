## Sinopse

Tomoki Okumura is a young man who is kicked out of his apartment. Looking for a job he spots an ad for an assistant position. He meets a man, Niwa, for the interview but soon finds out that this isn't your normal interview nor is Niwa your normal porn director. A story of firsts for both the naive and the experienced.
