    "sinopse": "Part 4 of the De Burgh series.\n\nStephen, the drunkest, most womanizing member of the de Burgh family, has everything he could ever ask for. But his father orders him to leave during a blizzard to escort Mistress Brighid to see her inheritance. The job is annoying enough, but to make it worse, the lady in question hides her hair in a wimple and wears a perpetual scowl. The two can't possibly understand each other, and yet a passion akin to destiny constantly burns between them.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
