## Sinopse

A story of cultural exchange between an American with Japanese origin and a Saudi Arabian roommate. The manga shows the differences in Islamic and Japanese cultures while comparing and showing that no matter how different or similar it can get, deep down humans are humans and we really aren't that different even if we can get along or not.
