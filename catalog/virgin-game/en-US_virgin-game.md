## Sinopse

When it comes to flirting with girls, shy Kenji never knows how to make the first move! Too bad his anxiety keeps him from seeing the sly glances and sweet smiles of his lifelong friend and neighbor Kaori. Will the cutie right under his nose finally end Kenji’s devastating dry spell?

Virgin Games goes for the gold with stories of sexy surrender and sneaky surprise! Will a devoted nurse show her boyfriend her best bedside manner? And can a well-done homework assignment win one young man the extra credit he’s always craved?
