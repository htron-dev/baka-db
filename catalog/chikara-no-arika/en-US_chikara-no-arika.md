## Sinopse

There are people in the world who are lonely and hurting, but are in possession of great power. However, they may never know, because without the presence of others of their kind, their powers do not exist.

One of these people is Tsutomu, a smart kid whose parents drove him to study for school at the exclusion of everything else in life. One day he snapped, drove his parents out of the house in a fit of rage, and became a recluse. That could have been the end of things for Tsutomu, but meddling by a mysterious clairvoyant person called Satoru introduced Tsutomu to his own latent power. Now they will try to gather more of their kind, including a mute, neglected boy and a domestically abused girl, in an effort to create their own group of friends.
