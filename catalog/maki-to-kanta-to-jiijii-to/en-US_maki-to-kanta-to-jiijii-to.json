    "sinopse": "A puppet animation set in a mountain village in Japan.\n\nOutside a village in deep snow, there lived a boy named Kanta and his grandpa. One day, the grandpa gets sick and plenty of firewood they had at home is running out.\n\nWithout firewood, the grandpa may freeze to death. Kanta makes up his mind to go get some firewood by himself from the woodshed. In spite of his willingness, little boy Kanta fears the woodshed; it seems very spooky at midnight and far away. Kanta gathers all his courage and steps forward.\nIn the end, Kanta makes a very small and yet precious finding.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",
