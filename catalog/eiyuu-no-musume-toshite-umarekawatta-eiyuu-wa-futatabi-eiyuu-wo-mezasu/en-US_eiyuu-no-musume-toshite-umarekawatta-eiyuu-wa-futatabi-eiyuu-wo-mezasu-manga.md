## Sinopse

Reid, one of the six great heroes of legend, lost his life during a fight with a demon. Floating around in the afterlife, he met a suspicious goddess who assured him that he would live once again. When Reid opened his eyes, he discovered that he was reborn as a baby. Moreover, as the daughter of his former fellow comrades.

While Reid initially struggled to become a hero in his former life due to his half-demon heritage, he realizes that he has been reborn as the daughter of the legendary hero and the powerful saint. With the experience he gained from his past life, as well as the talents inherited from her parents, Nicole aims to become a hero yet again.
