    "sinopse": "Woo and Wah are strange creatures with unknown genders. They are not siblings, nor a couple; their relationship can at most be approximated as \"friends.\" Woo and Wah both have strange protrusions on their heads: a tentacle that stretches and shrinks with emotion, and is capable of grabbing things.\n\nThe two live on the outskirts of town in the woods, preferring to keep away from the city. However, they do enjoy watching television.",
