    "sinopse": "At long last, the demon invasion is over. The hero Kyle Lenard has struck down the Demon Lord with the aid of his companions and brought peace to the land. Although the fighting is finished, the land is in ruin. Most of the heroes have fallen one by one, leaving a mortally wounded Kyle as the only survivor.\n\nWith his strength fading, Kyle accidentally activates a mysterious artifact within the slain Lord's lair and is sent back in time to a few years before the conflict. Suddenly gifted with a second chance, Kyle reunites with his friends Seran the swordsman and martial artist Riize. The group must once again rally together a fighting force and use Kyle's knowledge of the future to prepare the world for a war no one else knows is coming.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
