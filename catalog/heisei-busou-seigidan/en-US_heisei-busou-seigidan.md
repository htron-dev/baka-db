## Sinopse

Kamikaze Zero (looking suspiciously like Kakugo) armors himself to fight off an extremely immoral group of bullies.

All Yamaguchi Takayuki fans will love this. Like Cyber Momotarou, it's just one volume but has a continuous story instead of random standalones. I must put a warning on this one though. It's got nudity, violence, gore and a strange sort of sexuality going on throughout the entire thing. It's weird but from this guy, not something you'd be too surprised about.
