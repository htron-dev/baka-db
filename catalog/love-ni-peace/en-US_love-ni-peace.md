## Sinopse

College student Ayame's boyfriend is the handsome police detective Koichi. Two months after what seemed like a destined meeting, Ayame and Koichi are a couple who wants nothing but a lovey dovey relationship with plenty of hot sex to spice it up. However, having a police detective for a boyfriend naturally implies that constant troubles won't be far behind. Battling injustices out in society and sexual passions in bed, there is never a dull moment in their relationship! Though wanting a loving and peaceful relationship is understandable, can you really complain when it's hot and spicy?
