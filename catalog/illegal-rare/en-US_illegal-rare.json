An organization is being formed to protect these rares, and allow them to live their lives as they like. The starting members of this organization are few; there's the masked Fukumen, the Black Vampyr king AxL, and they are soon joined by the sweet-voiced mermaid Mirror. Together, they will protect the rares from the deadly hunters!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 4: Dark Pawn: Yami no Shichiya, Tsukumogami, Nurarihyon no Mago Gaiden",
