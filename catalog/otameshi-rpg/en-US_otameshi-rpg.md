## Sinopse

Without really understanding what was happening, Rhea was chosen to be one of the fifty "apprentice hero" of the kingdom. Despite the apparent mistake, she unwillingly accepts this new adventure, armed with her manual under her arm. Right after bidding good-bye to her best friend, she encounters 2 weirdos who will quickly become her comrades, as well as the mysterious Burn, another apprentice hero who seems really skillful.
