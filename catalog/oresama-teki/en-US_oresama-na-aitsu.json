    "sinopse": "Ryo is helping out as his father’s modeling agency. But, his classmate and rising rookie model at the agency, Ito, is openly antagonistic to Ryo’s older brother, a very charismatic model. Seems like Ryo has been paying too much attention to his brother’s career and not Ito’s budding popularity. Ito finally corners Ryo and demands that looks at him and him only! After a passionate kiss, he promises that crossing him will incur punishment! Ito may be an arrogant boy who does nothing but give order, but Ryo is undone by his forceful and dominating approach!\n\n(Source: MU)",
