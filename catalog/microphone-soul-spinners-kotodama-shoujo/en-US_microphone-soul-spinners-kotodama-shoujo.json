    "sinopse": "This is \"Holy Hierarchy Academy,\" the world's best girls' high school that trains future stars. Here, the top dog students have all the control, and they possess a unique beverage: the Hierar Milk, extracted from the mythical bovine, the Hierar Beef. One swig from these divine drops bestows enough radiance and go-getter energy that nothing but the position of top dog will satisfy.\n\nGetting it means winning in battle at the academy. This year will feature the highest form of competitive self-expression, the rap battle! This youth story is about four students at the bottom of the hierarchy who meet in a rap battle and climb to to the top!\n\n(Source: ANN)",
