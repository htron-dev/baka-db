## Sinopse

This is "Holy Hierarchy Academy," the world's best girls' high school that trains future stars. Here, the top dog students have all the control, and they possess a unique beverage: the Hierar Milk, extracted from the mythical bovine, the Hierar Beef. One swig from these divine drops bestows enough radiance and go-getter energy that nothing but the position of top dog will satisfy.

Getting it means winning in battle at the academy. This year will feature the highest form of competitive self-expression, the rap battle! This youth story is about four students at the bottom of the hierarchy who meet in a rap battle and climb to to the top!
