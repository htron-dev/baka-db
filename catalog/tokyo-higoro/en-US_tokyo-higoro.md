## Sinopse

A requiem for the anguished, lost, and wandering in life over 50.

With Japan entering a new era, the story centers on Shiosawa, a former manga editor for a major publisher. After going into early retirement, he now finds himself wondering about what the world of manga means to him - is it work, a form of expression, or friendship?
