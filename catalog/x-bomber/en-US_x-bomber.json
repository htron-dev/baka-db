An alien cruiser sweeps through Earth's defenses and issues an ultimatum - hand over the (F-01) or face destruction. Fortunately Star Fleet's last hope, the X-Bomber beats off the cruiser, but the question it asked remains: what is the F-01? When a mysterious space sailing ship appears near Pluto and is attacked by the alien cruiser, Star Fleet Command recognizes that there is more going on than they realize.\n\n(Source: Star Fleet wiki)",
