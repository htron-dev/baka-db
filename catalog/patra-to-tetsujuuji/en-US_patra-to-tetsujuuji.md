## Sinopse

In 30 B.C., Cleopatra fell into eternal darkness--or so it should have been. However, she was drawn from the underworld by the gods of Ancient Egypt, gaining eternal youth. She lurked underground in North Africa until she resurfaced in 1942, during World War II. Along with Lieutenant Antonio, whom she fatefully encountered, she heads for the base of the general of the German army. However...

After more than two thousand years, the curtain rises on the reconquest of Egypt!
