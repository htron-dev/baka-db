## Sinopse

The noise of the badly projected cathode ray tube image cleared up and a news program called "Ficfyon 7" appeared on the monitor. Professor Kim Wilson, an expert on the mysterious genre of "Ficfyon" was introduced as a guest, and the host asked him questions about the current state of "Ficfyon." The professor's answer was not in words, but a mysterious gesture. With the presenter's astonished expression, the images on the monitor split and repeat like a matryoshka. Eventually, the program ends as if nothing had happened, but the strange loop continues afterwards...
