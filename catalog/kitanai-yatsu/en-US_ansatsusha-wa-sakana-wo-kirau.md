## Sinopse

"When you want me to do work, please choose a sunny day".
"Pray. The only thing you can do is to pray".

Yakumo is a killer who hates fish and is afraid of water. He was bought from a Karachi Boss by the Isseikaiakeno Group. He only follows the leader's right hand man, Yoshitaka, and pesters him for a "reward" after every job. Both are drowning deeply in this mysterious relationship between a man and a boy - a hard-drawn gem of Roman picaresque
