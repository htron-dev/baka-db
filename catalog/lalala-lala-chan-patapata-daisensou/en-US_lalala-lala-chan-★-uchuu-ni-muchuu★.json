    "sinopse": "An alien named Luckle from the planet Lucky Star crashes their spaceship in Mori Town. He has the ability to give \"lucky\" or \"unlucky\" outcomes to people via telekinesis. Lala-chan helps him get to safety but in doing so, the town (and her friends) thinks she's harboring a dangerous being using it to do crimes no thanks to Salmiakki. Unfortunately a darker power lurks to bring wickedness upon Mori Town by corrupting Salmiakki even further.",
