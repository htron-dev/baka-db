## Sinopse

A collection of one-shots showing the love development of students from the eyes of the dorm dog. The dog's name is Kai and he himself loves a second year girl. Kai is frustrated with how humans don't say what is really on their minds and keep so many things hidden within their hearts. He says often if he could speak a word he would confess his love to the girl he admires. What happens when this girl loves another?
