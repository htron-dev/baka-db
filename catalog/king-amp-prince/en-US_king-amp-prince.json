I wonder which of us will come up on top in the “Big Two” battle on campus!?\n\n3 & 4 - Not Because I Want to Be Your Friend!\nYuma is an antisocial highschool student with only one friend, Ryoji. They've been bestfriends for 5 years but nobody understand why charismatic and friendly Ryoji keeps hanging out with him, not even Yuma himself. The only thing he knows is that he don't want to lose Ryoji but what is going to happen, when Ryoji says he doesn't want to be Yuma's friend?\n\n(Source: Fantasy Shrine)",
