    "sinopse": "Nearly 2000 years ago, the prosperous Han Dynasty of China collapsed. Heroes rose and fell, and three nations emerged—Wei, Shu, and Wu. Historians refer to this period as the Three Kingdoms period. The romance of the three kingdoms is an intriguing tale of heroic deeds, of alliance forged and broken, of loyalty and betrayal.\n\n(Source: MU)",
