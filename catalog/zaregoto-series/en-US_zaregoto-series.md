## Sinopse

The story revolves around an unnamed protagonist and the murders and mysteries he encounters. He tries in vain to stay out of the story, but instead, he always gets dragged into the center of everything. Even though it seems that he contributes a lot, he always finds out that whatever he did was meaningless in the end.
