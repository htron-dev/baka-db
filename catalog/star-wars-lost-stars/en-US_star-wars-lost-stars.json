    "sinopse": "The Empire can be seductive, particularly if you're an aspiring young pilot...\n\nThane Kyrell and Ciena Ree both know this very well when they enroll Imperial Academy, eager to pursue their dreams. When Thane discovers the darker side of the Empire, though, and defects to the Rebellion, the pair's lifelong friendship will be put to the ultimate test.\n\nWill Thane and Ciena's relationship—or even they themselves—survive this galactic conflict...?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
