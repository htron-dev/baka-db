    "sinopse": "Tomoko Kuroki is not cool. She is unattractive, socially awkward, and spends most of her evenings playing video games. Even so, no one wants popularity as desperately as she does. With one ingenious idea after another, Tomoko comes ever closer to achieving her goal—or so she thinks. Utilizing such innovative methods as imitating popular anime personas and buying expensive panties, she claws her way toward attaining the social status of her dreams.\n\nPathetically hilarious and strangely charming, Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! depicts Tomoko's daily struggles with social anxiety in a lighthearted and relatable way.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
