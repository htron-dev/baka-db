    "sinopse": "Elna was entrusted with ruling a country at a very young age when her father, the king of a small kingdom, fell very ill. With such a heavy burden placed upon a mere teenager, the king gave Elna an important piece of advice about how he made his time of rule a success: \"find your shadow.\" By finding her double, she will find the will to live and be brave even in the most dire situations. Elna does find a person who looks identical to her, but it turns out fate loves to play games. Teshio used to be a simple peasant who had a problem of always being mistaken for a girl but he is about to go from rags to riches because he becomes the new shadow for princess Elna.",
