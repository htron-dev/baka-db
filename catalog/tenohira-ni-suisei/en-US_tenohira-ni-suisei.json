The night before her very first day though, she ends up getting really drunk due to nerves and winds up having a one-night stand with a pretty attractive guy. However, it turns out that the guy is actually her manager at the company!! Even though she has no memories of their one-night stand, she's pretty sure that he was a nice guy, but now that she's working under him, he's just a big bully...!?\n\n(Source: Clairparfait)",
