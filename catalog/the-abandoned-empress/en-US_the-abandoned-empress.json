    "sinopse": "From the moment of her birth, Aristia La Monique was told she would become the empress. She trained every day, all so that one day, she would stand as an equal beside Crown Prince Ruvellis Kamaludin Shana Castina. But her efforts were in vain; hated by Ruvellis, she is cast aside in favor of the otherworldly girl Jieun.\n\nNow a mere queen in charge of governmental affairs, her happiness, pride, and family are stolen from her. In the end, she is executed by the very man who held her heart. However, what awaits her is not the afterlife, but the world of seven years ago. Armed with the knowledge of future events, the forsaken former queen sets out to change her fate and hopefully reclaim the life she never had.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
