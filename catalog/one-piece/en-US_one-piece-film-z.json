On their voyage, the pirates come across a terrifying, powerful man, former Marine Admiral Z.\n\nZ is accused of having stolen the \"Dyna Stones\", weapons believed to have the power to shake up the New World.

In fear of such a phenomenal event, marines start to take action against the former admiral.\n\nEven if it means stumbling upon marines and the navy, the Straw Hat Pirates decided to chase after Z and stop him from causing havoc.
