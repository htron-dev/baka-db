## Sinopse

On the morning before he meets the crew of the Straw Hat Pirates, young sous-chef Sanji enjoys a peaceful day at work onboard the floating restaurant Baratie. His momentary stasis is broken by the arrival of a food critic with gourmet tastes—a woman who is completely unimpressed with the food she's served by Baratie's staff.

With Baratie's head chef Zeff away on business, Sanji must deliver a meal capable of silencing the complaining critic before she can depart with a bad taste in her mouth.
