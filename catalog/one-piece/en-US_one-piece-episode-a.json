Ace, will follow in his infamous father's footsteps as the fearless captain of a pirate crew. The other, Masked Deuce, becomes the reluctant first member of Ace's Spade Pirates. Survival is not enough for these seafaring buccaneers, as together they seek treasure, excitement, and a route to the New World.\n\n(Source: Viz Media)",
