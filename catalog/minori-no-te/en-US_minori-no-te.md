## Sinopse

Chiropractor Minori Shigefuji runs a clinic known as the Oasis. Although a trained professional, Minori can provide an entirely different service for the right customer. He will do what he believes is best to attain his customers' satisfaction.

Among his "special" customers are the likes of Tatsuyuki Ooyamoto, the heir to a yakuza syndicate who has been causing some problems for Oasis regular Asoda, and even famous actor Yuu Umehara, who frequents the clinic.

Despite his success, no matter how many customers he satisfies, he will never forget his failures as a doctor nor the man from his past.
