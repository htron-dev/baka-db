## Sinopse

After his visits to a rather special chiropractor come to an end, the Ooyamato group's fourth head, Tatsuyuki, experiences the heartbreak of unrequited love. He spends his days neglecting his duties in favor of wallowing in his sorrow. In order to help him recover, his caretaker Asoda sends him to one of the group's branches in Fukuoka. There, he does his best to return to his old self—playing around in the city, visiting host clubs and prostitutes, and drinking profusely. One night, drunk out of his mind, he mistakes a stranger on the street for the object of his affections. Tatsuyuki wakes up the next morning hungover and in the bed of the stranger, a man who claims to know him.

Nozomi Koga is a preschool teacher and survivor of childhood abuse. Having fallen in love with Tatsuyuki when they were children, he has spent his life waiting to again meet the young yakuza boy that once comforted him—and now that he's here, Nozomi does not plan to let him go. But with the appearance of an untrustworthy loan shark, Uichi Rogi, and the issue of Tatsuyuki's lingering feelings for his "Minori-sensei," can Nozomi win over Tatsuyuki's heart?
