However, their life as \"newlyweds\" is rudely interrupted when they run into an old, high school classmate, Yuki. Otani has always been suspicious of the close friendship between Yuki and Tachibana; and honestly, his suspicions may not be that far off... Are the feelings between Yuki and Tachibana simply an ordinary crush, or could they be more?\n\n(Source: Juné)",
