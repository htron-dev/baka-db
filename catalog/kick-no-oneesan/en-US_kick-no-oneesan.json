Since then, he was smitten and went to all three of her matches, but then all of a sudden, she stopped competing and he became at a loss as to what to do. But then he runs into her by accident on the street on his way home from work and discovers that this woman, who wants to become the world champion, is far more complicated than he could have ever imagined…\n\n(Source: MU)",
