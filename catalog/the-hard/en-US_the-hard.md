## Sinopse

M60-toting Kenji Hado, known as "the Hard," pays his divorce bills by working in the US as a bounty hunter. Masseria, a ruthless and ambitious mafia boss, targets his family, starting with the Hard's father-in-law, a Don in the NY mafia. Hard's aim, while poor when sober, becomes extremely accurate when drunk!
