    "sinopse": "When Katou used the persuasion of tears, the senpai he had always admired agreed to go out with him. Katou swore that he wouldn't lay a hand on Serizawa until he liked him back, so he kept their relationship platonic. Serizawa suddenly comes to stay over at his house, inviting him for a kiss, and testing Katou's control. Seeing Serizawa showing such an erotic expression, Katou just can’t hold back anymore!!!\n\n(Source: Enterbrain, translated)",
