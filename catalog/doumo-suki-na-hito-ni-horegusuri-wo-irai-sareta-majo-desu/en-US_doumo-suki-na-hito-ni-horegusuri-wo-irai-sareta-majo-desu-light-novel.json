Wanting to increase what little time she has with Royal Knight Harij, Rose sends him on a wild-goose chase for the ingredients but gets more than she bargained for when the grumbling knight starts visiting her every day... to feed her?\n\nThis is the heartwarming story of a shut-in witch and an arrogant, strait-laced knight whose romance starts from a love potion.\n\n(Source: Cross Infinite World)",
