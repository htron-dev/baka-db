## Sinopse

"I want you to make a love potion."

The Good Witch of the Lake's four-year crush ended in heartbreak with a single request from the object of her affections! Wanting to increase what little time she has with Royal Knight Harij, Rose sends him on a wild-goose chase for the ingredients but gets more than she bargained for when the grumbling knight starts visiting her every day... to feed her?

This is the heartwarming story of a shut-in witch and a straight-laced knight whose romance starts from a love potion.
