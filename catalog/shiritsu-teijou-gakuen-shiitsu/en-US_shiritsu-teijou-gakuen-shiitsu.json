There's even an Elite Four, who each excel at a different virtue: moral uprightness, along with physical, academic, and artistic ability. As the next in line in a family of politicians spanning generations, Haruta's partner Nachi is expected to also venture into the political world, and so to make this happen he breaks up with Haruta and enters Teijo Academy to follow in his father's footsteps.
