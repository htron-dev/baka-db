    "sinopse": "Marla and Jaicey are twin sisters. They were separated at birth and reunited 24 years later, but Jaicey asks Marla to keep it a secret. She doesn't want her loving adopted family to know about Marla yet. Jaicey's brother, Jake, regards his sister's new \"friend\" with suspicion and is mean to Marla, but she is just happy to have a family of her own, after years of loneliness. How could she have known that more suffering awaits her...?\n\n(Source: MU)",
