## Sinopse

What kind of future awaits the boy who holds two powers that can change the world?

A technological revolution was brought about by The Last Witch, to the world of magic, with the introduction of 'science'. Lyle, a boy wielding the powers of both magic and science, was caught between his childhood friend, the noblewoman Maria who was pressing forward into an era of science, and Lunaria, a girl of the Phantasm race, a symbol of the age of magic.

Two different girls, from two different eras and ages. Which will the boy bearing the power to change the world choose?
