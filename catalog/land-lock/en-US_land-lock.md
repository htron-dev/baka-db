## Sinopse

Ryo was an average high school student until a plane he was on crashed in a frozen wasteland. Now, there’s no telling if help will come, and the surviving passengers are already fighting among themselves. Nonetheless, Ryo struggles to find a way to work together and save everyone, but could there be a secret reason for these circumstances that he’s unaware of?
