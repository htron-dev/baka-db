## Sinopse

It's tough being a ghost in the modern era. A group known as "The Seven Wonders" are distressed by the lack of children taking tests of courage to the school that they haunt. Without children who believe in them and perpetuate ghost stories, they will eventually cease to exist! Can they figure out how to instill fear in children, or is the modern world already scary enough?
