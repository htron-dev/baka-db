## Sinopse

Natsuki cannot fall asleep unless he tires himself out through sex, so he picks partners with no strings attached to help him out. One rainy day, he comes across a handsome guy waiting in the rain at the entrance to his building and takes him home. With one condition, they begin to live together in Natsuki's apartment.
