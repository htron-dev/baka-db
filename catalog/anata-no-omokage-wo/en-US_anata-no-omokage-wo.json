    "sinopse": "Despite having become an independent and successful flower stylist, Diana is still scarred by her father's abuse from her childhood. Cameron was always the one protecting her back then. But her social standing was too far removed from the son of a prestigious family, so her love for him couldn't possibly work. Even after Cameron left town, Diana kept hold of the memory of him in her heart. But after ten years, he comes home! Why now? It is a bittersweet reunion. Diana is pregnant, and Cameron is terribly drunk...\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
