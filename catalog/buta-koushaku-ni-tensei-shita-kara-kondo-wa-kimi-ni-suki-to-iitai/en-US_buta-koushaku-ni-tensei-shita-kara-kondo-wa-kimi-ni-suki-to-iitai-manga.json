    "sinopse": "The popular anime \"Shuya Marionette\" features your standard protagonist and a harem of girls, but it is the show's villain Slow Dening who is the fan-favorite. Also known as the piggy duke, Slow was initially recognised as a magic prodigy and worthy heir to the Dening house, only to waste it all—but this disappointing personality was actually a front to lower himself in order to stand as an equal to his attendant Charlotte, and finally profess her love for her. But the piggy duke was not destined to have a happy ending in the anime, as Charlotte would eventually leave him to join the protagonist's harem.\n\nOne fan is therefore dismayed when he wakes up in the world of Shuya Marionette, in the body of the canonically detested Slow. However, he has no intention to let events unfold as they will. Using his knowledge of the anime's plot, he sets out to change his pig-like habits, improve his rock-bottom reputation in school, and do everything in his power to reach a happy ending with Charlotte. But this will be no easy task, as the anime's antagonistic forces have plans of their own.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
