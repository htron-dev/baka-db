## Sinopse

In the popular anime Shuya Marionette, there is a character whom everyone looks upon with scorn: the so-called "Piggy Duke," third son of Duke Denning and a student of Kirsch Mage Institute. This can only spell doom for the current Slowe Denning, who knows he's been reincarnated into the world of that anime as said villain!

There is a ray of hope, however. If he uses his in-depth knowledge of the anime and his unparalleled power as a master of all the elements, surely Slowe can gain popularity with his peers and change his fate! Perhaps this time, he can make the one small wish that never came to fruition in the anime come true: to become a man worthy of Charlotte, his retainer, and to confess his love to her!
