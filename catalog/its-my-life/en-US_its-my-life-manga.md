## Sinopse

A knight captain at long last after a grueling ten years service has left and with what he saved over the years bought a new home... a castle fit for a man seeking a peaceful life. To relax and enjoy life. Alas... that peace will continue to last, but hijinks will come with his house warming gift. A hobbit/midget elf/child arrives seeking an evil god and assume he is what she seeks. Who is the knight captain to dash a child dreams? More so after losing the chance to correct the misunderstanding.

And so this is where the adventure begins.
