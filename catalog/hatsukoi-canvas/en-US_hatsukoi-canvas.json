    "sinopse": "When Sakurako Kagawa was in elementary school, she drew a unique portrait of her classmate Ruri, which caused the other girl to run out of the class in tears. Subsequently, Ruri got into a car accident and her parents divorced, so a rumor began to spread that seeing Kagawa's pictures brings bad luck.\n\nNow a high school student, Kagawa only draws portraits of an imaginary friend to keep herself company. She panics when, one day, she forgets her sketchbook in the art room and a classmate reveals that he had viewed its contents. Akiharu \"Haru\" Hayama tries to offer assurance that her art is neither hideous nor cursed; through repeated attempts, he encourages Kagawa not to be embarrassed by the things she likes. Eventually, she realizes that Hayama is someone she likes—but just how much does she like him?\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
