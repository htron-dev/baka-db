## Sinopse

Ryouta plays it cool around all of his classmates, especially when it comes to girls. But he's always the one on the spot in a perverted situation. In some of these many random anecdotes about the lives of fifth graders you'll find: peeping at collarbones, eating chalk, accidental skirt flipping, missing bloomers, and many others...

Who says grade school can't have a high-school-type love story?
