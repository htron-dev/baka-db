## Sinopse

When two people adore each other, they're nothing less than devoted... even when they happen to be the same gender.

Each girl at the Tsubakigaoka Girls' Dorm is paired with a roommate. Tsumugi with Beniko, and Ai with Fuuko. Yet the girls each have their own crushes on each other, and it's making it impossible for them to stay "just friends.
