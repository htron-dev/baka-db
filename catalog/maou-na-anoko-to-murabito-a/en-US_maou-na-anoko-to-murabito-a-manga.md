## Sinopse

A lonely "demon lord" and a self-centered "hero"!?

What about "villager A," caught in the middle!?

This is a school that prepares people for roles in fantasy stories. However, those who possess the "traits" of a "warrior" or "wizard" are but a few. Most will become no more than mere "villagers." I, Satou, am also one of those "villagers"; but one day, a girl possessing the trait of "demon lord," Ryuugamine Ouko, set her eyes on me. She's short and a surprisingly calm, good girl, but she'll abruptly mutter about destroying mankind; give me a break. Taking up the opposition with passion is my childhood friend, Hikarigaoka Tsubasa; she's more trouble. This girl is also quite the beauty, but as soon as she makes up her mind, she's an absolute troublemaker...

This is a world that's slightly abnormal, with a slightly abnormal cast, interwoven in their dilemmas; a slapstick comedy!
