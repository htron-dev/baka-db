## Sinopse

1% of the population are witches. Most non-magical people look up to these witches and envy their power, but as witches already know, sometimes these abilities can be more of a curse than a blessing. When growing up already requires all the luck and effort a teenager can muster, what happens when you throw spirits, spell circles, and broomsticks into the mix?
