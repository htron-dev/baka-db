## Sinopse

Her past was a dark country

And Iantha Kethley was trapped at its borders, never quite able to escape the one defining moment of her life. Until the day she held Robert Armstrong at gunpoint—and he offered her a future she'd never dared imagine!

Rob Armstrong, Lord Duncan, swore he'd not be mere protector of Iantha Kethley, but true partner as well, for this sweetly vulnerable woman had a spine of surprising steel—a necessary attribute to face the danger that stalked her still. Her need drew him to her; her courage held him by her side—where he'd willingly remain, bound by honor, passion... and love!
