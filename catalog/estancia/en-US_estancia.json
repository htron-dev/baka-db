    "sinopse": "Fight to Live, Fight to Survive. If you want to live, reach Estancia. Your life is in your hands.\n\nSakia is a city of criminals - criminals who have been stripped of the memories of their past. Here, they rot yearning for the one thing they remember, their homes, their heaven, Estancia.\n\nThere is only one rule in Sakia. No one leaves without permission! The irony though, there is an escape, a train that leaves the city regularly. Is it too good to be true? Or is someone helping them, and why is Estancia the only thing they can remember?\n\n(Source: Tapastic)",
