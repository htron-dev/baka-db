After all, this whole world is my 'push'!\" However... it seems that Olivia gets a nosebleed that just doesn't stop every time she sees the target of the game! \"Yeah, let's just break the engagement with my fiancé, Aquasteed.\" I will one day enjoy this sacred place with the butler Levi, a non-game character who has great respect (?) for me!\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
