## Sinopse

My favorite capture target is so precious that my nosebleed doesn't stop! Olivia reincarnated as a villainess of the maiden game "The Villain Daughter." "I don't care about that!!! After all, this whole world is my 'push'!" However... it seems that Olivia gets a nosebleed that just doesn't stop every time she sees the target of the game! "Yeah, let's just break the engagement with my fiancé, Aquasteed." I will one day enjoy this sacred place with the butler Levi, a non-game character who has great respect (?) for me!
