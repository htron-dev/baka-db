    "sinopse": "Hardcore game addict and loner Souma Sagara spends all of his time playing the virtual reality game \"New Communicate Online,\" also known as \"Neko-Mimi-Neko.\" After Souma fails to keep his promise with his little cousin Maki to clean out the storage room of her house, Maki comes across a magical wishing mallet in the storage and accidentally wishes him away out of frustration.\n\nSouma's body is promptly teleported into New Communicate Online as a level one character, stuck in an unforgiving game world notorious for its glitches, developer shenanigans, traps, and unfair scenarios. However, having wasted years of his life away on this horrible game, he is well aware of its lazily coded mechanics and sets out to abuse their inner workings to his heart's content.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
