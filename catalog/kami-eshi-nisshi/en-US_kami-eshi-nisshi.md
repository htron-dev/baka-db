## Sinopse

Kotoe is a really quiet 18-year-old girl who loves drawing but just can't make friends. After her good-for-nothing NEET otaku brother convinces her of uploading amateur illustrations of anime characters, she actually begins to gain popularity online.

Watch how Kotoe's brother tries to make big money with Kotoe's illustrations so that he can get out of the countryside, go to Tokyo, and marry a seiyuu while she reluctantly keeps drawing in hopes of finding new friends and making lots of people happy.
