## Sinopse

Once upon a time, there was an arrogant ex-prince called Donatian Charles. He decided that he wanted a son to inherit his magical powers, so he kidnapped Adrienne, a girl from the nearby village. Adrienne was, at first, confused by the sudden marriage proposal, but then she gradually fell in love with Donatian Charles. What will become of these two and their stormy engaged life together?
