## Sinopse

Keizo Takeo, a lawyer, has kept away from others and eaten alone since he lost his only relative, his sister, Maho. Maho's best friend, Yuki, invites Keizo to a meal. There, Keizo hears the story of his older sister, who he didn't know about. With that meal as a trigger, Keizo gradually became more interested in "eating."
