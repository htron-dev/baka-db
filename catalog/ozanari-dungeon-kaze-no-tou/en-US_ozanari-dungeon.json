    "sinopse": "This manga follows the adventures of a group of mercenaries: barbarian Moka (the main character), rogue Blueman, and mage Kirinman. Moka and her gang belong to a dark mercenary guild. Moka, being a barbarian, has great physical strength and, of course, she has no brain. Despite her very revealing suit, she is very innocent, pure and naive.\n\n(Source: JanimeS)",
