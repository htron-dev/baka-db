    "sinopse": "Follows the rather tempestuous relationship of two writers and touches on the lives of those they interact with. Both those that hate and/or envy them and those that love and/or like them.\nNot a modern story, it seems to be set at least several decades ago, before computers at least. Despite this, it doesn't have a dusty, out-of-date feel to it, more like a slow-tempo modern story.\n\nVol.1 Hitodenashi no Koi (1999)\n\nVol.2 Itooshii Hito (2000)\n\nVol.3 Omoware Bito (2001)\n\nVol.4 Hitori ni Shinai (2002)\n\nVol.5 Aisareru Hito (2004)\n\n-officially dropped by Game Over or Continue after finishing up v2-\n\n(Source: M-U)",
