## Sinopse

Follows the rather tempestuous relationship of two writers and touches on the lives of those they interact with. Both those that hate and/or envy them and those that love and/or like them.
Not a modern story, it seems to be set at least several decades ago, before computers at least. Despite this, it doesn't have a dusty, out-of-date feel to it, more like a slow-tempo modern story.
