## Sinopse

Ray started life on a farm intended for no other purpose than supplying body parts. When she was young, her eyes were harvested, but a mysterious person rescued her, giving her new eyes with powerful capabilities. She can see through objects and inside people, and she uses these powers for good and profit.
