    "sinopse": "Dr. Black Jack - unlicensed, unorthodox, thoroughly brilliant - he is a surgical genius capable of such impossible feats like operating blind, and even operating on himself.\n\nIn this beautiful remake of Tezuka’s best-loved series, Dr. Black Jack's ingenuity and skills are once again called upon and put to the test: a starlet who has built her life around a secret; a tortured artist who has lost his muse; a pro-fighter whose compassion is his handicap; and a disfigured man whose face has corrupted his soul.\nAs he takes on cases that will push the limits of medical science, only he can create the miracles necessary to save his patients.\n\n(Source: Chuang Yi).",
