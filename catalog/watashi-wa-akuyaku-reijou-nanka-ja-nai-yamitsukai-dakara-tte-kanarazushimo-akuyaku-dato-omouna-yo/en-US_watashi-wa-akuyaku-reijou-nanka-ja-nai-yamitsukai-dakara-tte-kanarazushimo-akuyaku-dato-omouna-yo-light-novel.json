    "sinopse": "Due to a certain incident, Sakura's life ended abruptly. To think her life amounted to this...\n\nThough depressed for a brief moment, she soon realized she'd reincarnated into the world of a novel she once read! Even so, the person she reincarnated as was none other than the villainess, Claudia.\n\nUnder the divine protection of the Dark Spirit King, she finds herself despised by those around her, and, in the end, she's fated to meet a tragic death?! No way in hell she’ll let both her last life and this one meet a Bad End! But even when she tries to take action to somehow change her fate...?\n\n(Source: Haruparty)",
