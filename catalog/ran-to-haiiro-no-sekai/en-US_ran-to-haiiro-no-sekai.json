    "sinopse": "Aspiring little sorceress Ran Uruma feels frustrated as she frantically searches for her favorite pair of shoes. Despite her being just an elementary school child, those particular shoes allow her to transform into the body of an adult. Ran teems with magical potential but has yet to learn how to control it. Knowing this, her beast sorcerer brother Jin hides the shoes until she completes cleaning their house.\n\nRan's mother Shizuka is one of the most powerful sorceresses to exist and must live far from home to look after the city. Head of their family and of all sorcerers, Zen is also often away attending business and has to leave Jin in charge of the household. Ran can be quite difficult to handle and only a single pair of eyes isn't enough to keep tabs on her every mischief. With the freedom she gets while no one's restricting her, Ran explores the magical abilities that drive her toward many fascinating adventures.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
