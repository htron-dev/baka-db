## Sinopse

After losing her father to illness and her abusive husband in a car accident, all Sophie has left is a company on the brink of bankruptcy and an old mansion. Javier Vasquez, a young Spanish businessman who has risen in the world by dint of mergers and takeovers, has offered his assistance out of pity. Sophie is puzzled by his generosity, which seems too good to be true. Seven years ago Javier and Sophie were in love, but Sophie honored her family's wishes to save their business by marrying someone else. At the time Javier was poor, but now he's rich... What will happen now that their positions are reversed?
