## Sinopse

Law student Masahiro Matsunaga has decided he's definitely going to bed the lithe-bodied and peerlessly beautiful Takane Takekawa. Masahiro pushes aside the men who surround him and tries to monopolize Takane's attentions, but Takane declares clearly, “I don't want to limit myself to just one person!” What will happen to Masahiro, who is using every trick he knows to make Takane say with love, “I love only you”? An erotic love battle erupts!
