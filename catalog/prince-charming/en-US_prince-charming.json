    "sinopse": "Yuzu and Yukimura have gone to the same schools since elementary school, but they're still far from what you could call \"friends\". One day, a new transfer student, Fujiwara, arrives at their school. With his prince-like looks and personality, Yuzu can't help but be attracted to him. Are her feelings for him love? If so, then why can't she seem to get Yukimura out of her mind?! (Source: Vampire Knights)",
