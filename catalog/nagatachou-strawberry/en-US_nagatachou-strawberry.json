    "sinopse": "Ichinose Hime is the daughter of the Prime Minister of Japan, and because of this, she has been unable to lead a normal school life. Hoping to hide her title and lead a normal high school life and get a boyfriend, she moves to a high school far from her old school. However, after going through all of this trouble to cover up her identity, a boy named Kirihara Natsuno finds out her secret. Unfortunately for her, he isn't so willing to keep the secret if she doesn't pay up. Will Hime get to live out a normal high school life as she had wished, or will it be a repeat of history?
