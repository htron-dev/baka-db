## Sinopse

The unlikely romance between an 18-year-old OL and her 32-year old coworker. They really love each other, but he has had bad luck with an age-gap relationship in the past. Though the age difference was only 7 years at the time, now there is a difference of 14-years! To make matters more complicated, their workplace does not allow employees to have romantic relationships with one another! Can they beat the odds that are stacked against them?
