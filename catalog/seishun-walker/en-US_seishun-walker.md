## Sinopse

From JShoujo Scans:

Being a tomboy who loves to get into fights, Ouka's had zero-luck in the love department. The motto she lives by leans more towards "Be Yourself" than "Be Ladylike," and she follows that to a T. But lately, her long time friend Mashima's been on her case about how she should act "more like a girl"...
