    "sinopse": "Issei Niwa lives night to night in the homes of random girls while he attends music college. Issei runs into a senior of the composer’s department, Mahiro Yui, as he makes a girl cry! Even though he is the son of a genius pianist, Yui is in the composition department. Issei, who fell in love with his music, involved Yui in his band for the cultural festival. Yui, who is usually awkward and unfriendly, has a pure, stoic side and Issei finds it absolutely endearing.\n\n(Source: Overlap, translated)",
