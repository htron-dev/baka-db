## Sinopse

Ayata is a Magic School student with no talent in Magic. Not only were his parents exceptional with Magic but he has to contend with the scary-faced Kurefu Sensei. Just what is he to do? Luckily for him help is at hand with the return of a certain odd-looking cat and the appearance of a certain person. But what is their connection?
