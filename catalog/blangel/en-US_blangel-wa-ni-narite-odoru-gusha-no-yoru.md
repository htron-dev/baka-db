## Sinopse

The last memory Alicia has from when she was still human was her mother dying to save her. Three years later in the year 2026, she roams the city of Tokyo as a new breed of species: half vampire, half human. She was one of the first humans to be experimented on with genetic alterations, leaving her with immortality and a hybrid blood able to rapidly heal injuries. Alicia hunts down supernatural beings with her partner Riola, hoping to find a clue to track down those who changed her and dare to use other humans as test subjects.
