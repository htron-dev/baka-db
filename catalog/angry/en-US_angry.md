## Sinopse

"In a Fight, they say that the first one to bleed from his or her nose is the loser. Father, Mother and Brother...They're all LOSERS that bled from the nose facing that damn monster called WORLD!

I'm not going to fall into that one. Even though I have to break my head, I'm not going to bow my head before anyone. I'm going to finish everyone! I'm going to throw everyone on the ground with the "Ushi Mata".
Even though my opponent is...a GIRL"

The Boy that doesn't bow his head to anyone...
