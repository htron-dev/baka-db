His mom arranges with his uncle Shirasaki to let him stay at his mansion with his two cousins Marie and Tomari, who he met many years before when he stayed with them for a short while. However, Keiichirou has forgotten nearly everything about back then, including why his cousins apparently now hate him.\n\n(Source: MU)",
