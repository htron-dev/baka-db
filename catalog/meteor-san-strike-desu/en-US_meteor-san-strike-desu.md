## Sinopse

Hero Hiro Kobayashi has been selected to protect the planet from the mysterious transfer student Yamada Meteor.
It's the start of an eventful day!

Until now Hiro Kobayashi has been nothing more than ordinary, and now he has to be the "hero who defends the earth"? Bombarded with aliens and the fate of the human race he feels lost. If he can't fix things, the humanity is doomed and the earth is going to fall prey to this "meteor monster"

Apparently "Love" can save them, but that's another problem altogether...
