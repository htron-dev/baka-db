## Sinopse

Yuuta Takenata has dreamed of being a gymnast ever since he was a little kid, so when he gets into high school he starts up the "Boys Rythmic Gymnatics" team. He works hard and gets enough members to compete, but then the club adviser forces them to take the delinquent Azuma Wataru into they're club. He's loud, whinny and has absolutely no interest in gymnastics. Yuuta just gives up on him, telling to stop coming to the practices. . But when he accidentally causes one of the members to break there arm, he has to start training so as to take they're part in the competition.
