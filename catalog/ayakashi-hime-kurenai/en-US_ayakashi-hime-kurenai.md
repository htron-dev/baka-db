## Sinopse

Yukio is a very cute and popular guy who meets the demon girl Kurenai. She appears out of nowhere, scolding him that he did not keep his promise that he would come the next day to play with her. That was in Yukio's childhood. Now, Kurenai is reminding him of his promise and moving in with him!!
