Moreover, it was Harold Stokes, the story's most hated character who was even given the title \"King of Trash\" by the players. Myriads of landmines were just waiting for him to step on them, like death flags! Will Harold be able to clear the survival route while avoiding the countless death flags in his way?!\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
