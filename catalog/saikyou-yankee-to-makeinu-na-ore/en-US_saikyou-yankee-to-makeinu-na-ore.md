## Sinopse

Akane Kiyonaga is a new yankee who is weak, but quick to start a fight. One day, when he is getting beat up by delinquents from another school, he is saved by Ryouji Kidou, the hero of his school, and the evil Tarou Kurokawa. After that, he just wants to be with his beloved Ryouji, but Kurokawa always messes with him. And eventually, it escalates into lewd conduct?!
