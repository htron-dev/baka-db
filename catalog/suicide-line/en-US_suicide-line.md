## Sinopse

Kuroda is a police investigator with a special talent for sniffing out corpses—literally—due to a traumatic event in his childhood where he was trapped in a room with his deceased family members for several days. After being assigned to the Missing Persons Division where they hope to make the best use of his ability, he meets a genius detective with an unbelievably high case closure rate.
