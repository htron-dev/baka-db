    "sinopse": "A victory for the national team was decided in the European Football Championship that night. The whole country overflowed with joy, including Leon who drank, raised hell, and ended up spending a night together with \"someone he should never have gotten involved with.\" That man's name was Al, from the rival team Liberta's ULTRAS supporters club! He understands that it will never work, but from their first meeting, Al is lodged firmly in his heart. In addition to the hooligan edition of a Romeo and Juliet-style love story, there is also a swindler, a film director, a peeping tom, and others.\n\n(Source: Moon in a Box)",
