    "sinopse": "Reporter Sarah is in a real bind after losing one of the red heels she secretly borrowed from work to write an article about. But as she's bemoaning her fate, a shocking figure appears—Caleb, the young CEO of a popular design company. He hints that he might have picked up the heel and demands Sarah write an article about his company. Confused by his conditions, she grudgingly accepts the trade, all the while trying her best not to fall for him.\n\n(Source: Harlequin/SB Creative Corp.)",
