    "sinopse": "Our protagonist, Inoue Konoha is still being led around by his senpai, the Literature Club's President, self-acclaimed \"Literature Girl\" who loves stories so much that she can eat them, Amano Touko.\n\nOne day, someone put in the Literature Club's \"Love Consultation Post Box\" a bunch of paper scraps that have the words like \"Hate\", \"Ghost is\" and a bunch of puzzling numbers on them. Calling the act as \"picking a fight with the Literature Club\", Touko once again got Konoha involved in her investigation; but when they found the culprit, this girl turned toward them, smile, then said \"I'm already dead.\"\n\n(Source: MU)",
