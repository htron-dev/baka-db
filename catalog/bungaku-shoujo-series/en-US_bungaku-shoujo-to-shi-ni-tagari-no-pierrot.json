    "sinopse": "The \"mysterious school comedy\" centers on the unusual members of a high-school literary club. Touko Amano, a high-school senior who calls herself the \"literary girl\" as the club president, is actually a supernatural creature (youkai) that devours stories — she tears pages from books to munch on them. Her club subordinate is Konoha Inoue, a second-year high-school boy who writes stories every day for Amano to eat. He once wrote an award-winning novel, but he wrote it under the penname Miu Inoue so readers thought the author was a mysterious 14-year-old bishoujo novelist. The stress from the novel's fame and its movie and television drama plans turned Inoue into an introverted recluse.\n\n(Source: MU)",
