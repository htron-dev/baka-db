## Sinopse

Michiharu is the only failing student in a highly educated family. His father tells his failing son to go visit a relative’s house to get lessons. When Michiharu visits his relative’s house during summer break, his cousin Natsuki, who is rumored throughout the city for being “extremely gay” is standing there, waiting for him! Natsuki insists that not only will he teach him how to study, he will also teach him how to play in the night…!?
