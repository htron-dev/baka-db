## Sinopse

Dimitri Lewandowski is a celebrated tenor in early 1900s Vienna. When he is killed in an accident, his corpse is colonized by the seeds of a vampire master. At first, Dimitri denies that anything has changed, but as the people around him start dying, he is forced to accept the ghastly truth.

Flash forward to 2008. In Tokyo, Azusa Kikukawa's troubled love life comes to an end with a fatal accident. Dimitri appears in her dying dreams with a diabolic proposal—he will save her lover if she agrees to become the breeding ground for the next generation of vampire seeds…
