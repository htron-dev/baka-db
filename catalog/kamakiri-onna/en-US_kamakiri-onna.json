    "sinopse": "Senno Knife attacks the Japanese urban legends in this horror compilation. In the title story, \"Mantis Woman\", Chiaki wonders why headless bodies are showing up around the school. She really shouldn't have gone to investigate alone. Be careful what you wish for when the one fulfilling the wishes comes from \"Hell's Gumball Machine\". A total of six short stories are in this novel.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
