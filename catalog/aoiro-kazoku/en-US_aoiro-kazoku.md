## Sinopse

The volume consists of three short stories. The first follows Sorakawa Aoi, a petite 16-year old girl who carries around a baseball bat and tries to live her life despite the fact that everyone around her, including her own family (rather, especially her own family) is a bit wacky. This may be an understatement.

The other two short stories follow a similar "everyone else in the universe is a boke" script.
