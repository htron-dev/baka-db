## Sinopse

Miyako and her younger sister are expecting their father from his business trip home at any minute, and wonder what sort of gift from his travels he has brought for them. What they get is something they never could have expected!

For Miyako’s younger sister Akane, their papa has brought a really nice necklace made of shells or stones. But Miyako not only gets a necklace, she gets a… boy. Yes! Miyako’s papa has returned from his travels with a boy for her! He is tall and handsome, with tanned skin and long blond hair. He says his name is Kyatto (or ‘Cat’) and he is the prince of the island that her father just got back from. He is about to turn 15 years old, and now he belongs to Miyako! He even claims she is his wife! They are fated to be together, it is destiny! (Source: shoujo-manga.com)
