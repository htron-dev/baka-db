But the \"twin pearls of Parros,\" the princess Rinda and the prince Remus, escape using a strange device hidden in the palace. Lost in Roodwood, they are rescued from Mongaul soldiers by a strange leopard-headed man, who has no memories except for the words \"Aurra\" and \"Guin,\" which he believes to be his name.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
