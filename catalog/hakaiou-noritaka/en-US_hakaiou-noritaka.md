## Sinopse

Noritaka is a loser in high-school with no hopes of ever being cool. He just happens to have a strong kick, a love for kickboxing, and a crush on a girl that's probably impossible to get. But wait, she's into to strong men, the total opposite of Noritaka. Maybe he can use that leg of his to get really strong at kickboxing and win her heart! Sounds like a plan? Read this manga to see if it works.
