Cursed by the goddess Kanou to remain in Kanou City until he fulfills a hundred people's wishes, Akiba's dream to control the world is in jeopardy. Then one day, Akiba and his council receive a strange task -- to find the god hidden in their school within one month, or perish together with the rest of the world. Will they find the god in time? Or will they be wiped out, along with Akiba's grand ambitions? Now let the game begin...\n\n(Source: Storm in Heaven)",
