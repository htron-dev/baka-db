## Sinopse

Stopping by his favorite bar in Tokyo's gay district, Yanagi picks up an attractive man, and the two spend a passionate night together. The next morning, however, the stranger proclaims that what they did makes him sick and then bolts from the room. With the weight of confusion and frustration crushing him, Yanagi thinks he'll never see the man again... until he finds out it's his good friend's twin brother, Arata. Even when confronted, Arata refuses to accept what happened that drunken night, so an angry Yanagi comes up with a plan to make Arata his sex slave as punishment...

And so begins the first of five volumes filled with drama, angst, suspense, passion, sex, and love.

Follow these two lovers in their struggle against all obstacles to find love and happiness together.

[Yaoi Generation]
