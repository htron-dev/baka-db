    "sinopse": "Tomitsu High School freshman Mononobe Fumika was looking for an extracurricular activity to join since it is an academic requirement. She randomly finds a very curious sounding club named the Ranobe, short for light novel. It's a small club headed by Asaba Misaki with 2 other members, Takeda Ryunosuke and Fujikura Koyomi. Fumika was never a big reader but these easy to read light novels really bring her into the world of story telling.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
