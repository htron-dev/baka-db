## Sinopse

Yuu: nice face, tall, big, dog-like and popular with the female classmates. And me, who who doesn't mind that he's attached to me, and actually feel a sense of superiority. More-than-friends for whom time and place don't matter? It's pleasant showing affection, and when we realize it, our hearts beat faster, but isn't such a relationship between men strange? And despite that...?
