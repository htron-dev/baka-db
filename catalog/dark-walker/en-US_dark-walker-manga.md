## Sinopse

Natsumi Orihara has been having trouble sleeping lately, as strange things have been invading her dreams. On a day that is unlike any other, a new student arrives in Natsumi's class and proclaims to Natsumi that she has overflowing energy... and then Natsumi has what seems to be a waking dream that feels all too real and unbelievable! Just what exactly is going on? What does the new student, Tenkawa, know about these dreams? (Source: Boku-Tachi)
