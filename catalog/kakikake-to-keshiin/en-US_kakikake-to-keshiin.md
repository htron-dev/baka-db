## Sinopse

This story is about the life of two very strange housemates; a cheeky kid named Ino and an anti-social grown-up called Roku. Ino, who was passed around from one relative to another, grew up in a city but one day he had to live in a rural area in an old and isolated house with a young man named Roku due to some problems with the relative.
