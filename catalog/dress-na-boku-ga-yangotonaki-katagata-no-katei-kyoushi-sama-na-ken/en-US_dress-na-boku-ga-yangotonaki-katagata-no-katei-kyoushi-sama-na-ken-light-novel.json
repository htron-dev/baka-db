His genius sister, Glinda, went missing two days before she's supposed to be sent to Ehren to be an royal tutor for the King's children. The sudden life change is too overwhelming for Sherlock, but he sees no way out. Later, he finds out the disturbing truth about the kingdom's intention with his sister.\n\n(Source: MU)",
