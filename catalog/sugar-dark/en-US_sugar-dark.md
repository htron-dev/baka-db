## Sinopse

What is love? Akio's love towards Haru is painful and it hurts, but he can't leave him. Haru and Akio's relationship is difficult to describe. Neither friends nor lovers, they only warm up to each other and take in each other's loneliness. As their relationship continues to grow more tainted, Haru meets Natsuhiko, a nice man who is completely opposite of Akio. Haru, having never felt kindness before, is attracted to him, but...

A story of love between three men.
