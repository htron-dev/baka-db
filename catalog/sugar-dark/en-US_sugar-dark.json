Neither friends nor lovers, they only warm up to each other and take in each other's loneliness. As their relationship continues to grow more tainted, Haru meets Natsuhiko, a nice man who is completely opposite of Akio. Haru, having never felt kindness before, is attracted to him, but...\n\nA story of love between three men.\n\n(Source: Cocobees)\n\nIncluded one-shots: Otoko wa Getsuyoubi ni Gomi wo Dasu, Aisubeki Bakadomo no Heiwa na Nichijou Seikatsu",
