With swords already drenched in blood, the two of them had been lured to a future they couldn't go back from...\n\nCelestial world and netherworld were separated by the land of chaos, Arcana. In that land, the red-haired Sieg Wahrheit, was chasing after one man - Delacroix. They carried the same dream once, two friends who fought together. However, presently they were enemies who tried to bring down each other. What had happened between the two of them? And what the conclusion will be?\n\nPainful conflicts between everyone had just begun in earnest! The lasting bond was at risk, great forces of battle fantasy!! Come forth, Legion!!!",
