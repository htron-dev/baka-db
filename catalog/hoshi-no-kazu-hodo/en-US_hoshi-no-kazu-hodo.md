## Sinopse

Brand-new student Shinichi wants to give up sports for a whole new scene! But what will he do when a cool stranger asks him to join his crazy club? Does Shinichi have the stamina to take on that many wild guys at once? Can an artist learn to cope with his demons without isolating those who love him most? And will a weekend getaway bring a band of not-quite brothers even closer together?
