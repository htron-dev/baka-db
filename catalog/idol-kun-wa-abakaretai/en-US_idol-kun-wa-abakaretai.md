## Sinopse

"Can you take some pics? I want you to shoot me... getting absolutely torn apart by you!" Yukinari's been chasing after scoops as a paparazzo for about a year. His next target is the super-popular Subaru Nagare, a pop star with a totally clean record. Discovering the two are old high-school classmates, Yukinari successfully gets invited into Subaru's home without giving up his true intentions... "I wanna see the side of you that no one knows." Out of nowhere, the clean-cut and princely Subaru desires more than just a renewed friendship! Yukinari's stunned when the "White Prince" reveals his true self, and a few glasses of wine, later, he's lost all control. Overcome by his carnal urges, he goes to town on the pop star's body... and becomes directly involved in his prey's first scandal!
