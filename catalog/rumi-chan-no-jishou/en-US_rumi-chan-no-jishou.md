## Sinopse

The manga follows Rumi Ikuno, a second-year student who transferred into Hanagaoka Private Girls' Academy. She leads a simple, oblivious life, even as she causes bewilderment and trouble around her. The manga depicts the profoundly strange girl's life that is sometimes amusing, but mostly irritating.
