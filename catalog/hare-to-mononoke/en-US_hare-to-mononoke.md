## Sinopse

"You're impure." Toki, a man who claims to be an immortal mononoke, and Yashio, a high school student who is suddenly told that he is impure. In the name of purification, a strange living arrangement between the two begins. Although Toki is nothing but teasing words and actions, Yashio can taste the loneliness he occasionally exhibits. As they spend time together, Yashio feels more and more drawn to him. However, knowing that Toki already has a loved one.
