## Sinopse

collection of 6 oneshots.

1. Escape. Akio is a juvenile delinquent who just got suspended from school for beating up the PE teacher, Koizumi is a model student. One day Akio runs into Koizumi at a convenience store and before you know it, they're driving around in a stolen car. How come Akio even knows Koizumi's name? And why is he stopping the car in this out-of-the-way place?

2. Soulful Cherry Bomb. For the last year and a half, Shuuji has been dating Kawano, but since Kawano got married a while ago, he's been coming by less and less, and when he does show up, they only have quick sex. Still, Shuuji is not so hard up that he would pay any attention to the crazy high schooler he met at the laundromat, no matter how much that kid says he likes him and wants to go out. Not even when the kid goes to ridiculous lengths to convince him of his sincerity. Or?

3. No Place to Go Home to. Odagiri Motoharu is a novelist who's taking a break from everything by renting an apartment in his old hometown, away from all his obligations in Tokyo. He wonders whether anyone will really miss him, whether anyone actually cares about his, rather than what he can do for them. Hirotomo lives next door, with Katsurou, and while the latter's girlfriend is there, Hirotomo is waiting outside, in the snow. Odagiri feels sorry for him, and takes him out to eat. When they return, Hirotomo shows his gratitude in a rather forward way, and that sets off a strange affair.
