## Sinopse

Tanaka Hajime and Harada were leaders of the yakuza group called Yanase. The two were "wiped out" in the conflict between their Yanase group and the Kawa-guchi group--or so the Kawa-guchi thought. The Kawaguchi group believed that they killed Hajime and buried him alive, but in reality Hajime was saved by Harada, and ended up suffering from complete memory loss from all the damage. Knowing nothing, Hajime asks him if their lives as Yakuza leaders is a lie, while Harada replies why would he. But when Harada tells Hajime that they were lovers, is that also true?
