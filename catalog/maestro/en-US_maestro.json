He, along with others, answer an ad for a new orchestra only to find an abandoned warehouse and a crazy old man constructing the rehearsal space. And no conductor. Kousaka takes over as first violin when the old man interrupts and criticizes him.\n\nTurns out that the old man IS the conductor and musical director, and he’s put together this orchestra with lofty goals in mind, and has told them he’s going to shape them up in only a month…\n\n(Source: MU)",
