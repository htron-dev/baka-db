## Sinopse

When I open my eyes, I find myself in an unfamiliar car, in an unfamiliar town, in front of the on-ramp to an unfamiliar highway. Before I can process any of this, I see the fiery explosions of multiple car crashes in the distance, and without thinking, I stomp on the accelerator and race toward the scene. I soon find that I’ve driven straight into hell at full speed with no brakes, just like everyone around me...! In the midst of this insanity, I discover the corpse of a girl, and suddenly I know—I am the brilliant detective. And I must solve the mystery of her death.

(Souce: Yen Press)
