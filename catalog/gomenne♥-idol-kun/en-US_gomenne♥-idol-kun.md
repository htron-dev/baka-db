## Sinopse

Genki has finally made his debut in an idol group, "Sexy Dangerous," attributing to their characters, but really, he's as clumsy as a 15-year-old can get. One day, he walks in on the member he has a secret crush on having xxx with his rival in the music room! Idol-senpai, Suzuhara, notices his broken heart and Genki's emotions start to sway, but it seems that he's only being treated like a child?!

The dramatic youth of these idols to which the rule of love is forbidden to chase after their dreams!
