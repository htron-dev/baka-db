## Sinopse

One day, Mitsuki Kosaka was abruptly sent on a trip to a different world. She was an otaku so she adapted really fast. Then she decided to live her life as a magician.

She made a living by making full use of the benefits of being able to automatically translate knowledge and language of her original world. But reality was harsh.

She was keenly aware that she was handling beautiful guys from this different world who could easily conquer maidens' hearts and dreams.

"I will absolutely not raise the love flag, never...!!"

The protected genius of the country who was strangely beautiful was worth greater than her fierce negative elements and was also called the supreme in this country.

This is the story of a girl who was sent to another world without any roles. The story of the woman who fully used her knowledge of the past to remove the obstacles from her life.
