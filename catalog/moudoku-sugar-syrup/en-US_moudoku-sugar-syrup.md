## Sinopse

Mizuki is a modern-day vampire who lives with some debauched eating habits, controlling his bloodlust with a bodily fluid that's a little whiter than blood. He always finds his meals outside his personal social circle, but when he loses control of his bloodlust, he accidentally assaults Sakura, a younger student from his college...! Mizuki's reason and instinct waver as he suddenly discovers a "delicious delicacy."
