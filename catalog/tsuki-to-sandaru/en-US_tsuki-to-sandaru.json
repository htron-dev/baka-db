The piercing eyes belong to a tall, intimidating student—Koichi Kobayashi. What exactly should Ida do about it? Is it discontent that fuels Kobayashi's sultry gaze... or could it be something else? With the schoolyard as a backdrop, Fumi Yoshinaga, creator of Antique Bakery, Flower of Life and Solfege, presents Moon and Sandals: a feel-good boy's love story and a long awaited manga series!\n\n(Source: justmanga.com)",
