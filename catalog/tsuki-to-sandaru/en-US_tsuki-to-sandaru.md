## Sinopse

As a newly appointed high school teacher, Ida has yet to gain confidence in his abilities. His insecurity grows worse when he feels someone intensely staring at him during class. The piercing eyes belong to a tall, intimidating student—Koichi Kobayashi. What exactly should Ida do about it? Is it discontent that fuels Kobayashi's sultry gaze... or could it be something else? With the schoolyard as a backdrop, Fumi Yoshinaga, creator of Antique Bakery, Flower of Life and Solfege, presents Moon and Sandals: a feel-good boy's love story and a long awaited manga series!
