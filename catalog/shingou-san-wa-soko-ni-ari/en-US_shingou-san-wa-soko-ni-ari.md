## Sinopse

Living in an electric appliance store at the corner of the shopping district, Kouichi Ainaga realized that a weirdly dressed, mysterious girl was standing at the nearby pedestrian crossing. Apparently, she was working for traffic control 24/7 without a break, taking care of the pedestrians so they can safely cross... However, when Ainaga goes to call out to her with fellow shopping district resident Namina, she refers to herself as a "robot"...?!
