## Sinopse

Kurihara Yuki has finally been granted her wish of dating her crush Momotsuki Shinya, a.k.a. Momo. At first glance, she just looks like a normal but very cute girl. However, she is in fact a maniac over Momo, taking notes of his activities and never missing the chance to see him in a cute moment. Momo, on the other hand, is inexperienced in love, and just wants to make Yuki happy.
