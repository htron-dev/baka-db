## Sinopse

"Love's Song"--This is collection of stories about three girls who projected their feelings onto a particular beautiful poem. Graffiti on a bench, memories of childhood times, thoughts that don't get communicated in a classroom all set the scenes for a lovely collaboration between poet Hamura Hiroshi and shoujo manga's great Akira Shouko! Many poems about love will move you deeply in this poignant collection of stories.
