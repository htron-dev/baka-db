## Sinopse

Alternative reality of Manchukuo filled with military disputes and dangerous mystical beings, where humans and monsters fight each other. In the year 1932 a little boy survives a horrible train crash. Seven years later in Harbin city, he meets a beautiful and mysterious gypsy girl from an ancient Clan of Shinnou. This destined meeting is only the beginning of a larger story that like a spider's web gets everyone caught in the chaos of the upcoming war.
