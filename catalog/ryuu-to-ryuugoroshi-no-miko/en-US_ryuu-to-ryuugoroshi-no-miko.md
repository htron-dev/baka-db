## Sinopse

A certain human country has become prosperous in exchange for sacrificing a maiden to a dragon. But with their progressing civilization, humanity then found the power to defend their country without having to rely to the dragon anymore.

Feeling that the dragon has already became a relic of the past, they choose a priestess to kill the dragon...

However, the dragon fell in love with the priestess at the first sight instead!
