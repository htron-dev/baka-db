## Sinopse

It was a normal Saturday morning, or so he thought. Going outside to get some sunlight, he found a girl covered in blood on his front yard. She introduces herself as a maid from hell, sent to the Earth realm to serve for Kazuma. Kazuma will now have to live with the maid from hell, Luko, and continue a comedic and slightly grotesque life with his new maid.
