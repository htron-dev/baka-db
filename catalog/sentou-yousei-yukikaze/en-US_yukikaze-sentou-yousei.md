## Sinopse

A coda to the OVA and novel of the same name, this six-chapter manga gives us a deeper glimpse into the back-stories of Rei Fukai, James Bukhar, Tomahawk John, and other members of the F.A.F.

However, some of the details about the characters' pasts and relationships appear to deviate from the sequence of events as seen in the anime. Therefore, this manga should only be read after having first watched the anime or read the novel, and treated as an alternate story of sorts.
