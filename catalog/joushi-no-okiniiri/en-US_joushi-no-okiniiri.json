    "sinopse": "Sakurai is a new hire who is having a secret relationship with his boss, Chief Akimoto. Even though the chief is gentle, suave, and unexpectedly, a pro when it comes to the H-department, he’s still an “old man” in Sakurai’s eyes! However, Akimoto sees right through the rather naive Sakurai and spoils him to the point that keeps him demanding for more… until they both come to regret it!",
