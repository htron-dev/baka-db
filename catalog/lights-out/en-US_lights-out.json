    "sinopse": "All Gun wanted to do was turn over a new leaf. A problem child since birth, Gun thought transferring to Northern Art High School and moving into the Lucky Residence would offer him a fresh start--a chance to begin again, away from his punch-drunk past.\n\nHe really should have known better. Whether it's having his attempts at romance with the lovely Seung-Ah thwarted time and time again by the lusty Ji-Ae, putting up with deliveryman Sung-Rae's dreams of heavy metal stardom, or dealing with Northern Art's gangs, Gun is going to have a very hard time shaking off his past. However, it's something he must do if he's to look towards the future, and Gun's future is a bright one indeed.\n\nFor on the hard asphalt surface of a bike track, Gun will finally lose his apathy and find himself. On the back of a motorcycle, Gun's life finally has purpose, and it's a purpose that will not be fulfilled, at least in Gun's eyes, until he's taken the checkered flag in the Korean Grand Prix.\n\n(Source: MU)",
