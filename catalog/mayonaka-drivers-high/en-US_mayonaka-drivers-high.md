## Sinopse

Conscientious cab driver Taira Tsunayoshi's days have been boring. That is, until one day, when a man gets into his cab soaked with blood and rain and tells him to go to Biei? a town in the northern island of Hokkaido. Though he's taken aback by the bizarre man, Taira sets out on their drive and stops to spend the night at a hotel, where the man suddenly suggests a hookup. This is a story of love and suspense between a serious cab driver and a handsome but mysterious man.
