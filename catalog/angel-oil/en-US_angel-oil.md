## Sinopse

In a future where cyborgs are more common than fully flesh and blood humans, a girl goes out to seek oil when her family's ration gets cut off. She needs to get it quickly so her grandmother's heart doesn't burn out, but no one has ever gone up above to the ration center and returned alive...
