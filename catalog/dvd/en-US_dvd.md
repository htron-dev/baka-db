## Sinopse

A chance encounter in a lingerie department. A cell number on a bra tag. Sometimes, you never know what can happen if you make that call.

For Ddam, it leads her to a night club dive where DD is the punk rocker DJ and Venu is the decoration. But there's more to them than meets the eye: DD occasionally waxes poetic, and Venu downplays his good looks by focusing on the importance of big breasts.

Since Ddam has her own odd behavior to deal with, being with these two unrepentant, semi-uncouth, not-bad-bad boys, could be what she needs to help her get out of her funk and maybe figure out what life's about.
