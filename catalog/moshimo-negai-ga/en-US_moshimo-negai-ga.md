## Sinopse

If you could have anything, what would you wish for?

If the Wish is Fulfilled explores different answers to this question in six separate one-shots. Best friends struggle with love and life; a young buck chases after his not-so-doe-eyed teacher; two brothers learn about themselves and each other; an incorrigible yakuza heir and his exasperated mentor butt heads; two salarymen fall unexpectedly in love; and a lifelong friendship takes a bittersweet turn.

Poignant and humorous, Tatsuki conveys the ups and downs of these young men's lives through an elegant blend of human emotions, engaging dialogue, and intricate artwork.
