Toraji is the leader of the delinquents group enrolled in a certain school. That technical high school, full of Yankees, is divided into two gangs, "Toraji gang" and "Ryuuichi gang," and they fight ruthlessly day after day.

Today too, an one-on-one fight was arranged to decide who's gonna be the real leader, but... Suddenly, Toraji's father decided to come out and announced that he just re-married. After a brief moment of shock, Toraji realized his father's partner's son is his opponent, Ryuuichi...?! Now the two rivals end up under one roof... Who's gonna be who? An exciting, thrilling school boys love story.
