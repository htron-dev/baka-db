21 famous murderers are sentenced to death for deep-seated personal vengence. Ryou Takashina is saved from the guillotine at the last minute by a bribe of 2 million dollars and a promise of 1 million a year from the secret police organization EDC. Working under the codename "Hawking" at the same time as the spies of the Cold War between East and West... a tense, violent mystery begins here!
