## Sinopse

Sarasa grew up knowing that her twin brother Tatara was prophesied to be the "boy of destiny," the one who would overthrow the oppressive government and unite the people. When Tatara dies in battle, however, Sarasa realizes that it's up to her to secretly take on her brother's identity. On the way, Sarasa meets and falls in love with the mysterious Shuri, who may also have something up his sleeve. Together, she and her group of ragtag fighters journey across the land, attacking the many rulers and hoping to someday reach the leader of them all, the Red King.
