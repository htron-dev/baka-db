    "sinopse": "Odagiri Yuki, a brilliant surgeon, is also known as the “Absolute Zero Angel” for his ice-cold aloofness with people, and his soulful compassion when he operates on patients. Haunted by a lover’s death, Yuki consoles himself with drugs and sex—… This piques both personal and professional interests in Mine, a neuropsychologist, who accepted Kuneida’s request to cure his friend’s coldness. What would it take to melt the “Absolute Zero Angel”?\n\n(Source: Fantasy Shrine)",
