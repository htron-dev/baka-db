## Sinopse

Najika Kazami is passionate about food and the connections people can make by sharing their favorite dishes. She possesses an absolute sense of taste and can easily discern the ingredients and method of preparation of anything she eats. Anju Takanashi, a classmate of Najika, comes to her and asks if she can recreate a certain dessert her grandmother once enjoyed. With nothing more than a "fluffy and heavenly" taste and a connection to her deceased parents to help her achieve her goal, Najika wonders if she will ever figure out what the mysterious confection is.
