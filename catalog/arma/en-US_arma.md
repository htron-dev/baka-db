## Sinopse

What if you developed superpowers that could change your life only to discover that these incredible abilities only worked on...animals? When you're teenager Jin Lee, that's a pretty strange concept to wrap your head around—especially when you wish your destructive powers could help you overcome the bullies who torment you at school instead. But Jin is quickly learning that there's a place in this world for a special individual like him—and he's definitely not the only one of his kind out there.
