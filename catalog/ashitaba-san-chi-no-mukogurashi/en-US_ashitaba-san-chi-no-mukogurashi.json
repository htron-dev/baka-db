However, the house is composed mainly of females who are all used to a lifestyle without the presence of a man.\n\nAnd thus, Hinata's mother, aunt, and two younger sisters will have to adjust to Mutsumi's entry into their family and learn to give him some personal space and privacy. But old habits die hard and Mutsumi soon realizes that life as an Ashitaba's husband is not easy.\n\n[Source My Anime List]",
