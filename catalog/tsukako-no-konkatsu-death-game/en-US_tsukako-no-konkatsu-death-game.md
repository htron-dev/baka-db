## Sinopse

28-year-old otaku Tsukako Suzuki visits a marriage consulting office, but the counselor there is a shinigami who forces a contract on her and tells her that if she can't get married in a year, she'll die. Because of her selfish and ill-natured personality combined with her lack of experience in relationships and the arrogant view that she'll be able to effortlessly find the dream partner without spending the time or money, the system calculates that her chance of success is 0.03%. So that she can live to see the future of her favorite 2d idol group, she accepts the challenge.
