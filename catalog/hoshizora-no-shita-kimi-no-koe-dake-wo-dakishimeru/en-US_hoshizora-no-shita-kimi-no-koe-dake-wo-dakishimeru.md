## Sinopse

Shuu is a member of the literary club who can't write. One day, he gets a mysterious message on his phone from a girl called Eina, and from that impulsive contact, they begin to exchange messages. They talk of things like their shared interest in novels and grow close. However, when they try and meet, they discover a shocking truth. Eina lives... not in the present, but five years in the past! How will their love develop, parted by five years of nights...!?
