## Sinopse

Akimoto is the owner of a small variety shop. One day, an unsociable picture book author named Laurence shows up at his doorstep. Laurence came to Japan for work and Akimoto, at a friend's request, begins to look out for him during his stay. He then discovers that Laurence is the author of "Anneli," a book Akimoto holds very dear.
