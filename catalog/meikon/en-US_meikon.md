## Sinopse

“Would you be my mate for life?”

For the sake of his little patient, Resident Doctor Yashiro Takashi agreed to a bet with the beautiful doll maker, Kuze Shinobu, who claimed to be his “destined one”. Unaware of their intertwined fate, Takashi had bonded himself with Shinobu in a spirit marriage.
