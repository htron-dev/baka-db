Oscar is a simple working man, keeping his head down to earn his money and support an orphanage, until Miledi Reisen bursts into his life. She wants Oscar to join her in a quest to defeat the gods. Oscar refuses to chase after that kind of danger... until that kind of danger finds its way to him.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
