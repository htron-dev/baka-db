## Sinopse

Freshman Anzu Satou has always been praised by both students and teachers at Wakabayama High School and has always had an active school life. When she was having one of those days where everything goes wrong, she stumbles upon Hinata Café, owned and operated by Hinata Kaede, a strange girl around her age. Mysteriously drawn inside the shop, Anzu opens up to Hinata about her best friend stealing her boyfriend and her teachers denying her wishes of becoming a voice actor. Suddenly feeling like a weight was lifted off her shoulders, Anzu becomes really interested in Hinata and they come to be very good friends.
