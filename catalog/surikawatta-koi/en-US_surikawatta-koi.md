## Sinopse

Rosabelle had to leave her beloved family when she married and moved to London. When her husband dies, she's exhausted and in need of much R and R, but is only allowed a short visit to her dear family home. That's when her twin sister, Annabelle, proposes an incredible scheme. "It'll be all right. We're identical. Nobody will notice." And so the two women switch places! That way, Rosabelle's able to rest and recuperate at home... until she meets the young man next door, Phillip Winbolt. What will Rosabelle do now that she's fallen in love with this man... all while under the guise of her sister, Annabelle?
