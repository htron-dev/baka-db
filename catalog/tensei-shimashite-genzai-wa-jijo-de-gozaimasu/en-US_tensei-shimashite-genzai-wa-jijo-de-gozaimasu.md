## Sinopse

Yulia reincarnates into a minor subcharacter of an otome game before the start of the main story and the one she is employed under as a maid is the princess who will make an appearance as the game's villain?! "As if I would allow such an adorable princess to become a villainess!" With that resolution in her mind, Yulia will use the knowledge from her previous life as an office lady as well as the livelihood magic only she can use to guide the princess along in place of finding love for herself! Rumors of Yulia's capability as a maid spread as she heads the development of sweets, the manufacturing of local specialties, and even gets involved in the trouble between two countries?! This is a fantasy story of a competent maid who has fortuitously found her life's calling.
