## Sinopse

After seven years, Leo Koyanagi runs into Akito Oshinomi, a former classmate that dropped out of school, at a high school reunion. Akito had quit high school during their second year when photos of him having sex with men began circulating among the students. Though Leo and Akito were not close, Leo saved those photos and jacked off to them in secret. For years, Leo harbored a hidden lust for Akito that flared up again when he reunites with Akito at the reunion. Wanting to blow off steam after seeing Akito, Leo heads over to a blowjob bar. Little does he know, Akito also works there...
