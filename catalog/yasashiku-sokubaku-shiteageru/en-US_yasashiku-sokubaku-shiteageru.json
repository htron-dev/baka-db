He's attracted to his image of a naked innocence and the role that the gap in front of the camera plays. He begins to approach that gap, but when it's time to take pictures for a commercial campaign, Ooshiro finds kiss marks all over Nao's body. Bothered by his feelings of betrayal, Ooshiro realizes for the first time his deep feelings for Nao. But where does he go from here?\n(from B-U)",
