## Sinopse

Junior high student Ken Ishii is good at nothing but getting out of trouble. An unidentified man appears before Ken as he is running away from hoodlums trying to pick a fight, like usual. The man asks "Do you know Zuieki Nogi?" and Ken shakes his head. Two onlookers observe them from a hiding place. The unidentified man unleashes a monster, catching Ken who is unable to get free. On the verge of death, something changes within Ken’s body…!? “Stand up as a ‘Shinobi’leader!” This is his destiny, to be shackled to a dying shinobi family’s fate... (Source: Jmanga)
