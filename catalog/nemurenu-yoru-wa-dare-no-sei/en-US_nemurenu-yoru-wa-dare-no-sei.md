## Sinopse

Miyabi identifies as straight. Shuuhei is an out and proud gay man. The only connection the two have is a past sexual encounter that rears its awkward head when they're unexpectedly assigned to share a dorm room. Wary of each other, the two try to come to a mutual understanding, but Miyabi is very doubtful about Shuuhei's assertion that love and sex are two entirely different matters. And why does he care so much? He's a straight man...right? (Source: DMP)
