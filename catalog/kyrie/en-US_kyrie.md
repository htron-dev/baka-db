In a world where social class is completely decided by race, Shigure, who was promoted to a Holy Knight despite being born from the lower wolf race, meets Kyrie of the cursed snake race Katara in a church and believes that he is the messenger of God. He develops a love for the snake and this eventually turns into an uncontrollable passion.
