## Sinopse

Collection of one-shots by Yukimura

1. Fushigi Amedama
   Yoshimoto hates how Matsuda always tells him that he loves him, so much so that it cause a bit of a problem when they're working together for a professor packing up a lot of his strange, occult-related items. Because Yoshimoto runs off, but Matsuda stays to finish the job, the professor gives Matsuda a piece of strange candy saying that, with it, he can command one person to do one thing. Yoshimoto is scared. What command will Matsuda make?

2. Yashiro no Naka
   Yoshimoto is on a trip stuck with Matsuda as his traveling companion. Considering it's Matsuda's fault Yoshimoto got dumped, things could be better. But life with Matsuda is always interesting especially when the fox spirits show up...
