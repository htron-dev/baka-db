"Your father embezzled company money. Marry me if you don't want me to disclose it." Four years ago, Isobel married a man she didn't love without telling the truth to Lorenzo, who she truly loved. Soon after her husband dies in a traffic accident, Lorenzo appears! He went to the U.S. after they broke up and has achieved great success. He now offers to acquire Isobel's father's company, which is in financial difficulty! "I rejected him four years ago. Is this his revenge?"
