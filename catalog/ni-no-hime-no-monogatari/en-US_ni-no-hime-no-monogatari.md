## Sinopse

This volume contains 3 one-shots by Izumi Kaneyoshi-sensei.

1. Ni no Hime no Monogatari
   In the country of "Kou," the king has no sons, so his three princesses are now in contention for the throne. Ichi no Hime, with her beauty and intelligence, seems the most likely heir, but San no Hime is the king's favorite. Ni no Hime, however, is much too quiet and ignorant to even be considered. This is why Seisui is angry when his father, the king's councilor, makes him Ni no Hime's tutor...

2. Circuit no Joousama
   Ei becomes a race queen and meets Hana and Akane, who teach her that the world of beauty, fame, and money is not all that it seems...

3. Chijou 20m de Aimashou
   Mitsuru and Aya are arguing on the school rooftop about their relationship when they discover Arisa seemingly ready to jump. When they pull her back from the edge, they realize suddenly that the door leading downstairs is locked. What will happen to these three?
