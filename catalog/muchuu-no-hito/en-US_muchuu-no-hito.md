## Sinopse

A gruff, loner office worker has dreams where he’s part of a team that takes orders from an eccentric leader. They’re given odd tasks such as dirtying the laundry or stealing pudding from the opposing team. Initially annoyed, the older guy begins to enjoy the dreams after an adorable high school boy on the other team worms his way into his heart. Turns out, the others are people who exist in real life and share these dreams–so does he have the guts to meet the cute boy in person?
