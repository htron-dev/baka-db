    "sinopse": "In the world of Kabuki, where family social standings are highly valued, Kyounosuke is inept even though he is born as the son of a duke of a famous household. Ichiya while being born in a family that has no connection to Kabuki, is trying to move from the absolute lowest rank to the top using just his ability. Through some kind of karma, these two completely opposite boys have fallen in love with the same girl, Ayame.\n\nThat's where the story begins.\n\nKyounosuke, who wants to be liked by the Kabuki loving Ayame, cries tears of regret because he would throw away all his powerful connections if he could only have real ability. But what if Ichiya, who wants to be the center of Ayame's attention, was adopted into a famous household...?\n\n(Source: Manga Abyss)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Tanaka-san Chi no Takaya-kun\nVolume 4: Utakata no Mirai",
