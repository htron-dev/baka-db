## Sinopse

Haruyoshi, the strongest onmyouji was on the verge of death after the betrayal of his companions. Hoping to be happy in the next life, he tried the secret technique of reincarnation and was sent to a different world! Born into a family of magicians, the magic he failed to inherit was nothing compared to his previous skills as an onmyouji. "Who needs magic? I'll survive in this world with my old techniques!"
