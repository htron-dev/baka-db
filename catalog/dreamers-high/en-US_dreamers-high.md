## Sinopse

Ikuya is not interested in having a girlfriend or boyfriend. Ikuya's childhood friend Kishi just started going out with a boyfriend much older than him. Ikuya feels jealous of Daichi not because he's in a relationship, but because Daichi looks as if he's shining with happiness. But one day Ikuya accidentally saw Daichi and his boyfriend in their bedroom?!
