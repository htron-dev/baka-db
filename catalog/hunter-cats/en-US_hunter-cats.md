## Sinopse

The Hunter Cats are three sisters who work for the Hunter's guild, bounty hunters taking jobs on commission to track down criminals. Hikaru, the oldest sister and de facto leader, possesses incredible speed and agility. Akira, the middle sister, is incredibly tough and can solve any problem through brute force. Mei, the youngest sister, is a prodigy computer hacker and all-around technology wizard. Living in a city full of strange and eccentric criminals, there's no shortage of work, but there's also no shortage of crazy situations...
