    "sinopse": "A beautiful pervert vs. a high school girl!? A high tension romantic comedy overflowing with love and suffering!\n\nFor some reason, Yaeko is incredibly attracted to the weirdest perverts, and so she spends her days either in fear of the people around her or being victimized by them. After a brutal, unexpected betrayal by her friend, the naked and abandoned Yaeko runs into a beautiful man she'd seen earlier that day. Mistaking him for the notorious stuffed-animal-carrying \"Kuro-chan\" molestor she'd heard about on the news, Yaeko attacks and injures him before he has a chance to offer to help her. Feeling guilty, she agrees to take responsibility for her actions by caring for him until he heals. Little does she know that this beautiful man, named Rokuro, is actually a lolicon pervert! Will Yaeko be able to survive her kinky, pervert-infested everyday life?\n\n(Source: MU)",
