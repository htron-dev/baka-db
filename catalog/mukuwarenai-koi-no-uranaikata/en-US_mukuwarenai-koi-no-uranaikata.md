## Sinopse

Minami, a gay fortune teller, has had a crush on his schoolmate, Kitahara, since high school. Kitahara, who has been divorced three times, asked to stay over at his house for a while, and so they started living together. Minami was convinced that Kitahara would never fall in love with him, but the new "crush" Kitahara found was, surprisingly, a man. Taken over by his feelings, Minami ended up kissing Kitahara?! This is a clumsy and endearing unrequited love that sways between friendship and love.
