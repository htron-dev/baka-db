## Sinopse

Suzuki Rokumon wakes up one morning to find a little demon girl, who can use her hair as appendages, preparing breakfast. In the living room he finds another strange demon, who claims to be his new Dad. Rokumon asks where his real Dad is and the demon tells him it is in the next room. Needless to say he's having a pretty bad morning. Thus begins Rokumon's strange new life, with Lucu and her demons, who according to her "want to save the world, and mankind."
