    "sinopse": "When a cute young employee catches the eye of an older female boss, his heartbeat thumps through his blazer! But will his novice moves charm his superior...or make him look like an untrained rookie who's never pleased a fiery woman?\n\nWork for Pleasure proves that it takes passion and dedication to get the hardest (and sweatiest) jobs done right! Will a nerdy analyst take off her glasses for the right man? And can a fun and flirty nurse keep her hands to herself while she's on the clock?\n\n(Source: Project-H)",
