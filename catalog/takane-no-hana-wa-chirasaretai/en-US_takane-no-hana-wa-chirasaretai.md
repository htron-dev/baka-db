## Sinopse

Hana Yukishita is the kind alpha working at Starnyaks Coffee, and Renjaku is the arrogant alpha who is a regular at the cafe. At least that's what the clients think, but Yukishita is actually an omega and has a crush on Renjaku. He couldn't hide his gender anymore when his first heat came unexpectedly... at age 26! And he was seen by none other than Renjaku!
