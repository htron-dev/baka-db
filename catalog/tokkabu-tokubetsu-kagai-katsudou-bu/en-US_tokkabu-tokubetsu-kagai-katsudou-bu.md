## Sinopse

A club made to rehabilitate problem children through community service in the area. That is the "Special Extracurricular Activity Club," nicknamed "Tokkabu!" A self-titled "Amateur Spy" who knows more about machines than anyone and a childhood friend juvenile delinquent who prides herself in her crimes; together they should have begun their activities. However! Their president, Ninomiya Sawa, declared she wants to help the neighborhood as a hero! Little by little, the days of the gentle and passionate Trouble Buster have begun.
