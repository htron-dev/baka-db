## Sinopse

"You are just like my hopeless alcoholic mother," Sarah was told by her first love, Raoul, who took her virginity, before he broke up with her. Five years have passed and Sarah, working as a temp janitor, freezes in front of the elevator. There is Raoul in a suit with a beautiful woman at his side. She wishes not to reveal herself to Raoul, now the head of a bank. He doesn't know her secret, that she had his child, Oliver, and she tries to disappear from the scene.
