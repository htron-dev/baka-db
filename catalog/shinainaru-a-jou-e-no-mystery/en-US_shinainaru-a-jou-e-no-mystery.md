## Sinopse

Ayano is a girl with her head in the clouds: she loves reading so much that she scarcely pays attention to the real world. Hoping to bring her back to reality, Ayano's mother sends her to Noumi Takayuki, a one-time author who now works as a consulting detective. As Takayuki's assistant, will Ayano find a reason to love the world around her? And will she be able to help Takayuki fight his inner sorrows?
