TAKAISHI Minori is a cute and perky female fast-food worker who is adored by all the female customers because she looks like a teen idol--a MALE teen idol. Minori is a tomboy and has short hair, so she is often mistaken for a boy.

She is dazzled by Tomoya, the leader of GOLD. Minori apologizes for her mistake and is about to continue on her way, but not before one of GOLD’s managers sees her and gets a great idea… (Source: ShoujoManga)
