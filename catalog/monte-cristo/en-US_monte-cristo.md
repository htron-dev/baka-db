## Sinopse

The Count of Monte Cristo was once Edmond Dantès, a young man engaged to the lovely Mercédès. After being falsely accused of crimes he did not commit, he is sentenced to life in prison. Now, Dantès has escaped from prison, and he is traveling as the Count of Monte Cristo while searching for his revenge. The story begins in a town where he learns of the plight of a small boy, Marco, through a compassionate young shopkeeper named Rebecca. Marco's mother left the family and his father died, so now he lives alone while working on his father's life project, an Auto Organ Orchestra. The Count of Monte Cristo may be searching for revenge, but he can also help others on his way!
