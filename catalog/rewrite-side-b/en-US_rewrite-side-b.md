## Sinopse

A manga adaptation of Key's ninth visual novel.

The main part of Rewrite's story takes place in the fictional city of Kazamatsuri in Japan, where tree planting and afforestation have caused the city to become overgrown with trees and vegetation. The protagonist Kotarou and his friends in the occult research society attend a high school in Kazamatsuri, and the characters also spend time in the society's clubroom. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the forests of Kazamatsuri and Kotarou's house. Throughout the story, Kotarou encounters an alternate dimension of Kazamatsuri where everything is silent and the sky is gray.
