## Sinopse

Ouri is a girl who dreams of getting married to someone who will protect her, just like her dad protected her mom. When she refuses an arranged betrothal to someone she doesn't know, her mom insists she attends Clover Academy, where there are plenty of fiancee candidates. Rumors about her quickly spread around the school, causing many boys to swarm around her.
Then, caught in a pinch, she's suddenly rescued by a "Meteorite Guardian" named Night, who is now contracted to Ouri to protect her...
