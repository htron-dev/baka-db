    "sinopse": "Haesoo is a cynical writer of a romance column, while Joowon, his former stepbrother, is a famous actor. The two go way back—thrust together when their parents remarried, their relationship is far from simple. Brothers? Soulmates? Friends with benefits? Or nothing at all? Theirs is a delicate balance between lust and loathing, dating and breaking up, irritation and infatuation. When the mysterious photographer \"K\" takes an interest in Haesoo, events begin to spiral out of control. As the lines between art and reality become increasingly blurred, what direction will this story take? Cheap romance? Sensual erotica? Or something much more twisted?\n\n(Source: Lezhin Comics)",
