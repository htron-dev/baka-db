## Sinopse

In a fortuitous moment, the beautiful Mary Albert comes to a sudden realization: the world she currently lives in is not modern Japan, but the world of an otome game she once played—and she is the main villain! In the game's original story, Mary tormented the main heroine. And in the end, she was made an outcast, banished to the frigid northern continent. Now Mary has a second chance, and she intends to do the exact same thing all over again.

Along with her attendant Adi, Mary will do what it takes to ensure her own demise. However, evil is not in her nature, and none of her malicious efforts go as planned... Albert-ke no Reijou wa Botsuraku wo Goshomou desu follows the anything-but-evil villainess and her snarky attendant as they race headlong toward a doomed ending.
