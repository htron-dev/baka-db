## Sinopse

Milk Crown is a story about a 15-year old girl named Tachibana Oto who leaves all her brothers and sisters at the orphanage to go work as a maid in a high school with a dorm (naturally, she will also be taking classes at this school, like everyone else). At this new high school dorm she's staying at, there are some pretty crazy people.
