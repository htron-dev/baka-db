## Sinopse

Ever since they were young girls, best friends Yorino and Haruka have been training to become Bastioners—soldiers who battle in a walled area that protects humanity from the kaiju trying to break through. But when Haruka is killed during a routine exercise, Yorino must fight even harder to make sure she never loses someone close to her again.
