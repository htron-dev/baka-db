## Sinopse

Haruto is the son of the head priest of Hibiragi shrine. Kano, the daughter of the tatami maker living next door to the shrine, began learning Japanese archery because she was deeply impressed by the sight of Haruto and him drawing a bow. Separated by a tragic event, the two meet again several years later.

The story revolves around Kano and Haruto, who remain at a cautious distance—neither too close nor too far—as they grow up. It depicts with a certain tension the fine subtleties of feeling experienced in the difficult adolescent years.
