## Sinopse

College student Yoichi helps a swan stuck on a bridge, only to be visited later in the night by Miwa, a beautiful woman claiming to have been the same swan Yoichi rescued. Miwa stays with Yoichi to pay back her debt, but Yoichi harbors doubts about Miwa really being a swan. With his uneasiness, is there hope for a relationship between Yoichi and Miwa?
