## Sinopse

Set in the Edo period of Japan, the high-ranking daimyo of the Mito domain cannot keep his bodyguards alive as they travel Japan. To replenish his bodyguards, they institute a recruitment exam aimed towards the poorest of samurais of Japan, "rounin." As a rounin, Shinnosuke Inouse attempts to prove himself to the ranking officials and escape poverty.
