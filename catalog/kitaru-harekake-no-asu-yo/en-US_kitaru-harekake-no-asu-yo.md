## Sinopse

Harehito and Oujirou are trash collectors. Harehito's hands can fix anything, like magic. When Oujirou's heart is broken, Harehito's hand, warm on his back, brings him to life. Once again, a request comes in to pick up a dormant boy. It's another sweltering day. Just like the day Harehito "collected" Oujirou as trash.
