    "sinopse": "Harehito and Oujirou are trash collectors. Harehito's hands can fix anything, like magic. When Oujirou's heart is broken, Harehito's hand, warm on his back, brings him to life. Once again, a request comes in to pick up a dormant boy. It's another sweltering day. Just like the day Harehito \"collected\" Oujirou as trash.\n\n(Source: Printemps Shuppan, translated)",
