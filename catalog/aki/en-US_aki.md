## Sinopse

Mahjong is all Nikaido Aki knew growing up. With her parents operating a Mahjong shop where people would gather to play the game, it served as a good time for Aki, her older sister Rumi and their family. But when their mother leaves them out of the blue, their father is forced to close the shop and he leaves Aki and Rumi with relatives. With no real goal in life and not even sure if she wants to continue on to high school, Aki has to figure out what she wants out of her life.
