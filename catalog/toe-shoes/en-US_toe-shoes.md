## Sinopse

After watching her first ballet performance, Morino Kurumi aspired to become a great ballerina. She entered Hosaka Ballet School and worked towards being the best of her group.

Two years after starting ballet, Kurumi is still as eager as ever to become a great ballerina. She meets Hosaka Kazuomi, a young man who further motivates her to become the best. But moving up in this world wasn't so easy, as Kurumi soon gained a great number of problems blocking her goal—from the jealously of her fellow dancers to Kurumi's apparent shortness. Will Kurumi be able to become the great ballerina she has wanted to be?
