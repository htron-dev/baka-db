## Sinopse

Tsuyoshi is 9 years old and had friends over to play. During a tumble a photo breaks of his mother holding a baby. On the back of the photo is a date, written two years before his birth, so Tsuyoshi asks his father "whose child is this?" His father tells him the story of his older brother who died at birth and learns the importance of life.
