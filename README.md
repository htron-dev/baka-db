## About the catalog

All the items are in the catalogs folder, and we have one folder for any material related to the item.
So if the item have a tv-serie, tv-serie second season, ova, movie, manga, visual novel, etc.. all this will be in the same folder.

You will notice that all files have a prefix like en-US or pt-BR this tell what the language is the file and is how the project handle the translations.

## Item

For the name of an item in catalog we use the first name know of the item like the name of original source for example.

And if you looking for a translated version check the prefix of the file Ex: `[lang]_tv-series.md`.
