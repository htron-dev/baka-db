## About the catalog

All the content of database are in the catalogs folder, each folder represents a project that contents the medias that this project may have.

So for example if we have an anime called "Naruto" and a manga called "Naruto" both of they will go in project folder "naruto", and also if exist another season, ova, movie, special, or anything that is related to the project "naruto" it will also be is this folder.



## Translations
You will notice that all files in the database have a prefix like `en-US` or `pt-BR`, this tell what is the language that the content is written.

With that we can have the data in multiple languages in the database.

Ex:

- `en-US_naruto-tv-series.md`
- `pt-BR_naruto-tv-series.md`
